It  is  difficult   to  see  at  first  how   language  enters   into   Arakawa  and   Gins’ architectural body,  but it is already presupposed in the closely argued Built- Discourse. For example, it is in the description of the house  (or the architectural surround), in the  hypothesis of the  bioscleave, in the  procedures for staging an intervention into the passive framework of formal  architectural language- description (i.e., “theory”). As they  write,  “If architectural procedures serve  as the words of a built  discourse, then  tactically  posed surrounds, combining these procedures as they  do,  are  its phrases, sentences, paragraphs, and  texts”  (Gins Arakawa 2002L: 57).
