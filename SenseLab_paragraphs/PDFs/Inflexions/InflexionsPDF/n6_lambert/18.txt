A  fundamental  perspective  is  revealed,  however,  when  we   realize   that   a “person” can never  be extricated from surroundings, raising  the question of how far  into  the  environment does  the  organism of  the  person extend, and  more crucially, how  far into  the  organism does  the  environment extend to determine the nature of the person found there.  “Moving within an architectural surround, a person fashions an evolving matrix  … not  entirely of his or her  own  making” (2002: 40). The person that  I am or who  sits next  to me in the airport lobby,  the person I am  or who  I imagine sitting  in a chair  at home  – are  these  not  merely two expressions of the architectural body  that  confines  or bounds that  particular kind  of person one expects  to find there.  When  I am at home  I am someone, just as when I am at the airport I am anyone, just like anyone else, and  this is how  I piece  together my  role  in a multiplicity of actions  as I get  into  line  or take  my assigned seat  in an  intricate ballet  of landing site coordination, just  as when at home  I follow  the coordinates established by routine and  habit.  As A + G write, “standard rooms  evoke  a relatively predictable set of actions.  In the good  fit of a familiar room,   one  feels  the  tentativeness underlying  actions   that  have  been molded” (43). Moreover, “One’s  living  room  is and  isn’t one’s  own  sensorium. All that  is tentative is in the realm  of the sensorial; all that  appears to be definite has been physically constructed” (42).
