Finally,  in exploring the notion of the bioscleave, in relation to the organism that persons and that takes up an environment, let us begin as A + G do with a simple organism:  a  snail.  Here,   we  are  immediately given   the  image   of  a  cramped bioscleave, which  is easier  to  get  into  than  to  get  out.  The  human snail  is no different and  the  problem will  also  be  one  of  getting out,  that  is,  increasing lifespan. The embryo, generated in the womb,  passes  with  difficulty into another bioscleave, the body.  However, as Lacanian psychoanalytic theory has taught us, the  human snail  body  (the  primitive outer  shell  of the  person excreted by  the organism) is already determined by what  A + G call an “insufficient procedural bioscleave hypothesis,” since according to Lacan all human snails  are born prematurely. It is in this  organic prematurity (or “insufficiency” to use  A + G’s term)  that  is “built  into”  the primary bioscleave that  conditions the construction of prosthetic supplements, external bioscleaves that  are excreted around the first
