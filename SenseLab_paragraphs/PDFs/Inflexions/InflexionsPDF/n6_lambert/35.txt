First observation on the poem:  here we see the process  by which  the humansnail (the organism that  persons) first forms  the primary medium from  its immediate environment – its first outer  shell that it exudes or excretes  out of its own organs, its body,  for lack of a better  term  – that  then  is “taken up”  and  dispersed in its supplementary shells  (i.e., architectural surrounds). “Taken  up”  and  exuded or excreted implies that the “on the spot awareness” that defines the perception- consciousness system  of the  first  medium (the  body)  is dispersed into  landing- site  coordinates  via  architectural  procedures.  In  other   words,  here   we  find A + G’s definition of “the person” as an ubiquitous site in a complex information management system.
