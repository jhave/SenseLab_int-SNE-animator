persons finds  the  new  territory that  is itself,  and,  having found it, adjusts  it” (2002: 1). Returning to A + G’s earlier  maxim,  persons cannot  be extracted from their  surroundings, and  this  results in  multiply determined surrounds  and  a whole  differenciation of the  organism into  a species.  A species  is just  a person according to a different scale, just as a microorganism persons according to the opposite pole  of the  same  scale.  “An  organism casts  itself  onto  the  world as a person, and  wavers continually between existing  as an  organism [as a species] and  as a person [organisms co-determined by environments]; moreover, “if organisms form  themselves as persons by uptaking the  environment, then  they involve  not   only   bodies   but   domains  [territories],  spheres  of  activity   and influence”  (66).   Just   as   in   the   philosophy  of   Whitehead,  or   in   D + G’s nomadology, there  is no  privileged perspective from  which  to  enter  the  scale, which    is   why    A + G   often    introduce   molecular  perceptions   (Lilliputian perspectives) into  their  determination of  the  architectural surround  alongside much   larger   scales   such   as  that   of  Gulliver  moving  through  the   town   of Mildendo, the capital  of Lilliput.  Consequently, as they  write  in their  directions for use,  “construct more  than  one scale of operation” (77), and;  “Not  a series  of actions  that  take  place  on  this  scale  of  action  or  that  but  the  coordinating of different scales of actions  makes  a person able to construct a world” (63).
