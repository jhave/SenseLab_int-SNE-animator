the  next  architectural surround  to  digest   its  coordinates by  the  same   set  of procedures. This constitutes the in and out pattern of breathing that directly links the  organism to the  environment composed of architectural surrounds that  are like hardened media “thick  with  one’s own  breathing.” Consequently, here  we have  the  image  of the  architectural body,  in which  the  external surround is not reduced to a static set of coordinates, but a living  articulation of procedural construction of sited awareness.
