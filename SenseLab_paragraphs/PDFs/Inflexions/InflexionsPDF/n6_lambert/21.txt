Here   we  might   imagine  dying,  or  the   moment  of  death,  purely  from   the perspective of a near zero-degree of interplay between the person and  the surrounding  environment to  the  point   of  being  isolated and  indifferent. This growing indifference between the organism that  a person needs  to construct as a living   hypothesis  of  holding  itself  in  place   within  its  own   surroundings  is gradually let go of until  the organism itself submits to becoming detached from the person entirely. Thus, death happens by detaching a person from its tentative constructing of holding itself in place.  Thus,  even  in sleep,  the person still holds itself in place  via the  tentative constructing of dreamwork which  pertains to its own environment, but which  is still attached to the organism that breathes in and out of its bioscleave. But let us also think  of children playing video  games  on the living  room  floor, which  in some  ways  also emulates this dream environment in the interaction with  virtual space;  rather than  being  interpreted negatively, they are also performing this activity  of tentatively constructing a holding in place. In other  words, they are still resisting dying.
