the body.” Rather  than  being  passively determined by formal  architectural environments,  which    has   been   the   dominant  procedure theoretically and practically, the  point   would be  to  activate the  heuristic activity   of  a  person defined as a “tentative constructing of a holding in place.”  In other  words, “Our claim:  architecture can  help  a person figure  herself  out”  (2002: 44). Helping a person figure  herself  out  is related to  “getting out”  of a currently constructed bioscleave that  is too  constrained and  confining; in turn,  for A + G, this  means extending life –   and  simultaneously, proposing an  architectural surround that appears “against dying.”
