A + G’s definition of procedural architectural is, in some way, related to Deleuze and  Guattari’s definition of “order-words.” D + G didn’t say  this,  or make  this connection explicit,  so  I will  do  it  for  them.  Architects are  always producing order  words  (procedural  directives)  of  a   specific   kind;   they   exist   in   the combination of schemata and cognitive directives that are communicated directly to  an  inhabiting organism through what  A + G   call  landing sites.  “Here  is a door:  enter/exit here.”  “Here  is a window: look  out/in here.”  “Here  is a table with  chair: sit here.”  “Here  is a hallway: proceed to the next landing site.” These are  simple  compositions of schemata and  directives that  can  be found in most tactically  built  surrounds. There are others  that  are far more  totalizing: “This is a house:  live here.”  “This  is an office building: work  here.”  “This  is a restaurant: eat here.”  “This is an airport: proceed to the next landing site.”
