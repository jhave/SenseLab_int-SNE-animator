Is there  a possibility of “free  indirect discourse” in the  architectural surround? A + G  define   the  ubiquitous site  of  the  architectural body   as  “the  set  of  all landing sites of each moment that define  a given  architectural configuration. As I have  attempted to  describe earlier  on,  architectural procedures that  determine the  possibilities of movement and  sense  belonging to an architectural surround can be comparable to what  Deleuze and  Guattari define  as “order words,” or to the set of all order-words that  define  the possibility of a language. The point  is, just as in the construction of sense in a poem,  to introduce what  A + G constantly refer to as “tentativeness” into the procedural order, which  could  be compared to the   tentativeness   of   certain    phrases  in   a   poem:    the   apparent  tentative constructions of phrases like “he  danced his did”  in a poem  by Cummings, the neologisms of Carroll,  the syntactical awkwardness of Berryman or Celan,  or in the poetry of Gins herself.  Thus,  the tentative constructing of a holding in place that  is enacted by the  poem  could  provide us with  a procedural hypothesis for entering the  architectural surround in a new  manner, and  adjusting  it to one’s own  living  configuration. Entering a room  like making a poem.  This could  be a way  of understanding the sense  of the statement tentative constructing of a holding in place in A + G’s work.
