Procedural directives are  not  simple   prescriptives in  the  order of  statements, “one  should,” but  are  directed to  the  action   or  possibility  of  the  inhabiting organism:  “you   should.” The  relationship  between architectural statements – even   though  these   are  not  spoken  statements  but   implicated  in  the  spatial construction – and  directives of authority or power is much  more  subtle  because architectural statements first  of  all  define  possibility (of  action  or  movement) before revealing their  constraining or power-function. Procedural directives combine with  schemata to compose the  intricate poetry of a tactical  surround: When  I enter  a  room,  the  door  has  already been  offered   to  me  like  a  polite bellman, and  then  a window comes  into  view  as what  A + G   call a perceptual landing site;  I glance  out  of  the  window at  a  tree  just  outside and  its  leaves lightly   tickling   the  glass,  suddenly  exfoliating the  perceptual landing site  to encompass an external façade  of the structure which  is used  as a canvass to paint the internal affect of peaceful contemplation and  a qualitative perception of taste into the surround. In this set of procedures I am not even  aware that  I am being ordered from  one  point  to  the  next,  or  that  the  tree  has  been  tactically  placed there  several  years before so that it would grow  into the tactically  built surround.
