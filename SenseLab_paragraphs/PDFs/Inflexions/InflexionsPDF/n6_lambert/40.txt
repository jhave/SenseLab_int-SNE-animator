description of “the  house  of Being.” Language is too abstract, and  the syntactical coordination of its phrases, sentences, paragraphs (or stanzas) and  texts does  not convey  the  sense  of the  tentative holding in  place  of the  person that  appears within an  architectural surround. Nevertheless, the  poem  does  intimate a new way  of imaging the  architectural body  and  we  might  imagine now  entering a room  in the same  way  one constructs a poem,  by means  of a tentative procedure of combining the elements of “free indirect discourse” in a set of all order-words that belong  to language at a given moment.
