Like performative statements in language, architectural directives are made  to be obeyed and  not understood; again,  they are not functions of cognition, but rather of action  and  directly link  the  possibilities of the  organism to the  architectural surround,  constraining it  to  act  as  much   as  giving   it  shape   and   form   (for example,  that   of  a  person  who   belongs   to  a  particular  environment  like  a commuter in an airport, or a child laying  on the couch in the family living room). Returning to  the  similarity between D + G’s conception of “order words” and A + G’s formulation of  architectural procedures, it  is  important to  notice  that order-words are not explicit statements and  do not always take the form of imperatives, but  are  rather defined as  immanent relations between statements and  acts that  are internal to the  speech  act and  constitute its “implicit and  non- discursive presuppositions” rather than  its explicit  and  external assumptions by which   a  statement refers  to  another statement or  to  an  action  (Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 77). Likewise  for A + G, “Not  a fixed  set of called  for actions,  an architectural procedure  is  a  spatiotemporal  collaboration between  a  moving body  and  a tactically  posed surround” (Gins and  Arakawa 2002: 73). In founding a theory of language on the  function of order-words, D + G were  attempting to reinsert the priority of pragmatics into any  description of linguistic activity;  it is impossible to define  the internal presupposition of language as a code, or as communication  of  information, even  explicitly   as  command or  performative, because “the  meaning and  syntax  of language can no longer  be defined independently  of  the  speech   acts  they   presuppose,”  and   every   statement  is linked,  directly or indirectly, to an implicit  order of “social  obligation.” Consequently, for DG, “the  only  possible definition of language is the  set of all order-words, implicit  presuppositions, or speech  acts current in a language at a given moment” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 79).
