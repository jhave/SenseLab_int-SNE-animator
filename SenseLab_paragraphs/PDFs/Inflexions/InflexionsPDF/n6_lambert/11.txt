speech-act repeats  what   was  already implicated in  the  order, but  not  in  the manner of a code  that  is deciphered, or information that  is communicated to a passive subject.   Likewise,   in  entering an  architectural surround,  there   are  a number of procedures that  are performed that  are already redundant to the built surround: there  is a chair for sitting  (I sit); there  is a window for looking  through (I look); there  is a table for spreading out papers or a computer for accessing  files (I begin  working). However, these  redundant actions  do  not  take  place  like  a program and  there  is always a certain  degree of indeterminacy in the functioning of the  total  system  that  makes  up  the  architectural body,  which  A + G   seek  to intensify through an increasing awareness of which  might  be compared to what D + G identify in  language as  “free  indirect discourse.” In  this  regard, A + G oppose  the  values   of  form   and   formalism  that   exists  in  much   architectural theory, which  takes  on  an  imperative order;  moreover, we  must  acknowledge that  traditional architectural design is  prone to  a  nearly   fascistic  emphasis of form  over  function, or in making explicit  the  set of order-words that  are  “built into”  any surround, leaving the organism that  inhabits it little or no choice but to obey the commands of the architectural body  (read here: the architect-designer).
