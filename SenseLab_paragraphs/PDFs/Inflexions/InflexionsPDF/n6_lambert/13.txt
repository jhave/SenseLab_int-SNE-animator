Only  procedures and  proceduralism, not  mere  form  or formalism, can   redistribute  and   reconfigure  the   architectural  body   of  an organism that persons. It is not to be forgotten that the architectural body,  a personâ€™s fleeting  association of herself  with  the  whole  of what   encloses   her,  fills  the  whole   of  the  architectural surround, built in procedures included.
