(73).  However,  this   does   not   simply  mean   that   architectural  directives are subliminal messages built  into the surround like codes  of information, or like effervescent signifiers floating   on  the  surface  of  ice  in  a  scotch  glass,  but  are rather  built   into   the   surround  as  conditions  of  possibility  and   experience. Tactically  interposed between perception and  consciousness, A + G define  the interplay that   functions  in  any  built   surround as  “a  scattering  of  nods   that everywhere notes  positionings.” Consequently, as they write,  “a landing-site configuration forms,  as a heuristic device,  when the  continual symbolizing of a symbolizing creature  –  which   can,  in  effect  make   a  symbol   or  metaphor of anything – [that  is, when]  the symbolizing creature becomes  a landing site coordinating creature” (22). It  is  here  we  see  the  complete functioning of the diagram, as a set of schemata functioning in a coordinated arrangement with  a set   of   directives  (“order-words”),   to   constitute  a   more    or   less   complex information management system.  “Landing sites  deliver an  on-the-spot management system.  Information management – that  is what  landing sites  are set up to do” (22). In other  words, A + G do not seek to avoid  the power equation of  the  architectural  diagram,  which   is  already  that   of  a  “training  ground” belonging to a disciplinary regime, but  seek to deploy it in a different direction, that  is, against a previous regime of discipline or training. Thus,  walking into  a building is like entering into a “purposeful guess,” and  there  is much  freedom to explore  a probability structure in  any  direction whatsoever, including what  is presupposed in the built  world, and  “by what  the apportioned out  [probability] comes to be everywhere” (23).
