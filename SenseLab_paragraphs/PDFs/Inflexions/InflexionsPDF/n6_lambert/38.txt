If the  entire  point  of movement is described by A + G as one  of “getting out”  – the humansnail seeks to get out of a surround that  has become  too cramped and constrictive – then  this  happens by withdrawing into  proximity to “its  beloved medium – medium as oneself…”  At the same  time, there  is a notation that  if the humansnail ever  stops   to  rest  in  this  interminable process   of  getting out,  it merely “pulls back  into  its next  pair  of shells.”  Here  we  can  witness a certain Beckettian  sense   of   fatality    and   incredible  humor  in   A + G’s  description, comparable to  the  ending of  Molloy:  “I  can’t  go  on.  I must  go  on.”  In  other words, what   we  find  is  a  depiction of  an  organism that  seeks  to  escape  the constraints of its own  medium only to inevitably exude  and  excrete  more  media in  a space  that  is fundamentally determined as  partes extra partes. This  would imply  that architecture itself is simply a symptom of a particular organism that is stuck in its environment, or rather, stuck to its own medium that it cannot  escape like a mollusk cannot  live outside its own shell.
