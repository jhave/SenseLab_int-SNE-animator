The behaviour of fluid  dynamics in the  Rayleigh-Taylor experiment and  where fluids  of different densities are changing between disturbance and  equilibrium is taken   as  an  inspiration to  approach an  organization of  space  in  motion and without a clear orientation. A column of liquid develops, corrugated in its shape, creates  eddies, ultimately detaches and  breaks  into  discrete drops. Changing its appearance in  density, pattern  and   permeability the  characteristics of  fluid's
behaviour are translated into spatial qualities and surface  articulation.
