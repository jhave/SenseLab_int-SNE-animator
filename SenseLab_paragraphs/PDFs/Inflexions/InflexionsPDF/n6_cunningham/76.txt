Although I go along  with  this notion of self-dispersal, and  accept  the possibility that  we reach  “everywhere” and  that  “everywhere” reaches  us (even  in “homeopathic” doses  and  with  vast  degrees of separation), I would suggest that the   body’s   interface  with   the   “everywhere”  is   not   spherical  but   shaped otherwise, and  that  our  distribution is not  so much  “even,” but  weighted more towards our  body,  our  immediate vicinity,  and  our  perception. We can change our  immediate vicinity  and  we can develop our  perception, reforming our  sense of self to include what  exists  in contact  with  and  beyond our  body  in order to better  be able to ask questions of our  surroundings and  to hear  and  respond to the questions our surroundings pose of us.
