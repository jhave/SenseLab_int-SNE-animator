Apart from  the  delight I  had   in  re-experiencing  these  sensations  after  some absence,   and   the   momentary  cessation  of  pain   during  the   exercise,   what fascinated me most  was that  I was experiencing the illusory nature of perception
– that  our  body  image  and  proprioception are constructs in our  mind’s eye, that may or may not truly  reflect the movement, position or shape  of our actual  body. This  dimensionalizing landing site  of a “virtual” limb  was  fundamental to my further research into  how  awareness of body  image  within surround can  fuel performative movement in connection with object and architecture.
