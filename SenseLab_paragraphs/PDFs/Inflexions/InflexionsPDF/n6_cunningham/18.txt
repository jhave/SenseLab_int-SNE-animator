When  I sense  my body  in relation to the environment in this  way,  and  begin  to relate   to  the  outside  environment on  a  physical level,  I  free  up  the  infinite possibilities  of  moving  or   positioning  myself   in   relation  to   things.  I  also experience shifts in perception, and can see that viewpoints are mutable.
