In a choreographic research period in a local hall in 2003, I explored further the notion of connecting my mind-body to the architectural features of the room  by first  observing the  lines  and  structures of the  roof  beams,  skirting boards, and long  uninterrupted wall  surfaces. Imagining  connections between  myself  and those  lines, I would then  configure my body  in relation to those  “landing sites,” while  sensing, sitting  within, or  re-configuring the  “dimensionalizing landing sites”  that  form  in  the  spaces  existing  between my  body  and  the  wall,  ceiling beam,   and   skirting  board.  These   spaces   are   perceived  as   tri-dimensional geometric volumes bound by  lines  joining  the  outer  extremities of my  body’s surface   and   certain   points  (often   joints)   on  the  surface   of  the  architectural structure.  Any  one  of these  volumes, emanating as  they  usually do  from  flat surfaces, terminate at my end  in an organic form created by the part  of my body currently protruding into  it.   Stillness  and  awareness allow  these  volumes to form, which  are constructed within a series of “hook-and-rope ensembles” which have  caught hold  on  multiple availing surfaces creating a tension – the  “as-if- tugging-back-to-the-body that  conveys a sense  of (kinesthetic) depth” – within a volume. Movements I make  within one of these  said  volumes, towards or away from the “availing surfaces,” expands and  contracts the volume like the breath in one’s  lungs.   Furthermore,  the  action   of  breathing  itself  can  be  perceived  as increasing and  releasing pressure on the  volume existing  between body  surface and  architectural surface,  which  allows  the architecture to seemingly seep in and out of a few layers  of skin, like the exchange point  between oxygen  and  blood  in the lungs,  creating a sense of breathing the walls.
