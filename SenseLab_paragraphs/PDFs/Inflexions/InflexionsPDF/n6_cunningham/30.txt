Our  tentative enquiry is  amplified into  larger   scales  of  action/interaction  in Tuning Fork: Drill Hall, where we lift, get underneath, move,  reform  and  re-locate strips  of the linoleum dance  floor of Sydney’s Critical  Path  choreographic development space,  the  Drill  Hall.  Foregrounding the  materials, objects, architectural structures,  letting   them   have  a  life  of  their  own,  we  lend  them movement and  form. The structures and  materials become  the “performers” and propose questions that  pop  up  in our  and  audience members’ minds: How  does that   material  move?   How   heavy   is  it?  What   will  happen  to  the   “human” performers  if  it  collapses  and   traps   them?   Interacting  with   the  material  or watching from the outside, one realises  that  surfaces are not actually fixed. Their fixedness exists only in our  minds because of the function that  are “assigned” to them.   When  one  un-assigns  surfaces, structures,  objects  from  their  functions, they   are  open   for  interpretation,  co-exist   in  a  level   playing  field   with   the “organisms-persons” (Gins  and  Arakawa 2002: xix) they  share  the  space  with,
