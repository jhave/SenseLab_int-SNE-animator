Taking  this  mode  of awareness into  performative practices, I discover there  are options, many  pathways. I'm connected in three  dimensions, and  can sense  the spaces  existing  between myself  and  the walls, the floor, and  the ceiling. I become attuned to  my  proximity to  these  structures, and  can  begin  to  play  with  the orientation of my body  to their surfaces.
