This  paper comes  about  as  a response to  reading Architectural Body (Gins  and Arakawa 2002). My initial  reaction, which  went  something like “Wow,  they  are naming and  describing what  I’ve been  noticing and  exploring through my performative and  meditative practices in recent  years,”  catalysed me  to have  a crack, myself,  at articulating those  perceptions of mine  that  illustrate, or at least resonate strongly with, the ideas  presented in Architectural Body.
