Through the Feldenkrais Method, which  I first encountered in 1987, I have  come to understand, on  a somatic  level,  three  major  connections between neurology and  movement:  first,  that  the  form  of  any  movement the  body  would make already exists in the neurological impulse for that  movement; second, in order to free  oneself  from  restrictive patterns of movement one  must  examine the  very moment when the thought impulse reaches  the muscles and;  third, visualising a movement (whilst  not  enacting it)  is enormously effective  in  learning how  to enact  that  movement in a freer way.  Visualisation, non-judgemental observation and  attention to the infinitesimal beginnings of movement have  all played a part in the development of my practice.
