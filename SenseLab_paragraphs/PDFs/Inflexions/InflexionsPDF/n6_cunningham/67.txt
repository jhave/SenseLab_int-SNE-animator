In Tuning  Fork, through the  use  of rods,  I began  interacting more  directly with the volumes in space  between surround and  myself.  Taking  a bunch of 3m-long carbon  fibre  rods,  I find  ways  to distribute my  body  weight into  the  rods,  floor and  wall, or window, or step, or whatever surface-point the rods  terminate at. By allowing weight and  movement to be distributed into  the  rods,  and  extending my  attention out  through the  rods,  I am  able  to experience tactile  landing sites remotely, that  is, from  a distance of up  to  three  metres, and,  as  “tactility and kinesthesia  toggle-switch into  one  another” (Gins  and  Arakawa 2002: 37), in effect have  the sense  that  my body  or self actually traverses this distance, or that there  is a co-joining  of self and surround, within and throughout the body-object- architecture configuration.
