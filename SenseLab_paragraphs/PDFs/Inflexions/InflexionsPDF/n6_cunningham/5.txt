I have  been  working with  the  principles of Al Wunder’s Theatre of the Ordinary since 1997. Practitioners improvise movement, stillness, sound and  silence  while bringing  their   awareness  to  the  subject   of  a  given   “score”.   Scores  used   for accessing  and  playing with  vision  include “looking and  not  looking,” “direct looking,  peripheral looking  and  ‘unsighted’ looking,” and  “using ‘clear-sighted’ vision”  (Wunder 2009: 154). “Looking and  not  looking” is a score  that  is often done  in pairs,  as a way  of developing relationship between two  improvisers in terms  of orientation, spacing, and  timing. In “direct looking,  peripheral looking and  ‘unsighted’  looking” awareness develops around  how  we  choose  to  see others  in the space – either  by directly looking  at them  or by keeping them  in the corner  of our eye or by keeping them  in our mind’s eye, as they  go in and  out of our  field  of vision.  “Using  ‘clear-sighted’  vision”  is a way  to encourage one  to really  see what  one is looking  at and  to focus on it clearly  enough to take  in the details.
