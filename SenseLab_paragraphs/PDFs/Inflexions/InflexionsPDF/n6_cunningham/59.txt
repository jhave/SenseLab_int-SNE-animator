Directly   evolving  out   of  my   experience  with   pain,   and   also   searching  for experience of simply being, I initiated an ongoing project  in 2007 involving remaining deliberately still for extended periods of time in a range  of wilderness, rural  and  urban locations. These  stillnesses offer  a counterpoint to the  rush  of contemporary life, a way  of being  in the present moment which  draws attention to the  life in and  around me: from  momentary flickerings to patterns of change that occur on large scales and over long periods of time.
