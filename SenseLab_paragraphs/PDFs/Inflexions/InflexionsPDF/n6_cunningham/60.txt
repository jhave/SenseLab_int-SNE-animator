Remaining deliberately still I feel part  of a bigger  whole,  part  of the environment. I experience a kind  of objectivity and  can sense  the  life and  movement of trees, the  weather,  and   time.   In  urban  environments I  perceive  more   clearly   the mechanisms of the  city  – traffic,  commuting, and  the  constant ongoingness of human activity   – the  rhythm of  which,  although perceived over  considerable real-time, presents itself in my  perception as something condensed, like a time- lapse  movie  – a collapsing of timescale and  a transposition of the  past  into  the present. These  deliberate stillnesses might  be considered tactically  posed approaches (rather than  surround), akin  to “tentativeness-cradling procedure: a tactically  posed surround (…) built  in which  the  holding of scale  itself,  surely basic to all holding in place, doesn't hold”  (Gins and Arakawa 2002: 76).
