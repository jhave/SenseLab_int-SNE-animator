[2] The way  the vestibular apparatus functions is explained in detail  by Norman Doidge in The Brain that Changes Itself. In short,  “The balance  system  gives us our sense of orientation in space. Its sense organ,  the vestibular apparatus, consists  of three  semicircular canals  in the  inner  ear  that  tell us  when we  are  upright and how  gravity is affecting  our  bodies  by  detecting motion in  three-dimensional space.”  (Doidge 2010: 3)
