Sometimes,  for  example,  I  am  acutely aware  of  the  position of  my  head   in relation to  the  surrounding structures. “A  dimensionalizing landing site,”  say Arakawa and  Gins,  “registers location  and  position relative to the  body” (Gins and  Arakawa 2002: 21). Whilst  driving, for example, I become  aware of the fact that  my head  holds  a position in relation to the steering wheel,  the windscreen, the  whole  car,  and  other  cars  – which  are  opening, closing  or  maintaining the distance that  exists between themselves and  my car. Then there  are the trees, the road  and  signposts in the distance that  are approaching as the (perceived) gaps between them  are  widening – as the  angle,  of which  I am  the  vertex,  between them  grows.  Focusing my  attention on these  shifting dimensional relationships encourages a tendency at first  to hold  my  head  more  stationary and  allow  my eyes to move  more  freely within their  sockets.  This freedom of movement in the eye-sockets  creates   a  sense   of  stability  within  me,  a  centredness  that   feels something like “I am residing within myself and looking  out”.
