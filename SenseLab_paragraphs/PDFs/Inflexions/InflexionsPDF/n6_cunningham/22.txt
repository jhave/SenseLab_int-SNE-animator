Al Wunder’s definition of performing is “a person forming” (2009). The tentative questioning and  moving within what  is happening and  what  is about  to happen that  occurs  in  his  form  of  improvisation as  performance (which   is  based   on finding at  any  moment what  one  likes,  and  then  playing with  or  constructing moments following moments within and  extending from that  place of value)  is a practice of figuring oneself out – “for part  of being a person is to feel uncertain in regard to and tentative about  what  comes next” (Gins and Arakawa 2002: 45).
