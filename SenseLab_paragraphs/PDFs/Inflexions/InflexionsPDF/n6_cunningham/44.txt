As part  of my  process  to connect,  on a neurological and  cellular  level,  with  the environment  I  am   performing  within,  I  have   used   a  method  of  mentally projecting myself  into  and  onto  architectural surfaces. In the site-specific performance Thanatonauts – Navigators of Death, created with  Igneous in 2001 at the Brisbane  Powerhouse Centre for the Live Arts, I suspended myself  in a fabric sling  hanging from  an  old  steel  eye-let  protruding from  a  rough-hewn  wall. Against and  facing  the wall  and  remaining more  or less stationary I focused my complete attention on the cracks, markings, and  indentations in the surface  of the wall,  moving my attention slowly,  millimetre by millimetre, along  the length  of the  cracks  in the  wall.  Doing  this,  I experienced a perception jump  in terms  of orientation and  scale,  so that  it was  as if I was  flying  above  the  surface  of the Earth  – looking  down onto  canyons, and  diving down and  flying  through those canyons.  Clear-sighted  focus,  coupled  with   the  imaginary  mental  image   (of flying),  formed connections between my body  and  minute details  in the texture of the wall.  My body  responded in minuscule and  subtle  movements to changes in direction or height  of my perceptual journey.
