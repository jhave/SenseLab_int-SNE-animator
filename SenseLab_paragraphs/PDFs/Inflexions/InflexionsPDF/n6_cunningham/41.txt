I have  partial disability of my  left  arm  and  neurological pain  associated with nerve  damage. Researching pain  relief methods, I found a particular experiment immensely profound: the "mirror-box,” designed by neurologist Dr Vilayanur Ramachandran, director of the Center for Brain and  Cognition at the University of California, San Diego,  used  to alleviate amputees of phantom-limb pain. Observing the  movement  of  my  intact   arm   reflected in  a  mirror positioned vertically and  right-facing on  a  table,  I would perceive the  movement of  the reflected image  to be the movement of my left arm.  I would “feel” my paralysed arm  moving again,  along  with  a  complete proprioceptive picture – perceived weight, joint  articulation and  position in  space.  A  bizarre  experience when  I knew  that in fact the immobile arm was lying flat on the table concealed behind a mirror.
