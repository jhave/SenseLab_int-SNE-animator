consciousness is  not  going  out  of  myself  to  those  things, rather there  is  this “residing within myself  and  looking  out”  that  allows  me to remain in-place  and observe things external. While I maintain awareness within my body,  I can sense and    measure   external  changes  in   relation  to   my   own   bodily    structures (positioning,  shape),   internal  processes  (respiration,  salivation,  blood circulation), and  the  physical and  rhythmic relationship of those  internal and external  aspects. I  notice  the  coincidence of  internal and   external events:   an inhalation coinciding with a bird cry, a series of heart  beats with a gust of wind,  a minuscule movement of my  tongue within my  mouth with  the  creak  of the  tin roof expanding under heat  from  the sun.  I feel part  of a composition – a poetic, artistic  event  – within my immediate ecosphere.
