completely contrary to  the  ways  I am  familiar with  personing, and  I am  free, momentarily, dramatically, from  “long-term association (…) with  behaving as a person” (Gins  and  Arakawa 2002: 1) that  myself  as  organism has  had.  New found ways  of personing that  follow  include stillness, experimentation, impulse, intuition, flowing with,  composing, linking  with  architectural features, leaning into, holding and  leaning away  from, fitting  in to negative spaces,  balancing and teetering. “Organisms that  person need  to construct their  hypotheses and  enter them,  surrounding themselves with  ordered presentations of their  suppositions. Our claim: architecture can help a person figure  herself  out.”  (Gins and  Arakawa
2002: 44). I agree  and  add:  a person who  has  gone  some  way  in figuring herself out can help to figure  out her architecture.
