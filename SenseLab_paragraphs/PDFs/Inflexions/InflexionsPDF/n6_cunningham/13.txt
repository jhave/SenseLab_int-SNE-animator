When  I read  Gins and  Arakawaâ€™s discourse on landing sites, particularly dimensionalizing landing  sites   [1],  I  found  a  parallel  to  my   own   personal experience. There  is a quality of awareness that  enhances my ability  to perceive and  map  my relationship to my surroundings within the framework of dimensionalizing landing sites.
