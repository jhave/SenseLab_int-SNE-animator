he sweeps it back and  forth, and  has only one point,  the tip, feeding him  information through the  skin  receptors of the  hand. Yet this sweeping allows   him  to  sort  out  where the  doorjamb is,  or  the chair,  or distinguish a foot when he hits it, because it gives  a little. Then  he  uses  this  information to guide himself  to the  chair  to sit down. Though his hand sensors are where he gets the information and   where the  cane  ‘interfaces’  with   him,  what   he  subjectively perceives is not  the  cane’s  pressure on  his  hand but  the  layout of the  room:  chairs,  walls,  feet, the  three-dimensional space.
