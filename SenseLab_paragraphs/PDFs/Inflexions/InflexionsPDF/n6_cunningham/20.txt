“habitable and  animate,” and  give the sense that  “something is happening – something  that   needs   attending  to”   (Stewart  2007:  4,  5).  And   just   as  the apparition of an image  on a Polaroid is the result  of a chemical process,  gravity too,   acting    on   the   body    whilst    holding   in   place    these    unconventional orientations, is a catalyst for an internal process  that  causes  a shift in perception which   allows   an  inner   sense  of  sited-ness to  occur,  or  to  dissolve from  the sensing  of  one  site  to  the  sensing  of  another.  I  imagine  that   the  vestibular apparatus would also  be playing a role  in these  perception shifts,  as with  each holding in place it could  be undergoing a kind  of recalibration into each new orientation, giving  the sense  of “arriving” at a new  site.
