purpose and  position in architectural space, its way of moving and  being manipulated. I would approach a door,  in a way,  as if it were  not a door,  and  to physically ask  questions  of,  to  play  with,   and   to  find  what   I  enjoy  in  each particular moment about  its shape,  its weight, how  it behaves under gravity, its solidity, its  materiality, its  inherent movement vocabulary, its  proportion and relatedness  to  my   body.   Constructing  a  phrase  of  these   micro-movements between door-on-corner-point,  door-on-edge  and  supporting hand becomes   a poetic  composition in real-time choreography and  a dialogue between physical
body,  spatial-body, architectural body,  object, architectural elements and gravity.
