A  vast  opening of  the  field  of  awareness that  is  simultaneously outside and inside  my  body,  initiates a sense  that  my  entire  self is a sense  organ,  a porous membrane through which  placements and  movements of the  environment are received or imprinted or, through the  act of noticing, sited.  Could  it be that  the environment lands  on sites  that  exist within one’s realm  of perception, that  the landing  is  a  cognitive  process,   that   landing  sites   exist   in   the   brain?   But considering that  the body’s nervous system  as a whole  is a receiving device,  and that  the status of information is being  fed by shifting, changing external factors, the perceived self could  be considered a constantly morphing entity  that includes the  body,  the  space,  the  environment, all in a continuous state  of configuration and reconfiguration.
