In the same performance, on a much  smaller scale of action,  Keane and  I animate gold  leaf,  blowing it with  hand-held paddles or  with  our  own  breath. It takes only the slightest puff for these  super-fine membranes to float with  a freedom of movement that  extends the  tentative into  the  unpredictable. We can  call these actions   procedural  tools   as  “a  procedural  tool   examines  and   reorders  the sensorium”  (2002:  30).  The  performance  environment  becomes   “a  tactically posed  surround  (which)   fills  an   organism  that   persons  with   questions  by enabling  it  to  move   within  and   between  its  own   modes  of  sensing”  (58). Questions such  as: What  direction will they  take off in? How  high  will they  fly? Will another unseen air pocket  nab them  off on a tangent? On what  or whom will they stick? When will they land?
