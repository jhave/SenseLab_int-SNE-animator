To  sum  up,  states  of  awareness found through  mind-body practices such  as meditation, performance and  movement-based improvisation have  put  me  in touch   with  a  web  of  connections my  body  holds   in  relation to  environment, bringing landing sites into focus. Through applying mechanisms of awareness in performative action,  I have  found increased access  to  creative responses, the ability  to connect  in present moment to the relationship of internal processes and external surround, enhanced presence and  a sited  awareness of “the  embodied texture of the  self and  its weave  into  the  world” (Ednie-Brown 2009). Looking directly at details  in my environment while  maintaining awareness of sensation within my body  affords  a framework to responsively play with, an embedded-in- self surroundscape through which  to dance,  and a way of breathing the walls.
