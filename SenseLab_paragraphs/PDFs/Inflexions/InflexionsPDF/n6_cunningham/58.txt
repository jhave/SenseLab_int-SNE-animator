Opposite the  scale  of vibration, a sensation equally worthy of a “simple taking note  of,” is pain.  I have  a lot of experience managing pain  in my  body  (mostly neurological pain  resulting from  nerve  damage in my left shoulder). The mind’s first and  natural response to pain  is aversion: trying to “run” from pain,  avoid  it, writhe, or wriggle free. Being able to simply be with  it, to sit with  it, to look at it, and  experience it for what  it is, takes  practice, awareness and  the decision to do so.  This  mental act  alone  reduces the  hurt  of pain  by  half,  but  also  forces the body-mind to be still. From  this  stillness things can  be perceived more  clearly, objectively.
