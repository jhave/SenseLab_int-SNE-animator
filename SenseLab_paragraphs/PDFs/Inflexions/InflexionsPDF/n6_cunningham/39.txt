There  happened a  moment while   performing Tuning  Fork:  Shopfront,  when  I found myself in a doubled-over position leaning against the plate-glass windows of the Judith  Wright Centre of Contemporary Arts  Shopfront space  that  face the street,  in such  a way  that  I could  remain there  for some  time,  looking  upside- down out  along  the footpath. I was  observing the feet of passers-by walking. At first, naturally, what  I saw looked upside-down. Nothing unusual. But after some time  my perception flipped, and  I suddenly saw  the movement in a completely different way.  Now  what  I was  looking  at  seemed like  a right-side up  image, with  the  footpath at  the  top,  the  awnings of  the  shops  at  the  bottom and  in between the  legs of the  passers-by reaching up  to touch  the  ground. This fresh perspective gave  me access  to a rare  reading through which  I could  see clearly the difference in quality and  timing between the first half of each step  when  the foot  is  moving away  from  the  ground, and  the  second half  when the  foot  is moving towards the ground. I could  see the way bodies  act in relation to gravity. It was strange and fascinating, as if I was seeing walking for the first time.
