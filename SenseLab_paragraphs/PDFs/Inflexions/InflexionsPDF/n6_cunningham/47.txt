the  formless. Attaching a grappling hook  of a perceptual landing site to a vaguely sketched-in rope  of an imaging landing site, a dimensionalizing landing site,  in  landing, hooks  onto  the environment  to   gain   traction  on   it.   With   the   hook-and-rope ensemble flung  out  and  an  availing surface  caught hold  of, there comes  to be an as-if-tugging-back-to-the-body that  conveys a sense of (kinesthetic) depth.
