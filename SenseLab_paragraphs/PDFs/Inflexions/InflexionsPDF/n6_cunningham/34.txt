The movement of gold  leaf allows  us to “see”  the  very  air itself; its volume, its relative weight and  density, and  its movement through temperature zones,  made apparent, for example, when a single  sheet  of gold  leaf swoops to spiral  through the slipstream of air around a body,  which  is slightly  warmer than  the air in the room.   And,   like  Gins  and   Arakawa’s proposed  architectural procedures,  the Tuning  Fork actions,  “always invented/reinvented  on  the  spot,  (…) exist  in the tense  of the iffy. Not  a fixed set of called-for actions,  (they  are) a spatiotemporal collaboration between a moving body  and  a tactically  posed surround” (2002:
73).
