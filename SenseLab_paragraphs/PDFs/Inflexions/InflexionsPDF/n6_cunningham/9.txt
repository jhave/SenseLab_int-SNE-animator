Vipassana meditation, as taught by S. N. Goenka, has  also  had  an influence on my life and practice, since 2005. The word vipassana means  â€œto see things as they really   are"  (Vipassana  Meditation  Website   2010).  As  a  practice,  it  involves observing sensations occurring throughout the body  with  an equanimous mind, neither craving pleasant sensations nor averting unpleasant ones.
