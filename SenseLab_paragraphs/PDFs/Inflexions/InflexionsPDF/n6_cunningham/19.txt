In  Tuning  Fork:  Shopfront,  an  installation performance created and  performed with  Jondi  Keane  in 2008, I hold  myself  in various positions in relation to the architecture,  allowing  my   body   to   find   its   own   logic   in   negotiating  the bodycontact-architecturalsurface-gravity interface, or I negotiate a spatial relationship  between  myself   and   a  particular  architectural  feature  from   a distance using  internal proximity and  orientation sensors, and  vision.  Holding for a time  these  unconventional orientations builds a resonance that  makes  the configuration more  apparent. This resonance imbues the body-environment configuration with  a sited-ness. Like “ordinary affects,”  these  configurations are
