If dance  is a series of creative advances, it is also in these examples a question of sustaining the conditioning potential within which  decisions are made.  What I call working backwards is the task of learning about  that which  conditions in the context  of dancing. While all there is is the dancing, the dancing is more than  all there  is. It’s also what  might  have been and what  might  be. What’s given  might not have been given  but also, what’s  not given  might  have been given (Whitehead, 1960: 70). This blurring of boundary in the context  of the boundary, is a question of attenuation aimed towards intensification, not the intensification of addition (adversion) nor that of contrast (aversion) but the intensification of
the experience of potentiality in those  droplets of experience we call dancing. [22]
