[17] This isn’t simply because of the preparations linked to pirouettes, tours  à la seconde, tours  en attitude, tours  en l’air, pas ballonné and the like (see Lincoln Kirstein,  Muriel  Stuart  and  Carlus  Dyer, 1977).  It also follows the fact of ballet’s fixed lexicon.  Of course,  timing can be and is attenuated, and  all dancers deal with  the vicissitudes of the moment, but the codification of ballet has been finessed over centuries. It is assisted by visual  forms of representation that govern the look of movement, as well as a series of fixed directions which undergird the dancer’s sense of orientation. See Gabrielle Brandstetter (2005: 67-
79).  The fact that the legibility of ballet came to be oriented to the front
(according to the proscenium arch of the Paris Opera house  and its subsequent avatars) cuts back on Dumas’ notion of the circularity of movement. See Marvin Carlson (1989). Theatres ‘in the round’, such as the Balinese ceremonial
courtyard or family  compound, cannot  avail themselves of the unilateral location
of the observer-artist implied by perspectival forms of drawing.
