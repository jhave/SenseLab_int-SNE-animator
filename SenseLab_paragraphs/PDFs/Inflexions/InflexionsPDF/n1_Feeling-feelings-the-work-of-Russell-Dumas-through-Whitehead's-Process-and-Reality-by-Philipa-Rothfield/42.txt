Whitehead uses the notion  of attenuation as an alternative to (subjective) intensification. There is a sense in which  attenuation, as the delay of selection, achieves an intensification all of its own. This mode  of intensification concerns a set of relations between potentiality and actuality which  arise in a movement’s concrete  “history of production” (Whitehead, 1960: 13). By potentiality, I mean a sphere of complex eternal objects as they relate  to the emerging physicality of movement. The delay  of selection  (decision) could  also be seen as the play of satisfaction, as a play with (unrealized) satisfaction. [16] The pirouette in ballet has what  is called a preparation. While the preparation will differ each time it’s enacted, it will be ‘read’ as the precursor to a pirouette. Its recognizable character (it is a set move  in itself) suggests a certain  inevitability with  respect to that which  follows.  Virtuosity in ballet is expressed in the dancer’s ‘mastery’ of these actions.   From her smile, to the muscular assertion of recognizable poses (visually coded),  the ballet dancers’ skill evokes  a sense of control.  This is assisted by the stability of a centred torso (shoulders over hips, spine erect) whose predetermined order facilitates the legibility of the limbs as they achieve spectacular heights.
