disjunction and conjunction is that movement is uncoupled from its original (and naturalized) context,  and reinserted into a new setting. The subsequent order of the work  creates  movement almost totally  unlike  its original character. But, and here a kind  of divine order and  relevance prevails, the aura  of the originary context  ought be kept alive. From a dancer’s point  of view, Sally Gardner has suggested that something of the prior  context needs  to be retained as the field of potentiality wherein decisions are made.  [21] Otherwise, the new assemblage becomes  reduced to a new movement norm  (an inevitability with  only one solution) and it loses that richness of transplanted indeterminacy. It is all too
easy for the dancer to ‘normalize’ movement (make  its inevitability a familiar expectation, an element of movement-superjectivity) and to thereby close off its wealth of potential. Keeping potentiality alive through a disjunctive multiplicity of traces is a matter of thinking in movement. It may be governed by God, but its execution is very much  up to the actual  occasion.  Strategies such as Tharp’s  Zs and  Dumas’  ‘jump cuts’ ask dancers to work with  two related fields — the conditioning implicit  in the notion of relevant, proximate order, and the
‘autonomous mastery’ of decision making – the causa sui of the creative advance.
