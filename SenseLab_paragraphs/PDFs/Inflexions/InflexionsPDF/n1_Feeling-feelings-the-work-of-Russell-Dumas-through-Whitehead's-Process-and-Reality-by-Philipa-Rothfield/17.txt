Subjectivity falls into this camp.  Subjectivity is the interior perspective of an emergent process. It may be simple  or complex. Subjectivity doesn’t  endure. [7] It is completed with  the completion of the process,  with its satisfaction. There is no subject who ‘has’ drops of experience. The formation of the drop constitutes the subjective point  of view, its ‘bite’ of the real. Subjectivity is intrinsically related to feeling. It is created through the passage of feelings in the process of feeling. [8] The subject is produced by the activity  and agency  of feeling — via the feeling’s
‘appropriation’ of elements in the universe — along  with  the feeling’s reaching
out towards newness. Since feelings  are vectorial, rather than  there being a subject (pre-given) which  ‘has’ feelings,  the feelings  themselves (thought singly or together) constitute the subjectivity of the process,  its ‘real internal constitution’.
