In a Whiteheadean sense, ‘felt sensation’ is inconsistent with  too much  tension in the body.  Too much  muscularity (tension in the legs, rigidity in the spine  or muscular holding patterns in the body)  stands in the way of a body feeling the dance  of gravity. In short,  muscularity operates at the expense of felt sensation in movement. Although Dumas addresses the dancer’s sense of feeling, it could  be said that the incompatibility pertains to the field of relational feelings  — of feelings feeling other  feelings — and  that tense muscles ‘interfere’ with  nuanced sensations at the level of the feelings  themselves.  The dancer enters  the mix at a latter  stage, as a secondary formation or superject predicated upon the play of process. The ‘constructive rest position’ involves lying down flat on the back with bent legs, and allowing the muscles to soften,  without needing to use the muscles that typically hold  the body  erect. In constructive rest, it becomes possible to allow  the muscles to soften,  to feel the play of gravity through the legs, often with the help of imagery (as a ‘lure for feeling’). After a while, it can become  possible to feel the sensations associated with the relations between gravity and the limbs, including for example the feel of fall of the femur  bone
into the hip socket. The femur  can be felt to ‘fall’ into the hip socket because the
legs are bent and  the weight of the legs falls down towards the hip socket. Even so, it takes a tie around the knees to encourage the legs to let go of their usual muscular holding and the imaginative lure of imagery such as; “imagine a clothes hanger holding up the knees, and the legs hang  down either  side of the hanger like a pair of slacks”. The aim of this vignette is to depict the process by which muscularity gives way to felt sensation.
