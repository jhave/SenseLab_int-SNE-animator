The definite ingression into a particular actual  entity  is not to be conceived as the sheer evocation of that eternal object from ‘not-being’  to ‘being’; it is the evocation of determination out of indetermination. Potentiality becomes reality;  and  yet retains its message of alternatives which  the actual entity  has avoided (Whitehead, 1960: 226).
