Meantime, the dancing continues, unperturbed. Looking  for improvement I ask questions: a ‘physical  question’ I say. Then I realize  all of my questions are in a sense physical, whether they are played out here on the page,  articulated as conceptual problems in the studio or directed to the minutiae of activities inherent in a so-called  move.  This is an endless process. I am still working out what  that process  is.
