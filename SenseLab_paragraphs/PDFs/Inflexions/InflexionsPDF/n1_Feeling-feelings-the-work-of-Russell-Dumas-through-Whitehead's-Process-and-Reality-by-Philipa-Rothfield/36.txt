Avoidance is the flip side of incorporation. What the 3 categoreal obligations imply is an understanding of the concrete texture and particularity of dancing, its specificity, but also the sense in which  one manner of dancing eliminates others. Elimination is an active and important element in the process of dancing. Actualization of some qualities precludes the incorporation of others. And yet, those  eliminated potential feelings have a certain  neighborly relation to that which is actualized in the dancing. The continuation of muscular holding
patterns is all that stands in the way of the myriad felt sensations of gravity.
Habit,  tendency and disposition may create a certain  propensity for elimination. The sensations of gravity are filtered through the ‘mediation’ of intervening processes. But they are nevertheless potentially felt. What it takes to convert these potentials to actuality is the work  of making a body ‘available’ in Dumas’ terms. It’s the task of converting one world to another. [15]
