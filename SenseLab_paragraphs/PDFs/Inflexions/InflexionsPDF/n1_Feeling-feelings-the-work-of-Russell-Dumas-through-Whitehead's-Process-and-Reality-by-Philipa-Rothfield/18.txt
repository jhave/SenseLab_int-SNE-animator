The vectorial movement of feelings  effects a shift, towards the constitution of the new.  The element of the old in the constitution of the new subject is that which  is felt, that which  feels its way into a new subjectivity. It is that ‘little piece of the real’ which  is appropriated and  taken  into the future by the movement of feeling in ‘the process  of the feeling.’ According to Whitehead, even the simplest of physical feelings  involves a relation between what  I’m calling the old and the
new (Whitehead, 1960: 361). In the process of becoming according to which  a
new entity  arises, a feeling in one entity  (the soon-to-be old one) extends into an emerging new one. Donald Sherburne writes  that the new entity ‘reaches out’ to include aspects of the old entity  in itself  (Sherburne, 1966: 10). This is the
‘appropriation’ of which  Whitehead writes.  In appropriating ‘elements of the universe’, the old feeling is now selected  by a new subjectivity. In Sherburne’s terms,  the passage of feeling “bears  the A-ness of A into B” (1966: 10). This selection  process represents the way in which  the old features in the new. It’s not that all aspects  of the old entity  are merely  repeated, some may be (via feeling) while some may not be (they are eliminated via negative prehension).
