Whitehead writes  of a certain  kind  of repetition in the carriage of the old into the new, whereby the old becomes  objectified  relative to a new subjectivity of process. Something prior  was utilized by my dancing so as to create something new; the feeling of (a new) feeling, which  constituted a new manner of dancing. The objectified  old functions in a causal manner to produce the new which  is a mode  of reenactment of what  is now an old feeling. But, and this must  be said all at once, old feelings  are felt under an abstraction, via subjectivity’s perspective, via its selection of the old. Reenactment is never  mere reenactment. [9] Certain old feelings (in my example of not-feeling) caused a new feeling (that thickness of
feeling). So, in a sense, the components were there — it was always open  to me to
feel that inner  thickness. These ‘elements of the universe’ were available. But I didn’t avail myself of them  until  the feelings  moved from one state (initial datum/data) to another (objective datum/data). This passage is (or, by now,
was) active.  It represents the agency  inherent in the shift from my not feeling my torso to feeling it. If there  was a sense of emergent authorship in my dancing, it is due  to that agency,  otherwise called ‘appropriation’.
