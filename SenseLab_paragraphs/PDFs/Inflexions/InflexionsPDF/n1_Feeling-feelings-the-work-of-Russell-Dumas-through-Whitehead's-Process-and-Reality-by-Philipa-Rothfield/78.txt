[5] My lived  sense of it was that something new was happening in my dancing and I could  feel it.  The feeling I felt seemed a secondary experience — consequent upon the corporeal activity.  The distinction between the activity  of the dancing as the source  of the emergent feelings  and my agency  as the source
moves  this account out of the zone of embodied agency  into one which  attributes
agency  to the process itself, to the process of the dancing as the source  and  site of emergent feeling. It’s not that I cannot thereby access these feelings.   It is rather that the process  itself creates  something which  I am, as a consequence, able to feel. Similarly,  the process of elimination is also a feature of the process itself (the dancing), rather than  a subjective act carried out by me.  It’s not that I don’t do it (produce the eliminations), it is rather that the eliminated feelings (negative prehensions) don’t do me. (Thanks to Erin Manning for this latter  form of
words).
