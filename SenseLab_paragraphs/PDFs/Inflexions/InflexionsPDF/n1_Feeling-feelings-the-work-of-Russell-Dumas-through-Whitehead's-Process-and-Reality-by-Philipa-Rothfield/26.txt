While dancing relentlessly pursues the creation of novelty, via the forward thrust of actualization, the process  of emergent newness is a complex play between the gravitational pull of givenness (the conditioning aspect  of objectivity) and  the
lure towards new feeling. If that lure is not completely unfettered, it is nevertheless alive with  potential indetermination. The play between the two is how I like to think  of dance.  By analyzing the ‘phases  of concrescence’ through the formation of subjectivity, into the ‘objective immortality’ of a fresh past, Whitehead attempts to account for the debt actualization owes the past as it participates in the creation of novelty. There are a number of terms  whose complex  articulation suggests the concrete  sense in which  the past both grounds and  enables  the future. [11] But perhaps we might  pay homage to the Humean lineage  in Whitehead’s work,  and work  through a few physical vignettes as we turn  to the conceptual. [12]
