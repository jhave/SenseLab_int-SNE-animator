[12] David  Hume writes:  “That all our simple  ideas in their first appearance, are derived from simple  impressions, which  are correspondent to them,  and which they exactly represent… An impression first strikes  upon the senses,  and  makes us perceive heat or cold, thirst  or hunger, pleasure or pain,  of some kind  or other. Of this impression there is a copy taken  by the mind, which  remains after the impression ceases; and  this we call an idea” (Hume, 1974: 13-17).  See also Whitehead (1960: 379).
