Whitehead’s Process and Reality posits  events  or occasions as the most basic entities in the world. Entities  are emergent, dynamic processes. Reality emerges through these processes, in fits and starts,  via what’s  called ‘drops of experience’, recalling the Jamesian notion that perception “grows literally by buds  or drops” (Whitehead, 1960: 105). What’s distinctive about  this account is that processes become  the drops. Being emerges from becoming which  in turn  emerges from being. The ‘ing’-ness of process retains a dynamic character which  comes to fruition at the formation of the ‘drop’, via what  Whitehead calls satisfaction. Although processes happen altogether (they cannot be timed and  therefore broken down into temporal components), they can be philosophically analyzed into their constituent aspects.
