According to Alfred  North Whitehead, the world is the kind  of place where new things happen. Newness comes from oldness, then sinks back into the landscape of the old. [1] New things generate newer things, thereby becoming old. There is a kind  of rhythm to this perpetual oscillation between emergent newness and ongoing establishment. The rhythmic shift between old and new is not merely the relentless pursuit of the new. The process of becoming past also enters  that which  becomes,  connecting with the process of becoming itself.  In that sense, a certain  reverence is maintained for the old.  It partners the agency  of the new via that which  is called the creative advance.
