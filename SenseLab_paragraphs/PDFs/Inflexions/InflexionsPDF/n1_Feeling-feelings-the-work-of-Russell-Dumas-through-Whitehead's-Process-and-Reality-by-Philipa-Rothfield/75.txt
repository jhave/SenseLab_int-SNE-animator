[2] “A simple  physical feeling enjoys a characteristic which  has been variously described as ‘re-enaction,’ ‘reproduction,’ and ‘conformation.’  This characteristic can be more accurately explained in terms  of the eternal objects involved. There are eternal objects determinant of the objective datum which  is the ‘cause,’ and eternal objects determinant of the definiteness of the subjective form belonging to the ‘effect.’  When there  is re-enaction there  is one eternal object with  two-way functioning, namely, as partial determinant of the objective datum, and  as partial determinant of the subjective form”  (Whitehead,1960: 364).  Conformal feelings more  generally exhibit  this character of re-enactment.
