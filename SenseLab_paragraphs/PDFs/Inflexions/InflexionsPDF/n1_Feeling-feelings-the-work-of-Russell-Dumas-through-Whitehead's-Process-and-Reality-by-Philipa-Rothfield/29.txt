Whitehead’s notion of the categoreal obligations as applied to conformal feelings sheds  light on an important element of Dumas’  work  and  on the specificity of dancing more generally. The categoreal obligations ensure that the actual  world of a given entity  is consistent, that subjective unity  is achieved, objective identity preserved and  objective diversity allowed for (Whitehead, 1960: 39).
Incompatible qualities cannot inhere in the one danced movement. Thus the
feelings that come together work  positively, to offer a unity  of felt qualities but also negatively, to exclude that which  cannot be incorporated within the one process. While there  are many  possible timbres of bodily  feeling, the composite actuality of dancing will only select those  timbres which  are “harmoniously compatible” and capable of enjoying “mutual sensitivity” (1960: 362, 338). [14] This pertains to what  can be felt according to a particular style and  manner of dancing and  what  cannot.
