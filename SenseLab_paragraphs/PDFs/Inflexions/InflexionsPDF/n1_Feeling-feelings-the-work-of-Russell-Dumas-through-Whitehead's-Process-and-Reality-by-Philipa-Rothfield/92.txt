The creature perishes and is immortal… This conception of an actual entity  in the fluent  world is little more  than  an expansion of a sentence in the Timaeus: ‘But that which  is conceived by opinion with  the help of sensation and without reason, is always in the process  of becoming and  perishing and  never really is’ ” (Whitehead, 1960: 126).
