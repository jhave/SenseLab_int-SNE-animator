As such, Massumi wants us to open our eyes to an abstract movement of the aesthetic event, one that requires a seeing with and through actual form. Form is understood here as the apparition of potential in present experience, a doubled vision of both the object and a lived relation: “The potential we see in the object is a way our body has of being able to relate to the part of the world
it happens to find itself in at this particular life’s moment”. To see in this way is not just to see an object but an event, which is fully real movement, in the sense that the virtual is fully real, because “something has happened: the body has been capacitated. It’s been relationally activated.”
