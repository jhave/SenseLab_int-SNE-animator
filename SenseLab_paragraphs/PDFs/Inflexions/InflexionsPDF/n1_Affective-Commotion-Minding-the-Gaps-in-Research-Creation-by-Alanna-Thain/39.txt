In “The Thinking-Feeling of What Happens: A Semblance of a Conversation”, Brian Massumi stretches the shadow of a previous interview with Arjen Mulder, subjecting Mulder to a kind of possession in a critique of interactive art and in an argument for a different conception of “dynamic form”. This curious format foregrounds an issue central to the practice of research- creation—the way in which it calls into question subjective boundaries by making individuals themselves zones of resonance. In critiquing a certain “tyranny” of interactivity as all too often remaining within the action-reaction circuit, Massumi lays out a series of claims around an alternative mode of understanding the relationality of art, what he terms a “speculative pragmatism”, a technique of experience that expands perception to engage a double vision capable of perceiving what he terms “vitality affect”. Drawing on Susanne Langer’s concept of “semblance”, described as a “place-holder in present perception of a potential ‘more’ to life”, or a “living in potential”, Massumi considers the question of how dynamic form as semblance appears in art. Like Murphie, Massumi argues for the ‘everydayness’ of relationality ‘in its own right’, but wants to make a claim for the value of the aesthetic, and especially for the idea of form at a time when these ideas seem to have fallen out of favour, in order to understand precisely the value of such ‘useless’ experience that, as he describes it, can only be lived in, not lived out. Shifting the terms of debate so that the term up for valuation in ‘interactive art’ is art itself, Massumi argues for the uselessness of art as precisely that which allows potential to be felt. The contemporary moment demands that we “need right now to revisit the aesthetic in relation to interactive art”, to understand what art does, what it makes appear. One such thing is that:
