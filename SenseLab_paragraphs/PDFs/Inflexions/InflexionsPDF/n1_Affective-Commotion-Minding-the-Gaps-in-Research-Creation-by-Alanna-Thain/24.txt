‘cognitive turn’. A technic is a mode of attentive engagement with the inbetween, an awareness of the creativity of ‘worlding’, a term he borrows from Massumi. Another way to describe a technic is as the “differential repetition involved in relationality”.  The kind of research-creation that we want, Murphie argues, is one that seeks to “to create the new with awareness that this is what we are doing”. This awareness, he claims, is what “makes all the difference in the world”. Attention and awareness characterize the form of agency that Murphie argues for, a research into how participation occurs, where agency is not the autonomous action of a subject but a mode of participation that produces becomings. As such, Murphie explores experiments in thinking
‘with’ throughout this paper, from his participation in events such as Housing the Body or the Assemblage for Collective Thought (with Anna Munster), through a variable series of encounters with dogs, from his own dog Tommy, through Pavlov and Kant.  Murphie draws on these experiences, even when the encounter is simply a dog wandering through an open room at an academic workshop, to explore what happens when the boundaries of what constitutes a field of inquiry are made sensible to an inflexion of directed attention.
