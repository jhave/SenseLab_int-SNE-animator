This double vision of aesthetic experience is an opening to relationality via technique:  “when you’re getting there technically, I think it’s because you’ve shifted the emphasis from interaction to lived relation, and are starting to find ways of operating on the qualitative level of thinking- feeling, where you are pooling styles of being and becoming, not just eliciting behaviors”. These are what Manning and Massumi call  “techniques of relation”, techniques that seek to expand potential via the virtual. As Massumi critically argues: “it is only because relation is virtual that there is any freedom or creativity in the world”.
