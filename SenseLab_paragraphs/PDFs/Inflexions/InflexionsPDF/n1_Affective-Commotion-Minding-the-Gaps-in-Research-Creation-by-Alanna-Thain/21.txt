2007)—sought to develop techniques that provoked and made sensational a “movement of thought”. As Manning describes this: “Thought in motion is a creative proposition for thought at work”. These events were attempts to activate the virtual, practical séances that explored the pressures of enabling constraints as that which forces creativity to emerge as a line of flight. In some ways, they can be imagined as “unthought experiments”, methods for thinking-feeling the virtual.  A central concern in these events was precisely this question not only of “after the event sense”, or a recognition, but how to practically continue the work of research-creation, or what Manning calls “making multiple sense”. Inflexions is part of the attempt to imagine the experience of these discrete events as acts of ongoing transformation. The essays that follow are themselves attempts at research-creation, activating the sense of essays not as objects but as images of thought, themselves eventful—as essaying, or trying, an activity that always contains within itself the (productive) possibility of failure.
