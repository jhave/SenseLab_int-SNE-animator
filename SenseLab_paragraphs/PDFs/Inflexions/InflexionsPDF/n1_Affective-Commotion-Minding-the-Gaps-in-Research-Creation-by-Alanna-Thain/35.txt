“body-mind event of an idea”. This “meta-stability” is the creative action of the fold, explored here in the light of Deleuze’s reading of Leibniz and seeking to understand the parallel elasticity of matter and thought. For Portanova, dance, here in the form of Nora Heilmann’s Blindspot, is mode of folding that shows the “impossibility of separation between movement and thought”: a balanced form of expression. By balance, Portanova is not describing stasis, but borrowing a term from Manning, the ‘pre-acceleration’ of a qualitative movement that makes sensational those micro-movements that usually go unnoticed. To understand this balance, Portanova draws on Deleuze and Guattari to understand creation as a compositional possibility, a mode of balancing that allows for an autonomy of creation as a kind of becoming- environment. For instance, to stand on one leg, the best way to stay in what only “appears” as a static pose is not to
concentrate on rigidifying the body, but to expand relation such that the floor, gravity and the air around you become part of the compositional effort. The effort or thought of relation is thus, as Portanova reminds us, “always of a collective nature”. Like Manning, Portanova is less interested in creation as the work of a individual and more of a “becoming-environment”: “When you
think, you not only collaborate with other subjects and with the different temporal instances of
