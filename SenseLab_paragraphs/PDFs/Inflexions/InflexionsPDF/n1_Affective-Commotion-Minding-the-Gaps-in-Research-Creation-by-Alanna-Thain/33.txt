the forms of sense that the body makes? Moving away from the question of “what” is research- creation towards that of the how, McCormack calls attention to where “the balance between thinking and research shifts from explaining the nature – or the ‘what’ – of experience, but to the process of ‘experiencing, the method of its course, the how of its changes’(Dewey, 1958, 235)”. The attention to somatic techniques involve that sense that constraint is in fact “enabling”, that affective openness involves a training in relationality, an attention to what we are already doing. This is the awareness that Murphie calls for, that which ‘makes (a) difference’.
