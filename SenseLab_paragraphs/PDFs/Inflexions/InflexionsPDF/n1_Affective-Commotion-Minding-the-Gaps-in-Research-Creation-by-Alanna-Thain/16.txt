is always a creative re-discovery, a future anterior, a sensational tactic, a reversal of the inflexion where experience slides into utility and functional perception. According to our modest proposal, research-creation should be understood as a method of intuition, a technique for expanding perception that puts it into immediate contact with sensation, in what Brian Massumi here calls the “thinking-feeling of what happens”. An expansion of perception brings us into “affective co-motion”: by opening us to more possibilities for being affected, we increase our own power to affect in return.
