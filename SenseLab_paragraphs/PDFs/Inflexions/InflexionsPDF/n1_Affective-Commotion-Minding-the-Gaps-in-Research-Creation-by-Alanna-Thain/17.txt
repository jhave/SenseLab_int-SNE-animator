As part of our work, Inflexions seeks to engage in what Deleuze and Guattari call the “modest task of a pedagogy of the concept, which would have to analyze the conditions of creation as factors of always singular moments”.5   As Murphie notes, cloning technics is one such practice— in making technics available for other attempts, what is made apparent is the ‘differential repetition’ produced—a singularity. The question of research-creation does not seek to understand how these modes relate to each other, but instead to operate in the “reality of the excluded middle”, to linger in the indiscreet gap between them, to make resonant and mobile the eventness of their sensible connection. Research-creation explores becoming, which more than any object is what art is, is what concepts do—it puts the movement back into thought.  Another word for becoming is ‘relational potential’, what Erin Manning describes in her essay as “encounters with emergent environments from which relations or articulations are born”. A critical example of such an environment is the body itself. The body as the “locus of research-
creation” is a recurrent theme in these essays, its creative potential understood as the double becoming of affecting and being affected.
