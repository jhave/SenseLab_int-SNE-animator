because they involve a ‘doing with’, the suggestive force of the how that seeks to produce the now—the experience of a singularity that “makes all the difference in the world”. Technics are the “enabling constraints” of research-creation in their very immanence, a standardization of repetition in terms of experience (try this!) in order to become aware that in the attempt we are changing them. Only in this way, Murphie argues, do we participate fully in the mobility of thought, rather than a mobilization of thought, getting away from what Avital Ronell calls “the test drive” mode of experimentation which seeks utility and preterritorialized outcomes into a mode of experimentation that recognizes there is no testing that is not already fully part of the creation of the world.
