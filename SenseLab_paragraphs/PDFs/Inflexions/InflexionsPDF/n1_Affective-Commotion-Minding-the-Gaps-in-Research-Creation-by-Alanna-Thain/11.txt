often obscured by a retroactive distancing between mind/ body, self/ other, subject/ object, artist/ artwork, discovery/ invention. In making the subject of our first issue “How is Research- Creation?” we at Inflexions not only want to call attention to the already creative work of writing, thinking and producing concepts, but at the same time, reactivate the rigorous mystery of research as what Deleuze terms a ‘dark precursor’ rather than simply a searchlight in an archive, to imagine the synthetic work of research as making space for the new.2 Research implies an attentive posture, an openness to what is already happening, an expanded perception of what we are already participating in. Priority falls not onto one term or another in the assemblage of
research-creation, but to the ‘creative inbetween’.
