Such virtual relations are what Inflexions as a journal seeks to evoke and produce.  The title of this journal, tweaked from the work of Bernard Cache and Gilles Deleuze, comes from the moment of sensible changing, prior to a determined destination, a ‘transformative tendency’, the moment of what Manning calls “preacceleration’ or how “movement can be felt before it actualizes”. 6 The essays in this first issue seek to activate and extend that moment of uncertainty and potential to explore the creativeness of the inbetween. In an interview, Cache describes inflection as between “chaos and modulation”, fundamentally concerned with the potential emergence of new qualities.7 Inflection is also a form of the gaze, one attuned to the movement of modulation.  A journal of research-creation, Inflexions shares this goal of generating doubled visions of the world that may produce a vertiginous giddiness and may also induce contagious mutations.
