We can find  the enhancement of the dimension in chaotic  movement in rain,  for example, dropping as  non-regular and  non-periodical. Chaos  theory is deterministic,  because it is mathematically formulated, however, the action  born of chaotic behavior resists  calculation. Determinism draws a picture of a world in which  everything is predicted and  extrapolated to the  last,  but  again,  in chaos theory, prediction is futile. These two situations seem paradoxical at a glance.
