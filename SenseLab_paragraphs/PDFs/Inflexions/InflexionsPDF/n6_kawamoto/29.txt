An   autopoietic  machine  organized  (defined  as   a  unity)   as   a network  of  processes  of  production (transformation and destruction) of components that  produces the  components which: (1) through their  interactions and  transformations continuously regenerate and  realize  the network of processes (relations) that produced them;  and  (2) constitute it  (the  machine) as  a concrete unity   in   the   space   in   which   they   (the   components)  exist   by specifying to  the  topological domain of  its  realization as  such  a network.(Maturana and Varela 1980: 78-79)
