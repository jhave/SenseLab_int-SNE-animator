To formulate the self is to occupy  the place  one is in, and  to occupy  said place  is essential to the possibility of action  (such  as moving to another place,  etc.). If we were unable to occupy  a place, we would also be unable even to move  to another place.  The  situation in which  a person becomes  something is connected to the possibility  of  that   person’s  self-recognition,  and   occupation  of  a  place   is connected to the possibility of action.  To occupy  this place  is “the  landing site of action.”  If the  possibility of self-recognition and  the  possibility of one’s  actions were  the same  thing,  we would be unable to act in the world – the ‘landing site’ supports the possibility of action in the world.
