In  this  formulation,  there   are  at  least  four   modes  of  double  operation:  the formation of the  systems boundaries  through  continual processes; definition of components through continual processes; the formation of the ‘self of the system’ through  continual  processes;  and   the  formation  of  topological  space   of  the system  through continual processes (Kawamoto 2006).
