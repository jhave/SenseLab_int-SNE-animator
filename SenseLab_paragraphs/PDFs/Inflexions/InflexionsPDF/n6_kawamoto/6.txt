The first foothold Arakawa is concerned with  is the expansion of possibility. Although  ‘not  dying’  seems   to  us  rather  improbable, the  logical   possibility cannot  be denied. Not  only that,  but,  just as there  are many  types  of infinities, it is indicated that  there  are  also  many  types  of possibilities. Even  within such  a multitude of possibilities, expanding the possibility of ‘not dying’ would seem to lie at the very margins. If we view this expansion of possibilities as a dimensional extension,  Arakawa’s  expansion  and   Chaos   Mechanics  become   nearly synonymous.
