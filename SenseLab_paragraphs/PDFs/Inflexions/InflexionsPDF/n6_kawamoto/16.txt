The second theoretical foothold involves the  ‘landing site.’ The ‘landing site’ is an act of positioning, a basic activity  that  organizes the relationship between the world and  the self through the identification of a said position. Any type of quest for environmental information utilizes the ‘landing site.’ The act of position- specifying precedes the recognition of a specified position. The ‘landing site’ has the special  characteristic of simultaneously specifying something’s position while initiating the  organization of  the  relation between that  position and  the  self. These  two  movements, which  differ  qualitatively but  move  as one, I have  come to   call   “Double   Operation.”   From    this    standpoint,   Arakawa + Gins   and autopoiesis become  very similar  conceptions.
