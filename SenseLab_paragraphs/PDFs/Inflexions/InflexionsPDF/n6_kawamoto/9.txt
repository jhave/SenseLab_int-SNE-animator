understandings of our lives, history, the world, etc. would all change. The dimensions of reality’s possibilities are undefined. As such,  we ourselves should be able to set the  parameters that  allow  for the  expansion of human possibility. This  can  be  achieved through science,  art,  and  architecture. Instead of taking human reality  at face value,  under the  conventionally thought of range  of possibilities, we are to make  expanding human possibility itself the issue.  Thus,
‘not dying’ subsists in the setting  of the parameters, allowing for ‘the expansion of possibility.’
