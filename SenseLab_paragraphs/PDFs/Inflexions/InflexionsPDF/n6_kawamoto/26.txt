To  this  point,   the  concepts of  ‘being  in  the  world’  and   ‘existence’  are  born. Sometimes  it  is  said  that   “People  recognize  the  world while   existing   in  it.” However, the occupation of a place  in the world functions as the action  of using the landing site, as an active  ‘relating to the world.’ That  occupation operates at the same time as the cognitive perspective that is open  to the world. In both cases of ‘landing sites,’ occupying a place identifies the possibility of the action that accompanies recognition.
