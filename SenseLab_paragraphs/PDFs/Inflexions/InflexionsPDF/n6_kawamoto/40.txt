By creating spaces  that  take  into  consideration life’s movements, and  from  the point/perspective   of  formulating  personally  intrinsic  spaces,   da   Vinci   and Arakawa utilize  the  same  techniques. When  space  is thought of in non-integral dimensions, things that  we perceive appear as differentiated movements. Things which  have  been  formed according to this  differentiation of movement are  da Vinci’s  space.   This  is  to  say,  to  create   space   according  to  life’s  movements (Kawamoto  2007).  From   the   perspective  of  space   formation,  da   Vinci  and Arakawa are moving in the same direction.
