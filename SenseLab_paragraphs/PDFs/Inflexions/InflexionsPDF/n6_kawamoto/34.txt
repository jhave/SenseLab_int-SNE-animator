Things  which  act like life forms  (whether it be humans, animals, plants, etc.) not only specify  a place  – they  possess a physical body.  Where  there  is a gaze,  there must  be a body  from which  that  gaze originates. The body  itself moves,  and  thus also establishes its own  domain or region.  Rather  than  recognition or occupying a space,  a special  trait  of the  body  is that  it itself  moves.  In that  situation, the space that connects movement and  the position-specifying ‘landing site’ becomes insufficient. The ‘landing site’ occupies the position and  movement changes that position. But the  body  forms  its own  topological space.  It is then  necessary to introduce  a  fluid-state  space   in  which   mass   energy  can  flow  freely.  In  this situation, we must  set up a system  that  cultivates regionalization or classification of   the   environment.  This   is   where  ‘cleaving,’   or   cutting  and   closing,   is introduced.
