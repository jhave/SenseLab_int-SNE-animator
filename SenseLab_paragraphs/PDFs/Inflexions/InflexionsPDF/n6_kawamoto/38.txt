However, whether  or  not  such   construction  techniques  are  suitable  for  life activities is heavily  questionable. In geometrically assembling the  straight line, the plane,  and  the solid  body,  integral dimensions such  as the first, second, and third dimensions come into existence.  Yet there  is no guarantee that such integral dimensions are  compatible with  life. In the  mathematically deterministic techniques of chaos mechanics, the possibility of non-integral dimensions such as the  3, 12 dimension or  the  3, 24 dimension have  been  identified (Kaneko  and Tsuda  1996).
