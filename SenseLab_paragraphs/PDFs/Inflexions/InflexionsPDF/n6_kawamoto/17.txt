If we  only  had  to  know  the  positions of objects,  then  we  would only  need  to arrange them  on the coordinate axis. However, the act of specifying the location of  an  object  necessarily includes  organizing  the  relationship of  the  object  to oneself,   even   before   placing  it  on  its  coordinates.  The  intellectual  aspect   of relating to an  object  is an  act  of acknowledging its position. The  ‘landing  site’ itself  is not  the  concept  of recognizing; rather, it is the  concept  of the  action  of positioning.
