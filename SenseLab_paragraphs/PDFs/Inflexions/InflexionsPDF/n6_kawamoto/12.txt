All  chaotic   movements  are   presented  in  a  topological  space,   that   is,  in  a dimension defined by mathematics. Within  such movements, one movement suddenly  disappears  into   another  dimension.  Such   a  movement  cannot   be predicted  in  topological  space.   Chaotic   movement formulated  within deterministic mathematical operations contains the possibility for dimension enhancement. Ultimately, chaotic  movement includes actions  that  transcend the
