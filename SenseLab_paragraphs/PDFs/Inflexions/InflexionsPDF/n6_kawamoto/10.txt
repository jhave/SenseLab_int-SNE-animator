We can think  of the mathematical concept  of infinite  sets as a metaphor. Within infinite  sets,  there  are  countably infinite  sets  and  uncountably infinite  sets,  and within uncountably infinite  sets, there  are several  types  of infinite  sets yet â€“ the infinite  set of real  numbers, which  itself contains rational and  irrational infinite sets,  and  so on and  so forth.  Although all these  sets  are  infinite,  the  degrees of infinity  are different in each. In the same  way, the range  of possibility is not one- dimensional. We  ourselves can  reset  the  boundary  conditions such  that  this range  can  be expanded. This  is what  Arakawa + Gins  have  attempted through their architecture in the cities of Nagi, Youro, and Mitaka.
