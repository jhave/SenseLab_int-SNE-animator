The  action   in  which   recognition and   action   work   inseparably will  be  called cognitive action.  According to  this  principle, the  following situation is inconceivable. An observer, using  the ‘landing site’ as recognition of an object’s position, conducts quests for information according to that  recognition, and  uses what  s/he finds  to guide his/her actions.  This interpretation is impossible—only a robot would do such a thing.  The relationship between life forms and the world is firstly  a consequence of action.  The action  is already connected to the  world and  it is recognition that  gives  us hints  and  choices  for the  organization of that relationship.
