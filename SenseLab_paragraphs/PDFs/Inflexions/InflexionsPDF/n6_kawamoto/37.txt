In the  human case,  architecture is usually geometrically formulated. However, we   should  view   this   as   arising    from   special    circumstances  surrounding production. Humans have unfortunately picked out things that are too strong for construction. While carving a stick, we make  predictions like, “If I shave  it down a little more  here, it will be even straighter” in the production process.  However, physically, it’s nearly  impossible to make it completely straight. Nevertheless, we grasp the  concept   of  ‘straight.’  Taking  the  physical stick  as  an  example, the concept  of “the  straight line”  is born.  This  concept  can  be  called  an  idea,  and taking  these  ideas  and  putting them  into  formulas and  equations is ‘geometry.’ Thus, due  to what  we have learned in the construction process,  most architecture constructs with physical materials that match  this conceptual model.
