The third foothold concerns changing the structure of architecture such  that  the body’s possibilities are expanded. Most architecture follows  a plan  that  does  not allow  for  the  expansion of  possibilities (of  life,  the  body,   etc.).  However, in Arakawa’s architecture, this  is not  the  case; rather, architecture is a procedural device   to   expand  possibilities.  Life   forms   are   not   formulated  in   integral dimensions such  as the third or fourth dimensions; thus  the goal of architecture is to create  a space  appropriate for life and  the body,  a space  in which  one is free to consider expanding possibilities. In this way, Arakawa and  da Vinci are nearly the same.
