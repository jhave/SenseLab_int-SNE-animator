It   is   in   this   environment  that   Arakawa’s  architecture  makes    its   advent. Architecture appears  as  one  of  the  many   methods  of  formation  considered suitable for life’s actions,  and  is itself a form of life. An ant’s nest is as such, as is a bee hive, a snail’s shell, etc. Thus from the point  of this natural architecture, the buildings that  humans produce are  exceptions, for  they  are  not  built  to  draw forth   life’s  possibilities.  To  change  this  at  the  most   basic  level,  the  destiny- reversal house  stands.
