Cleaving provides the  basic  image  of this  fluid  formation of space,  a  type  of model  image.  Take,  for example, putting a finger  in a container of water. In a split  second, a division is created, but  in the next,  the water closes around your finger  and  the  division is closed.  Or, a swarm of gnats  on a riverbank after  the rain:  you  can split  the  group into  two  by cutting your  hand through it, but  the division is only  momentary. They  quickly  reform  as one  group. This  action  of simultaneously   creating  divisions  and    restoring   connections  is   ‘cleaving.’ Cleaving supports  the  articulation of  both  the  world and  the  distribution of landing sites.
