Most  of the  arguments of cognitive science,  even  in ecological  psychology, are mistaken. In such arguments, the relation with  the world is formulated first according to recognition, and  from  there,  gathered information guides the  next action.  Such an argument is like a person who  first learns  about  his relationship to the world from  a book,  and  using  the book  as guidance, cautiously plans  his behaviors. Or  it  can  be  likened to  a  person who,   while   looking   at  the  sea, practices swimming first  on land.  Even  though the  act of swimming is induced by  the  information  one  gets  from   looking   at  the  sea,  one  can  only  imitate swimming on the beach.  In this case, movement and  environmental information are interlocked. However, no one would likely call such  a thing  ‘swimming.’ He lacks  the  action  of specifying his position, and  all action  subsists in the  landing site, not in affordance (Kawamoto 2007).
