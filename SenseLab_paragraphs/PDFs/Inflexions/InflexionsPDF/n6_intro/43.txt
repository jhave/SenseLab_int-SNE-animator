[11] In Germany, the  rate  of increase  from
2000  to  2003  was   half   that   in  previous decades. In  New  Zealand, life  expectancy rose  by increasing amounts in each  decade between 1970 and  2000; but  in 2003, it was the same  as in 2000. Given  substantial advances in knowledge, e.g. mapping the human  genome, awareness of  genetic factors  in cancer,  it is clear  that  more knowledge does  not necessarily lead  to longer  lives.  Science  and  technology seem in fact more likely culprits contributing to mortality  as   they   underwrite  poor consumer practices and  increased exposure to toxins. It may be time for knowledge and thinking to evolve  beyond technoscience.
