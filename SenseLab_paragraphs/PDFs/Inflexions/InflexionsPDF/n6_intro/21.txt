Arakawa’s generosity took  the form  of a more  impersonal largess,  often  playing the role of trickster and  provocateur, speaking indirectly and  enigmatically or pointedly and  conclusively. He  was  given  to  giving  examples that  were  both extremely grounded  and  accessible  while  being  offered  in  the  form  of  a  Zen koan.  His personal strength, evident in the physicality of his movements as well as in the uncompromising agility  of his intellectual maneuvers, perhaps led him to  take  up  his  battle  inwardly. Perhaps, during  the  quick  progression of  his illness,  he  could  hear  the  snipes  of those  who  would only  see  his  illness  and death as the  come-uppance of a man  who  had  ‘decided not  to die’ rather than recognize the  intense liveliness of a person who  had  been  constantly deciding how to live, re-inventing himself  at every moment, even when dying.
