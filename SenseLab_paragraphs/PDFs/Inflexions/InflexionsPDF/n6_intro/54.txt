What  sense, however, does  “a share  in immortality”   make?    Immortality   seems more  like  pregnancy:  there  are  no  partial states. In the physicists’ terminology, immortality is not a continuous spectrum variable. Or is it? Is it qualitatively different from   indefinite  quantitative  extension  of life? Here AG perhaps agree with  the engineers. Unlike  a  divine who  is  in principle eternal, human immortals may instead be simply mortals that  go on indefinitely. Thus immortality would be, borrowing from  Aristotle on  infinity,   like the Olympic games;  experienced not as a single     event,     but    as    a    sequence   of successive events.  The  point  is not  not-to- die  once  and  for  all,  but  not  to  die  right now, here, in every instance.
