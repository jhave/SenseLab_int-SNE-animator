Woman that the philosophical tendency to immortality  is  a  phallic   project.   [18]  She reads  Plato’s cave analogy as a kind  of inverted  Oedipal  Complex:  the   father   is loved,   the  mother murdered.  Her  cave  is the  originary place,  the  womb.  In  making the  philosophical journey  outside the  cave to the realm of the forms, the philosopher leaves  behind the mother and  the natural order, that  is, mortality. Killing/ignoring gender enacts  a  phallic   logic  of  the  same that  marginalizes and  oppresses women. Indeed, historically woman has  been displaced and  disempowered by her failure to  measure  up  on  sticks  calibrated according to male criteria.  For example, Aristotle’s   woman   is    a    man    without enough body  heat  to turn  blood  to semen; Freud’s  is  a  castrated man.  Whitbeck further identifies “woman” historically as partial man;  the secondary, lesser  term  in a series  of  oppositions;  and  man’s  assistant and helpmate. [19]
