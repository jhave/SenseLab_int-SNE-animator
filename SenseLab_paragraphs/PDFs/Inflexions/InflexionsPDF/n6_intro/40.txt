million,  his Institute of Biomedical Gerontology will turn  his Strategies for Engineered  Negligible  Senescence   into reality.  [8] Futurologist Ray  Kurzweil and nutritionist Terry  Grossman recommend a “bridge  to  a  bridge”  strategy  using available technology to slow ageing  and  get to   subsequent  technologies  not   yet available. [9] Kurzweil takes 250 dietary supplements daily  and  weekly intravenous infusions  to  restore  cell  membranes. Genetic  tests determine his susceptibility to cancers  and the best therapies. He says nanotechnology is only 20 years  away  from replacing   the   digestive  tract    with    tiny robots  to provide direct  nutritional delivery to organs and  tissues.  Such technoscientific approaches assume that  aging  is a technical problem best approached through engineering,  and   that   science   and technology tend  towards the better.
