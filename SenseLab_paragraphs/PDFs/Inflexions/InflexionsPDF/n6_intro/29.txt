Within  the  Keynotes section  of the  NODE,  texts  from  keynotes video  presenters (at AG3 Online)  have been compiled, which  represent an extraordinary collection of scholars and  practitioners from  art, architecture, philosophy of language, philosophy of science,  comparative literature, poetry and  poetics,  life sciences, medicine and  education. Themes  that emerge from the keynotes involve the importance of play and the role of enjoyment and elation  that Arakawa and Gins’ procedural architecture incites.  These  authors join  an  impressive list  of distinguished authors to  have  discussed Arakawa and  Gins’  work.   [5] Three keynote  texts   have   not   been   included  in  this   collection:   Takashi   Ikegami’s interview with  Mia Kukamara and  Don  Byrd and  Makenzie Warks’ improvised conversation (both found through http://ag3.griffith.edu.au/) and Shaun  Gallagher’s essay,  which  has  previously been  published: “Aesthetics and  Kinaesthetics” can be found in Sehen und Handeln. Eds. Horst  Bredekamp and  John  Michael  Krois. Berlin: Oldenbourg Verlag, 2011: 99-113.
