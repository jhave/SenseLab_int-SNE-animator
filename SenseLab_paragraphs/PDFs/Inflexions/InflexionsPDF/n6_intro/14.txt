The  papers collected  here  assist  us  in  refocusing interdisciplinary  or transdisciplinary approaches to  the  observation, study  and  transformation of embodied approaches for collective  concerns. Arakawa and  Ginsâ€™ project,  in this regard, is the  most  advanced and  inclusive, addressing the  human question in both practical and  theoretical ways  while  resisting the  tendency to separate out certain  ideas  or methods for special  consideration. Each aspect of their practice tests our  seriousness,  challenges  our  commitment   and  implicates  us   in   a  history   of
acquiescence.
