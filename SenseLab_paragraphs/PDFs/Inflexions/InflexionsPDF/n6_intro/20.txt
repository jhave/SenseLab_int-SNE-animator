A little more  than  two weeks  after the closing  events  at Barnard College  and  the Guggenheim  Museum  in   New   York,   Arakawa  died   on   May   18,  2010.  In retrospect, from  around November 2009, Arakawa had  become  more  reclusive. Always generous  with   their   time  and   energy,  the  couple   was  not  receiving visitors with  the frequency with  which  they  were  accustomed and  the openness for which  they  were  renowned.  They  would often  call scholars or practitioners out of the blue after having read  an essay or book and,  without much  ceremony, launch into intense discussion. They received and  cultivated friendships with people from  all walks  of life and  would talk to anyone interested in moving the collective  discussion forward.
