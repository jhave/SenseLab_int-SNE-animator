Madeline Gins is continuing the work  that she and Arakawa started 40 years ago. In the near  future we may  see The Mechanism of Meaning housed in a permanent collection   and   major   exhibitions  of  Arakawa’s  work.   Madeline  is  currently producing work  for  new  architectural commissions and  is activating Bioscleave House for diverse new  communities. Organisms that  person today, architectural bodies  … not if but when.
