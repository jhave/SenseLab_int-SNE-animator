a.      Parlaying  indirectness.  Gins and  Arakawaâ€™s term  organism- person-environment    [22]   signals the   permeability  that   tentative- ness  may  produce, which  would countermand  the   fixity   of identity  in   favor   of  continuity and  modulation. New  modes of continuity (reconfiguration of the senses,  changes to the extent  of person, interaction of perceptual and conceptual processing, etc) generated by procedural archi- tecture are replete with  emergent connections that  deregulate the labor required to move from organism to person to surround. The deregulation of movement across   material processes and scales  of  action   emphasizes  the link  between research and embodied    practice,   which     in turn,  makes  disciplinary findings available   for    collaborative inquiry.    Indirectness   involves
