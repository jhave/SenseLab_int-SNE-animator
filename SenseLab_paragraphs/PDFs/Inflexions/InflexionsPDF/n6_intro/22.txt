This  collection   of  essays   is  not   a  bouquet  of  flowers   for  Arakawa,  it  is  a continuation of the vitality that  Arakawa brought to all aspects of his life and  his collaboration with  Madeline Gins.  While  celebrating their  work,  the  aim  of this collection  is to rigorously engage and  continue the line of enquiry that  his work with  Madeline Gins has set in motion. This aim is best served by wrestling with the  prompts, prods and  puzzles initiated by Arakawa and  Gins  that  sustain us most.  The aim of this  introduction is to provide a sense  of the rich context  from which  the online  conference arose  in March  2010 as well as implications and  the applications towards which  Arakawa and Ginsâ€™ procedural architecture point.
