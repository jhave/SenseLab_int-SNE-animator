Throughout this  collection,  readers will  find  that  ethical  concerns raised  by the authors point  to  ways  in  which  otherness emerges and  dissolves through the fluctuations  in  the  organism-person-environment.  All  that   emerges, whether foreseen or  unanticipated, must   be  given   room   to  operate. By  exploring the extent  of ‘person’  through the  work  of Arakawa and  Gins,  new  dimensions to inter-subjectivity may  allow  our  most  basic  efforts  to think,  feel, say and  act in the world to reconfigure.
