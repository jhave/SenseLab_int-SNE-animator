2.  A  second  sticking   point   that many  persons face when encountering Arakawa and  Gins’ project  is the observation that architecture   is   static    and therefore  a   person  would  get “used to”  the  disorientation that procedural architecture produ- ces. It is argued that  the  fixity of architecture would undo procedural  architecture’s useful- ness  as an ongoing research tool. Architecture does not change or move,  at least  not  at a tempo we would describe as movement. Objections to reversible destiny based  on a notion that  archi- tecture is static  does  not  account for the way complex forms participate in the dynamic relationships  with   other   things, co-mingling material processes and    meaningful   consequences. For   example,   books    and paintings, like architecture, are static objects in this generalized sense. In books, the words do not re-assemble from day-to-day or year-to-year and  paint   does  not re-arrange (other  than  to fall off, crackle,  fade)  … yet from  day-to- day and year-to-year, one’s engagements with  a  select  book
