This  special   issue   of  Inflexions  on  Arakawa  and   Gins  is  not  a  linear,   static construction of texts that  presents itself to each reader in the same  way.  Readers are themselves an unruly bunch,  who  plunder and  reassemble texts by jumping straight to  the  last  page,  dipping in  here  and  there,  beginning in  the  middle, never  finishing … Even before the multi-stable ambiguities of horizon-fusing hermeneutics,  in  which   each   reader  is  their   own   interpretive  context,   texts fragment and  unify  against the  plan  of  authors and  publishers and  with  the freedom of  movement readers  engage or  let  slip.  We  invite  you  to  take  full advantage of a procedural approach and  construct the collection  for yourself on new  terms  each  time.  This introduction does  not  accept  that  readers are  free to rebuild the  text  – it demands it. Like the  collection  of essays  it introduces, this necessary contingency embraces archi-textual multiplexity by providing nothing more  or less than  an aggregation of places  to land  on, in, from  and  through so that each reader can hyper-tect their own dwelling with Arakawa and Gins.
