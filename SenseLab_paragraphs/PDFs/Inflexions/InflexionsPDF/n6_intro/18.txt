Arakawa and  Gins  make  their  position known by building the  procedures that become  new environments as well as constructing approaches by which  the environment may  be  occupied, individually and  collectively. Once  acquainted with  their  reversible destiny  project,  it is possible to observe how  Arakawa and Gins  continually modulate, restate and  re-think their  position, connecting the dots  differently each  time.  This  is  what  they  mean  by  bioscleave: the  constant joining  and  separating of segments of awareness (cleaving). Architectural procedures cleave  segments of awareness while  infusing tentativeness through the process  in order to hold  open  as many  opportunities for cleaving as possible. The two aspects of reversible destiny must  operate together: the cleaving of awareness alongside the  imperative to  carry  this  out  with  tentativeness. In this way  persons may  participate in the  world-forming capacity that  Arakawa and Gins  once called  the blank [2] to indicate the unformed potential through which forms  to emerge, and  now  call architectural body, to indicate the inseparability of the organism-person-environment.
