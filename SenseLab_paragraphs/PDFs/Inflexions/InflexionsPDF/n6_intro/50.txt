Of  course,   a  constant and ongoing re-entry practice such  as the  one  Arakawa  and   Gins promote,  must   be  complex enough to sustain engagement over time. If a system  becomes complex enough in the relationships that  it offers,  it will continuously generate sets of infinite  possibility and potential reconfigurations. The invention and  assembly of architectural procedures involves producing conditions that  are  not  the  equal of life, but  are equally generative of  life  on   other   terms.   In  this way,   Arakawa  and   Ginsâ€™ reversible destiny  project  shares with  Artificial  Life researchers an emphasis  on  the  generative without attachment to the form that  sentience takes  or the matter from which  sentience emerges.
