The making of the world is a twofold process  in constant flux. To engage with  its potential no  one  segment, process  or  modality takes  precedence over  another. The task of a daily  research approaching meaning and  value  procedurally would be to devise  and  revise  “the  types  and  combinations of bodily  movements most conducive to an  optimal tentative constructing towards a holding in place  and which  constructed discursive sequences best constrain them.” [3] Observe, learn, study, reconfigure, transform … then  re-enter observation, learning, what  counts as knowledge and  continue to reconfigure … to not  to die.  Decide  for yourself how  impossible tasks  enhance perception and  action.  Don’t  judge  too  quickly, remain purposeful and  have  a supply of tentativeness. Parlay  indirectness. Ask all your  intelligence to  speak.  Don’t  be  so damned sure  of yourself. Build  the question. Write  what  the  question invites  you  to do.  When  confronted with  the challenges that  Arakawa and  Gins pose, join the “dance of attention” (Manning). Ask: How  serious are we about  our commitment to closure?
