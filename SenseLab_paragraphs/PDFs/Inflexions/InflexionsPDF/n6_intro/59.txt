Yet the ideology of the technoscientific practices underwriting current global  destruction depends entirely on erection of universal, unchanging, immortal truths.

It is the movement through tentative   nets    of   relationships that    brings     (an)    architectural body  to life. By factoring the emergence of unanticipated connections into procedural architecture, one might  begin to devise  conditions and  environ- ments    that   dilate    relationships and hold them  open  for re-entry.
