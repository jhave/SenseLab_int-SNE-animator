Indeed, much  of the 20th  century saw improvements in life expectancy. The 1990s saw expansion of the role of government in health,  e.g.   anti-smoking legislation and Safe Sex campaigns, coupled with  an increased sense  of individual responsibility for lifestyle  choices of diet and  exercise.  Yet since 1990, rates  of life expectancy increase have   slowed  or  stalled.   In  Canada,  from
1920  to  1992,  life  expectancy  rose  by  16 years  for males  and  20 for females.  [10] But it was  the  same  in  2003 as it was  in  1992.
