How  to proceed after a conference is done?  Dine, reflect, expand; share  findings. AG3 produced a hothouse for cross-pollination. Like the previous Arakawa and Gins conferences in Paris and Philadelphia, AG3 re-evaluates and focuses our understandings of and  solutions to the  intersection of scientific  findings, social inquiry, and   organizational  structures.  The  present collection   testifies   to  the scope and  impact of a procedural approach that lay in the links explored through the  perspectives and  practices of the  contributing authors. The  papers selected for this special  issue of Inflexions reflect the wide  range  of research that  Arakawa and   Ginsâ€™   work   draws  upon  and  influences  across   the   arts,   sciences   and humanities.
