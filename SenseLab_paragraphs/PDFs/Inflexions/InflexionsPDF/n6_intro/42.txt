1.  The   first   sticking    point   for many   people  is  the  declaration “We   have   decided  not   to  die” most    famously   emblazoned across    the   cover    of   the   1997
Guggenheim catalogue. The undertow of this confronting statement   stems    from    its personal  nature  yet  also implicates   the    reader immediately by positioning them potentially as supporters of the conditions  that   make   this statement seemingly impossible. Many  mistake this  as  an immortality  scheme   or   an absurdist proposition, an ironic stance  thrown in the face of a troubled world. The point, however, is not to defy or erase death, but  to test  the  seriousness of anyone who  proposes to be an advocate for health, increased capacity and collective  action. Arakawa and  Gins concede “perhaps a  less  terrifying and therefore more  inviting way  … is as  an  open  challenge to  our species  to reinvent itself and  to desist  from foreclosing on any possibility, even those our contemporaries judge  to be impossible.” [21]
