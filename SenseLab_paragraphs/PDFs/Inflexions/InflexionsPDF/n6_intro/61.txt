conception  of  truth.  That  is,  truths themselves  are  born,   grow,   perhaps flourish, and  eventually die. Critiques of science  and  technology that  target universalist conceptions of truth suggest instead  eco-logical   epistemologies  that model   knowledge  on  natural  process toward sustainable praxes  of science  and technology; that  is, they ground praxes  that work  with  natural process  rather than seeking   to  control   and   dominate  nature. [17] Is refusal  to die at the heart  of the eco- problem ideologically as well  as obviously practically (how many  immortals can one planet sustain)? Are AG incompatible with sustainability?
