Arakawa and  Gins  play  a crucial  role  in  the  alterative history of art  and  art- science. As thinkers who have tried  to make  connections across materialism, speculation and  abstraction, their  unique approach to making distinctions and emphasizing continuity is always aimed at producing new  knowledge, finding new  modalities of meaning and  examining the  way  value  is  assigned.   Their work  demonstrates the  seriousness required to bring  everything to bear  on the present moment. Deciding not  to die  tests  us in each  moment and  allows  us to witness the ongoing experiment of perceiving, thinking, feeling and  talking endlessly about  everything as an art of not dying.
