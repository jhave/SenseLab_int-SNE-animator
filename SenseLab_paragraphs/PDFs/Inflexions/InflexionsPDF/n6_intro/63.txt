Irigaray  argues  in  Speculum  of  the  Other
 wide,  that  is, built  investigations that engage connection across the organism-person-environment. Heuristic	   tools 	 are 		 pragmatic. They   prompt  perceptions and actions.		   They 	  evaluate	  and question the assignation of value. In 	the 		  case 		 of		 procedural architecture,  the   heuristic  tools prompt 		re-entry,	tentativeness, indirectness,		 sited 	 awareness, landing site  configurations, per- ceptual 		  learning,		  procedural knowing,  etc.  Heuristics  is  not processes 	 of	   production 		but supplies  an   additional  loop   of awareness 		 conditioning 		 the possibilities 	of	  production. 	  In Arakawa		and 	Gins’	reversible destiny project,  heuristic tools  are presented 	   in 		 the 		  form 	  of tactically 		  posed 			surrounds, which 	ask 	 the 	perceiver 	  to become  aware of the way  s/he is perceiving.			 Heuristic		tools whether		  built 	 hypotheses 	  or discursive  sequences, are  of  no use if they  do not provide a way forward, a way of learning.
