You will also find a TRIBUTES  section  that  consists  of reflective  evaluations and personal accounts of Arakawa. The TANGENTS section  offers works  that  use Arakawa and  Gins  as a starting point  or a springboard to further thought. Two texts  began  life at the Guggenheim event  in May 2010: Erin Manning and  Brian Massumi’s text  mixes  Arakawa and  Gins,  Deleuze, Whitehead and  others in a series of voiced  riffs while  Ken Wark distills  from Arakawa and  Gins’ procedural approach  a  numbered  set  of  reworked  propositions. There   are  also  several evocative video  works  included in  the  TANGENTS section  that  have  emerged from  wrestling with  the poetic  proposition of Arakawa and  Gins’ work  (George Quasha) and the spatial characteristics of Bioscleave House (Bob Bowen).
