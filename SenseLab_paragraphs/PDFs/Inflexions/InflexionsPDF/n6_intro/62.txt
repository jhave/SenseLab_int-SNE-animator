AG make  nonsense of the human/nature, nature/civilization  either-ors that  make these  questions possible. Their  immortality is procedural â€“ never  fixed and  static, but always  on   the   move,   provisional. Personing,  organisming  is  valued inherently,  while   truths are  instrumental, and   come   and   go.   This   is   not hypostatization of libidinal economies, but a critical,  ethical  call to conscience in which the destiny of technoscientific capital  is reversed   by    proceduring   responsibility. Why  cannot  personing be green?  How  can it be anything but?
