The diagram’s inherent relationality makes  diagrammatic praxis  infinite.  Infinite mutation.  The  immortality  of  the   almost.   This  immortality  –  the   extensive continuum of  the  force  of  form  – is  not  the  event  as  such.  The  event  is  the constriction of this infinitude at its agitating limit. This limit agitates at the cusp, always on  the  edge  of dephasing. Immortality is not  known as  such.  What  is known is what  actualizes. The between of the known and  the unknowable – their relational  milieu    –   is   bare   activity,    agitation  at   the   limit   where  events individualize. “The individual is not finitude but  limit,  that  is to say, capable  of infinite  growth” (Combes  1999: 38). Finitude is a demonstration of a procedural linearity that  presupposes that  time  and  space  are  pregiven. An  event  is never borne  of linearity. It is a limit-concept, itself always on the cusp  of individuation
– or perishing, in Whitehead’s vocabulary – onto  the  nexus  of lived  experience. Individuation is immortal not  in its eventness but  in its transductive potential. The  dance  of attention, while  not  itself  immortal – carries  this  immortality in germ  as its preindividual share  of potential. In the dance  of attention, the event  is attentive to the limit, the event  agitates the limit.
