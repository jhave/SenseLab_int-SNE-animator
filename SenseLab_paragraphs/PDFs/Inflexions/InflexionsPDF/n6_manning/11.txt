From  the  first  to  the  second step,  the  activity  of spacing is emphasized. This spacing-with is a procedure not so much  for opening a closed  diagram as for the bringing forth  of  active  intervals – associated milieus   – within the  diagram’s force of form.  The preacceleration of movement incipiently moving is a spacing- with  already constitutive in germ.  Preacceleration is a virtual pre-movement that activates the conditions for experiencing and  moving the relation. With the opportunity for relation constitutive of the activity  of spacing, the diagram itself preaccelerates toward  its  tendencial  elasticity.  This  activity   in  germ   –  bare activity  [2] – connects directly with  the body  moving into the opening. The body- spacing – not your  body  exactly,  but  a body-elastic co-constituted in the spacing
– is an assemblage of the diagrammatic praxis  and  its inherent potential for movement. It is not  a representation of a pre-existent body  but  the  sensing in
