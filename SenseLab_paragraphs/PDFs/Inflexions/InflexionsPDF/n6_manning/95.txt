“We  should name  the  body  every  time.  We know  NOTHING about  the  body! We should do this  naming all the  time,  like food.  Ah, that’s ketchup. Ah, that’s knee”  (Gins in Kennedy 2006). Arakawa and  Gins’ architectural procedure never escapes   naming.  Naming  is  procedural.  It  acts  as  a  point   of  inflexion   that dephases  individuation  propelling  individualisations,  that   transduces multiplicity, creating singular events.  These events,  including the mode  of knee, the mode  of ketchup, of death, and  of a life – to bring  Deleuze into the mix – are radically  empirical.  They   are   activated  relationally  through  specific   sets   of conditions in an elastic  procedurality that  folds  in to create  a dance  of attention and out to create an individualization.
