A mobile  architecture is not  a resting place  for human bodies,  nor  is it a built enclosure. Like  the  diagrammatic praxis   of  the  movement exercise  recounted above,  a  mobile  architecture is  about   the  fielding of  experimental spacetimes such  that  they  produce an  intensive turbulence that  becomes   the  force  for  a distillation of intensive or absolute movement. The mobile  architecture of a choreography  is  not   the   plan   of  the   movement  or  the   partitioning  of  the individual  bodies   in  space.   It  is  the   relational  force  that   persists  from   the collective  movementâ€™s incipient cueings and  alignings, the incipient priming gathered as a force field not of the bodies  per  se, but  of the active  intervals their relational movement creates,  intervals that  in turn  propose multiplicities in the moving.
