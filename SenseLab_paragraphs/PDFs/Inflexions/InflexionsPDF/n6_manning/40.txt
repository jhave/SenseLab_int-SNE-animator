intensity that  carry  emergence across  iterations. Emergence, understood  as  a quality of  infinite   potential with   a  margin of  indetermination  at  its  core,  is sustained by the very  elasticity of the nodes  of intensity, an elasticity that  bends spacetime to make  space  for points of inflexion  that,  in turn,  create  differentials of relation.
