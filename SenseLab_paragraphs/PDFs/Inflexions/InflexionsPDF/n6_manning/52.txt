Dephasing is the transductive operation of a milieu.  It occurs in the relational movement  of  the   shift   in  levels   of  a  process.   Within   each   dephasing,  the preindividual share  of  potential is  carried across,  through. The  preindividual itself is always unphased. It operates across and  through. It is the preacceleration of all relational movements distributed across phases. It is the force of potential – Deleuze’s  a life – that  subsists after  and  through each  individuation. It  is  the “faire”  in the “faire oeuvre” of the work’s (re)making.
