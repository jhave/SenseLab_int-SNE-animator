In this  context,  politics  can  only  be procedural. A set  of conditions, a series  of enabling constraints, collective  politics  – politics  of collective  individuation – are attentive to  the  ontogenetic modulations of modes of existence  in  the  making. The  social   does   not   preexist  them   –  it  is  co-founded  in  and   through  the procedures that activate event-time.
