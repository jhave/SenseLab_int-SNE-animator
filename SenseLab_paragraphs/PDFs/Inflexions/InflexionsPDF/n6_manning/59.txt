Modes  of existence  are events  in-formed through the activity  of dephasing across diagrammatic registers. Emergent across,  in-formation is not  the  settling of the event  into  an identity, but  the  many-phasing of the  event  into  an experience of the multiple now.  In-formation is a complex reworking of any theory of communication  that  would assume that  what   dephases comes  already fully- formed. In-formation not  only  provokes a shift  of register, it  foregrounds the force of form as that  which  modulates all subsequent differential becomings. It is immanent to the event.  In-forming, the event  attends to its force of form.
