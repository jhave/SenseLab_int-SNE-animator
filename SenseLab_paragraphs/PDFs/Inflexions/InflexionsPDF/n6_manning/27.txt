Diagrammatic  praxis    is   an   experiment  in   cueing    and   aligning  aimed  at experiencing the  elasticity of  spacetime. How  does  the  creation of  a  diagram morph into  a fielding that  expands beyond the  visual  data  of space  mapped? What  happens when  the  choreographic field  does  not  begin  with  a pre-existent mapping onto  which  moving bodies  are  subsequently integrated? How  is the moving body  (re)created diagrammatically? How  does  the aligning body  morph into a diagrammatic praxis  in its own right?
