What  emerges as a dance  of attention cannot  be replicated. It is not  a thing,  a form.  In Forsythe’s One Flat Thing, Reproduced, the dance  of attention emerges as the  lived  experience of tables  dancing and  bodies  tableing across  durations of infra-dimensional  movement  moving.  In  the  watching,  we  experience spacetime’s emergence through  movement  itself,  an  incipient emergence that backgrounds the  actual   bodies   in  their  dancerly separateness and  creates   an active associated milieu  between bodies,  objects and  the choreographic field. One Flat Thing, reproduced’s dance  of attention makes  felt how  the  event  of dancing cues to force of form.
