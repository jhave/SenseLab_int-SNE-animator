and   becomes   an  emergent mode   of  existence.   This  is  a  shift  in  register –  a movement across  the  surface  of the  diagram of spacetiming – more  than  it is a difference in  kind.  Each  mode  of existence  is replete with  singularly multiple events  in  the  making. The  singularly multiple tendencies are  potential divergences, hic-ups, discontinuities, and,  as such,  they  constitute the  mode  of existence’s  margin of indetermination. This margin, its share  of preindividual potential, is what  sustains the emergent quality of modes of existence  in time.
