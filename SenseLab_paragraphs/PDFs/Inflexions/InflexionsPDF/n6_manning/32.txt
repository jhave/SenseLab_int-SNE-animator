little  opportunity for  what  Susanne Langer  calls  the  commanding form (Langer
1979: 123, 134) of the piece, its force of form across iterations. Also called “matrix idea,”  commanding form  is the virtual force – or diagram, as Bacon calls it, with reference to painting – of a composition’s inherent potential for recomposing. It is the intensive magnitude of the emergent co-expression of the composition of a musical score and its performance. The “how” of the work  as it is replayed across settings and  environments is  its  commanding form.  This  “how” is  emergent anew  each time, yet carries  a precision of technique. This technique – the work’s remembering the  future – cannot  be felt in the  distinct musical notes  or danced movements, but through the relational environment they make  possible. The commanding form of a piece is its mobile  architecture. This mobile  architecture is the artwork’s dance  of attention.
