Contemporary politics  tend  to be preemptive. They lack time. Or better,  they monopolize time in their  preying on memories of past-future fear. The event  will have   always  already  taken   place.   Preemptive  politics’  dance   of  attention  is primed for a recursive individuation. What  is held  over  as the  event’s affective resonance is the already of the event’s in-forming. Invention, certainly, but held in the  tight  vicious  circle of terror.  There  is always already nothing that  can  have been done.  The event  that has not yet taken  shape  has already changed the shape of its  potential landing site.  We  are  poised at  the  defensive cusp  of what  we should have already known and what  we will already have imagined.
