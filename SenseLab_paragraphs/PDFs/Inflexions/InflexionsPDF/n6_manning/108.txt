[2]  Bare  activity   is  a  concept   that   emerges  from   Brian  Massumi’s  work   on preemption, perception and  politics  in an unpublished book manuscript entitled Perception Attack. He defines bare activity  as “human life in the instant’s off-beat. In that  instant, a life is barely there,  recoiled, bodily  consumed in its infra-relation to  itself.  It is a life without determinate content. In that  imperceptible instant, what  its content will  be next  is in the  making. A life is formatively barely  there, tensely  poised for what  comes next. In that  measureless instant, a life is intensely barely  there,  regathering in an immediacy of its capabilities. This is not  vitality reduced to the minimum, this is life primed. This is also war.  The life primed may indeed be in proximity to death. Yet the  body  is already arcing  toward a next vital  exercise  of its capacity to act. Not  re-animalization: re-animation: a stoking for the  next  step.  This  is a far cry from  a life reduced to brute  matter. It is the embodied event  of a life regathering in recoil. This is life self-enfolding in affective vitality.”
