As Brian Massumi underlines, the continuity created through the emergence of a third plane  of operation “moves across  the difference. It comes  into  itself across the difference, from which  it simultaneously separates itself to claim an operative autonomy as a qualitatively new  regime of functioning.” [4] In the  case  of the diagram morphing through the  infringement of a body  introducing movement, what  emerges is not a triple  singularity: a body,  a diagram, a movement. A new diagram emerges that  includes movement and  body,  a diagram that  does  not negate its predecessor, but  traces  itself on its predecessor’s incipiently emergent topological surface.
