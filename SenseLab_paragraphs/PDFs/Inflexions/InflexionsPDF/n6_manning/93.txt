Arakawa and  Gins’ procedures create  affordances [10] for the dance  of attention. Always embedded in associated milieus  of relation, they  land  the event  in ways that  exceed  expectation. Their  injunction to “sited  awareness” foregrounds the impossibility of locating  a  site  once  and  for  all.  As  Jondi  Keane  foregrounds, what  Arakawa and  Gins  propose is an  ecology  of relations that  concerns the shaping of awareness (Keane 2007: 439, Arakawa and Gins 1997: 86).
