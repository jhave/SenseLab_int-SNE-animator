Individuation is a diagrammatic praxis.  It does not operate on a pre-imposed timeline  but   morphs  across   topological  registers  of  co-constitution:  space- bodying, time-spacing. This co-constitutive force of becoming dephases into multiple tendencial registers of experience, making itself felt across associated milieus  of relation.
