The dance  of attention is the associated milieu  of the event  in-formation gathered into an intensity at the cusp of action. A holding pattern, the dance  of attention is the intensive elasticity of the eventâ€™s distributed relational movement. A shift toward  the  political   happens,  I  would  argue,   when  the  dance   of  attention explicitly  tends  toward relationality as such. When  it does, the dance  of attention begins  to make time for the articulation of a proto-politics in germ.
