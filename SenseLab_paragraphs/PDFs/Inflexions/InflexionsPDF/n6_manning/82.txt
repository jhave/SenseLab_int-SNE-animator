Collectivity for Simondon is subtraction of the tendency to limit becoming to the realm  of the individual. Individuation is multiple, interscalar, transductive, metastable. The more-than-individual carried by each individuation is the expressive potential of an interval: the relation of relations. “The discovery of the transindividual emerges from  the encounter and  requires solitude as a milieu  to traverse” (Combes  1999: 66). Collectivity not as the multiplication of individuals but as the solicitude of the multiple across the quietude of the interval.
