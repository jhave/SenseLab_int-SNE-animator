The  time   of  the  event   is  multi-scalar.  “Between  the  physical  and   the  vital, between the  plant  and  the  animal, we must  not  look  for substantial differences capable   of  creating distinctions of  genre   or  species,  but  rather  differences of speed in  the  process   of  their  formation” (Combes   1999: 42).  Organisms that person populate the  intensive strata  of the  dance  of attention, but  they  do  not monopolize it.  Different speeds  co-exist  in  an  infra-species, infra-dimensional field.  The  dance  of attention is a tentative holding-in-place of agitation at  the limit  where speciation and  dimensionalizing meet.  It is the  holding-in-place of the rhythm of the infra where becoming is on the cusp of defining itself as this or that.  “What  separates being  into  domains is nothing more  than  the  rhythm of becoming” (Combes  1999: 42).
