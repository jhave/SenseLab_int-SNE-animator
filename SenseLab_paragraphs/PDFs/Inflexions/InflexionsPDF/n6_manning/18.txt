Spacetime  mutating,  becoming-bodies  morphing  on   an   ontogenetic diagrammatic nexus  â€“ this is the expressive force of relational movement. While relational movement can operate between two bodies,  can be felt as the relational interval of the preacceleration of a body  moving-toward and  with  another body, relational movement never  operates solely  between two.  It is always multiple, always already distributed in  morphing spacetimes of experience. Distributed relational  movement   is   the   form   movement  takes   when  it   becomes    the ontogenetic expression of diagrams recombining. Relational movement is the intense force of recombination that  activates the individuation of a diagrammatic praxis  of spacetime.
