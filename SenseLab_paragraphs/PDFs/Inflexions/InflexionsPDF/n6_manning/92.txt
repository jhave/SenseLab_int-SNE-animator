Events   carry   as  their   preindividual  share   a  receptiveness  to  the   dance   of attention. They  populate modes of existence  that  are themselves attentive to the collective  enunciations of  procedural potential. The  politics-in-germ of  event- time  is their  ethics.  It is that  which  “contains in itself a power of amplification,” that    which    always   remains   capable    of   entering   into    relation   with    its preindividual share  (Simondon 1995: 16). This entering into relation is the act par excellence, and this is what  the event  is attentive to in its dance  of attention.
