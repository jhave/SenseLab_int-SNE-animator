Take the  architecting for mobility of a hospital as an example. Think  of what  it holds  in place, and  what  it provokes as its dance  of attention. Recall the last time you went  to a hospital and  re-experience its entropy of sameness, pale  wall after pale  wall,  high  bed  after  high  bed,  closed  curtain after  closed  curtain, double- doors  after  double-doors. Recall the  smell.  All this  in the  name  of so-called  life. Yet a procedurality not  for life, not  for dancing or cooking  or laughing, but  for dying. The hospitalâ€™s dance  of attention is an attending to death. Its double-doors always lead to a similar  refrain:  death, death, death.
