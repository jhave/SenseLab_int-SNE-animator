In the  movement exercise,  a notable dephasing comes  in the  standing. Here,  in the  recalibration of equilibriums, preaccelerations of movement potential cross the  vertical-horizontal axes. Preacceleration happens less in an individual body than  in the intervals proposed by movement’s inherent relationality. When  a diagrammatic preacceleration is felt, what  has shifted is not the body  per se, but the   conditions  for  bodying  in  movement.  As  participants  stand  with   their shifting diagrams, what  tends  to happen is the  experience of an intensifying of mutation, a multiplying of intervals. This is experienced as, for instance, a heightened sense  of the affective  tonality of spacetime. Here,  the diagram tends to emphasize the kinesthetic: participants talk about  the intensification of sound or touch  with  the felt experience of space  becoming multi-dimensional, an infra- dimensionality perhaps,  caused  by  the  shift  in  ground.  In  the  mutation  of ground,  the   tendency  may   be   less   toward  displacement,  less   toward  the multiplying of potential grounds than  toward an  infra-dimensionalising of the very  idea  of ground itself.  In  this  infra-dimensionalising posture, participants tend  toward absolute movement where the potential for the exploration of preacceleration’s interval in continuous modulation can  be felt most  strikingly. This infra-dimensionality is expressive of the multiplicity of intervals themselves creating openings for the moving.
