A  note:  the  body  holding itself  must  not  be  thought as  a  reinstituting of the individual as  the  mediator of  event-time,  or  of  the  dance   of  attention.  The holding is what  creates  the  relation body-movement-spacetime. It is a holding that  exceeds  the personing of spacetime, a holding that  is more  a patterning that a grasping onto, a holding always on the edge of transduction.
