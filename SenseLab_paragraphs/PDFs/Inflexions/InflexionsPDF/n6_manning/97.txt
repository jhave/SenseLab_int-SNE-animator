Arakawa and  Gins’ procedure for life (because it is that,  much  more  than  it is a procedure against death) screams Nietzsche’s refrain  “Was  that  Life? Well then, once  more!”  (1966: 157).  “Reversible Destiny,”  their  procedural  manifesto, is based  on “an  ethics  that  permits no category of event,  not  even  mortality, to be set  apart for  special   treatment, and  that  considers there   to  be  nothing more unethical than  that  we are required to be mortal”(2002: xviii). A politics  for life, with  life, reversible destiny names life as an event  in its own  right  that  takes  life- living  as its starting point,  remaining attentive to something akin  to Deleuze’s  a life, the  preindividual force  of life that  accompanies all modalities of existence. Reversible Destiny draws into  attentiveness the  milieu  of life as it lives.  It is a dancing into  attentiveness of the  potential of the  relation, of the  commanding form  that  resonates in  a  diagrammatic praxis  of  invention. This  is  politics  in germ,  a politics  preaccelerating toward articulation, toward creation. By taking life as the  field  of invention, by making life the  procedural condition for event- time, Arakawa and Gins enact a politics  of performance.
