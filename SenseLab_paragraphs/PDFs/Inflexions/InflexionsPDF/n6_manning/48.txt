Modes  of existence  are  always plural and  intermodal: “existence can  be found not only in beings,  but between them” (Souriau 1943/2009:  16). They do not reify existence  as already-constituted – they  are  modalities of singular events  in the making.  As  a  mode   of  existence,   the   dance   of  attention  is  a  continuously emergent  multiplicity that   creates   a  singular feeling   even  while   it  provokes divergent constellations of futures in the making. The singular feeling  is less that which  we can know  than  that through which  the movement itself dances.
