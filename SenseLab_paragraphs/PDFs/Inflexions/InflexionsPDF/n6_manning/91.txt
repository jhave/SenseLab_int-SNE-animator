metric  time,  intensive movement and  displacement, the  diagrammatic praxis  of an event  is how  that  event  becomes  attentive to its own  singularity in time.  This singularity is transindividual, “an  impersonal zone  […] that  is simultaneously a molecular dimension  or  intimate dimension  of  the  collective   itself”  (Combes
1999: 87).
