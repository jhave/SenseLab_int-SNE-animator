The initial  tendency is to place  movement in the human body.  This is especially the  case in the  context  of choreography, where the  dancing body  tends  to be at the  forefront. In  a  recent  paper entitled Choreography as Mobile Architecture,  I explore  how movement moves  in two distinct instances â€“ in William  Forsythe choreography, One Flat Thing, Reproduced as featured on the  Synchronous Objects website, and  in the  participatory installations of my  own  artwork, Slow Clothes and  Volumetrics.  [3] In  Choreography as Mobile Architecture,  my  focus  is on  the ways  in  which  these  two  variants of  choreographic  practice create  their  own
complex diagrams, a mobile architecture as I define  it in that piece.
