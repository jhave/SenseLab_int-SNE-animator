Cues  play  with  memory, yet  their  modality is not  recall.  A dancer’s response based  on recall would be far too slow,  especially in the case of the rapid flow of Forsythe’s singular movement exploration. The  cue  mobilizes not  memory as pre-existent,  but   memory  as  crafted  in  movement.  Memory  is  the  force  of attention mobilized in an emergent spacetime. Memory not  in and  of the  body, but with the body-event of space timing.
