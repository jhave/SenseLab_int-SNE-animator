Step  6 is  all  about   circulation: “if  novel  ways  of  structuring an  architectural surround to produce the hoped-for outcome tend  to turn  up on a fairly frequent basis, that  should be taken  as indication enough of its being  a keeper” (Arakawa and  Gins  2003: 14). Circulation happens  on  many  scales  at  once,  on  different timelines,  creating  topologies  of   spacetime.  When   the   dance    of   attention circulates,  it  resists   stultification  into  a  linear   process:   birth-death. Activated through multiple contemporary dephasings in a spiraling eternal return, the interval emerges and  takes  shape  as the  radically empirical option of life itself, or, as Deleuze would say, of a life. A life: the  infra-individuation of the  force  of potential across the surface  of living itself.
