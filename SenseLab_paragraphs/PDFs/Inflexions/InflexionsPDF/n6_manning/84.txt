Arakawa  and   Gins   are  political   artists.   Their   procedures  create   a  field   for political  expression, multiplying the  “I”,  itself  a procedure that  agitates at  the cusp   of  dephasings.  When   the  relation  itself  the  modality  of  attention,  the associate  milieu   begins   to  express  the  potential of  political   force.  Politics   is expression before it is content.
