The  procedure is  itself  topological. The  first  diagram is  an  infra-layer of  the infinite  potentiality of bodying. This  bodying is an  individuation not  only  of a body-becoming but  of spacetimeâ€™s intensive mapping. Step 1 is a refrain that  at once activates and populates subsequent infra-layers of diagrammatic praxis.
