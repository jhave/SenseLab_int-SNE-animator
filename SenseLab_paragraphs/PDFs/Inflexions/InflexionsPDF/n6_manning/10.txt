Diagrammatic praxis  explores the  lived  experience of spacetime morphing. The initial  proposition for a diagram is the first step in a procedure for the fielding of spacetime’s potential in the  mapping. This first  step,  recursively attended to in subsequent diagrammings, already exceeds  a visual  mapping. While  the  initial boundaries of the  diagram may  hold  to a perspectival mapping, their  potential for variability is experienced as soon as the second diagram is proposed in step 2: find   an   opening  and   move   into   it.  The   opening  created  by   the   incipient movement in and  through is a preacceleration that  activates the  conditions for morphing of all diagrams in the making. The initial  diagram is never  replaced – the  steps   of  the  procedure are  not  linear   –  it  is  multiplied  in  a  topological remapping of the elasticity of spacetime.
