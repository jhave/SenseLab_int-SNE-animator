This movement in the dancing is not spurred solely by human intention. It erupts in the  between of the  cueing’s  aligning, in the  relational interval of distributed movement. As Brian Massumi writes  in relation to Simondon’s notion of individuation, “the  causation is always indirect, passing through an  interval of immanence: a moment of concretization whose  schema  is immanent to  active matter” (Massumi 2009). What  returns as commanding form  is not  the  form  of the event,  but the force of its formation. Cue to force of form.
