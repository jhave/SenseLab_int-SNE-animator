Preacceleration is diagrammatic praxis  at its core. It does  not occur  in space,  but creates  space  in the moving. Since it is virtual, it is experienced in its effects and tendencies:   we   cannot    make   sense   of   it   “as   such.”   Preacceleration  feeds experience in the moving at the incipient edge  where the before  and  between of movement coincide.   In  habitual  movement, preacceleration is  most  often  too fleeting  to be felt. But in a focused diagrammatic praxis,  especially in the moving across  registers of  spacetiming, it  can  be  felt,  and  it  is  this  feeling  that  most palpably makes  apparent the inherent elasticity of spacetime bodying.
