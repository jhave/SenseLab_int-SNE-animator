The time  of the event  is procedural, not linear.  With  each step  in the procedure, potential circulates. And  with  the  circulation of potential comes  the  differential of the event:  its margin of indetermination. Here,  at this cresting where the continuous and  the discontinuous meet,  novelty is invented. Think,  for instance, of Arakawa and  Gins Directions for Architectural Procedure: Invention and Assembly. Here,   Arakawa  and   Gins  use  procedures not  as  a  semiotic   strategy  –  as  a language game  – but  as a diagrammatic praxis  for the transduction of time  into event.  Procedures take time.  They may  present themselves as linear  stages  in an assemblage, but,  as Arakawa and  Gins  consistently underline, you  must  return, you  must  mix,  you  must  interweave.  Circulate, but  don’t  circle.  Tap  into  the margin  of  indetermination  that   is  the  relational  interval  of  the  procedure’s associated milieu.  Engage  not  only  with  the  steps,  do not  only  follow  them  one by one, but cross, experiment, spiral.
