A dance  of attention springs from  the  attentiveness of a diagrammatic praxis within co-constitutive spacetimes of experience. This  is not  an  attentiveness in and  of the  human body,  though the  body  can  certainly be one  of its intensive features. The dance  of attention is a co-compositional force  of diagrams for the moving  that   emerges  in  the   work’s  performances.  It  is  the   difference and repetition of performance’s ontogenetic field as it creates  space.
