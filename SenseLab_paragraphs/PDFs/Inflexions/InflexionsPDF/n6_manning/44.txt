A dance  of attention has its own technicity. For each work  – be it a choreography, a performance installation, a musical composition – a rigorous setting  into place of conditions is necessary. These conditions are always specific  to the event,  but never  completely stable  across  its iterations. Each iteration of the event  dephases the  memory  of  its  having come  into  existence.   No  movement  can  be  cued, aligned to or performed in exactly the same way twice. Conditions are pragmatic and  based,  always, on the now  of event-time as it makes  itself felt. Event-time is the foregrounding of the co-compositional infra-layering of diagrammatic force- form in the now of experience.
