Through an  in-depth analysis of the  techniques proposed by  Forsythe and  his dancers, techniques that  take priming – cueing  and  aligning – to a very  complex limit,  I explore  how  what  cues and  aligns  is not the human body  per  se, but  the landings of sites for future cueings and  alignings. These  landing sites are more- than-human. They are the active  force of movement’s fieldings in co-constitutive spacetimes of experience, felt as the coming  and going of tendencies too quick for the  actual  perceiving. What  moves  is less a movement in-itself  than  a tendency for movement. This tendency feeds  a process,  moving it toward a new  aligning.
