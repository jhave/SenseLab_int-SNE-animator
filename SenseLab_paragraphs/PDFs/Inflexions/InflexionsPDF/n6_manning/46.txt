anew  according to tight  enabling constraints. Enabling constraints focus multiplicity into emergence. Without this focus, multiplicity disperses with  little or  no  diagrammatic  force.  The  mode   of  existence   necessary  for  a  dance   of attention is that  of a resonant intensity between preacceleration of the  present futuring and  aligning to a future presenting. Topological time  squeezed into the nowness of an ontogenetic intensity.
