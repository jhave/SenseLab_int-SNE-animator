In  its  practice  of  creating  conditions  for  dephasing, metastability and transduction, procedurality is a machine for the immortality of diagrammatic praxis.   Its  naming  does   not  preempt  the  event.   It  is  the  event.   Procedural techniques are modalities for inventive identification. The naming co-exists  in an ecology   of  relations.  It  is  this  or  that,   but  also  this  with  that.  An  operative autonomy as a qualitatively new regime of functioning.
