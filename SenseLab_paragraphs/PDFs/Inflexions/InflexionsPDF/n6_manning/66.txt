Step 5. “The  hoped-for outcome may  simply spring into  existence  as a result  of what  has been worked into the architectural surround, but it is more  likely that it will only  make  an appearance indirectly, having been  brought into  existence  by called-forth sequences of actions  that  have  led  the  way  to it and  which  will,  in some  cases,  turn  out  to be, to various degrees, constitutive of it (Arakawa and Gins 2003: 14). The outcome is emergent. Conditions are set into place  for its resolution. These  conditions are,  as James  would say,  the  event’s  terminus,  the force of “ends in sight”  that  activates the event  without necessarily becoming the promise of its pre-determined goal. [6] Terminus as potential for action.  The end in sight  in-forms the event  without preempting an outcome. Terminus captivates the process  and  forces a dephasing into the remarkable point  of this or that individuating:   the   creation  of  an   architectural  body,   the   engineering  of  a reversible destiny, an organism that  persons. The outcome is reached indirectly through the relational matrix  of procedures intermixing, infra-dimensionalising.
