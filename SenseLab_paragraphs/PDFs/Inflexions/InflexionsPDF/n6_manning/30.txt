The body-event of space  timing is an aligning of the choreographic field. Bodies move  in active  memory with  spacetime realigning. They move  in active  memory of  the  present-passing, a  remembering of  the  future movement-moving. The associated milieu  created in  the  cueing-aligning elasticizes time.  Remembering the  future, bodies-spacing move  time.  Ask  a dancer to  move  exactly  the  same way  again  and  they  won’t  be  able  to  do  it.  The  movement moved them  at  a velocity  too  quick  to recall  in a time  impossible to grasp as such.  The dancer’s movement remembers what  the dancer cannot  have  known in advance, the movement itself  active  in  a  futurity  virtually  impossible to  imagine. Remembering the future is tapping into movement’s force of form, cueing  to diagrams in the making.
