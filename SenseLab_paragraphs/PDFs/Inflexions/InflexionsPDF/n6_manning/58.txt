Solicitude in-forms the  event.  It modulates the  force  of form  of relation itself. This practice of modulation – key to the creation of emergent modes of existence
–  can  be  thought as  a  micropolitical tending-toward,  a  tendency in  germ   of politics  in the  making. This is a micropolitics of the  associated milieu  itself. As such, it does not privilege the human over the more-than human.
