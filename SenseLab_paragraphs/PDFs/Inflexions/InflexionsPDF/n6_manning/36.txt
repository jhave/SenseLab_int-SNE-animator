Another way  to  talk  about   the  practices through  which   incipient tendencies express themselves is to differentiate between modes of existence.  Modes  of existence,  for Etienne  Souriau and  Gilbert  Simondon, refer to modes of invention that  act  on  the  present, altering experience in  the  making. Experience in  the making is always on the threshold. The threshold marks  the opportunity for discontinuous potentialities to  mix.  As  they  come  together – the  diagram and movement, say – what  happens is disparity: they collide in an emergent discontinuity.  This  emergent discontinuity becomes   a  continuity  only  to  the extent  that  a third is introduced:  relational movement. This  third brings  about another plane  of operation.
