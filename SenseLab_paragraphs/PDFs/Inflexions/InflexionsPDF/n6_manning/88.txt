The  incipient collectivity of political  thought resides, as Combes  articulates, in the excess of individuation, in the preindividual. This non individual share  is not constituted as an  other  individual. It is more-than (human), the  beyond-self of the trans-individuating. It is the affective  force for the incipient dephasing of individualisation, a dephasing that  is never  simply a moment in a linear  process, but a topological folding of diagrammatic forces tending toward multiple expression.
