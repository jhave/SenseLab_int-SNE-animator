The time  of the  event  is non-linear, alive  across  its dephasings. Each dephasing creates  the  conditions for a mode  of existence.  These  conditions can  be seen  as the eventâ€™s solicitude. Solicitude is a relation towards the spacing and  timing of experience in  the  making. Solicitude opens  the  mode  of  existence  in  germ  to forces of becoming. What  erupts as potential emerges in the between, in the conditions for participation the event  calls forth.  Solicitude as a reaching-toward the relation of relations. Collectivity in germ.
