“The way  the body  holds  itself, the many  ways  it holds  itself, on many  different scales  of action,  and  the  way  it holds  the  world is cumulative. All the  holding you  have  experienced, all  the  holding of you  and  by  you,  moves  within and through  your   holding  of  yourself  and   has   a   part   in   your   holding  onto something”  (Arakawa  and   Gins   2002:  82-83).  The   dance   of  attention  is  a “tentative constructing toward a holding in place”  of a potential politics  in the making (Arakawa and Gins 2002: 23).
