All individuation is modulation. Modes  of existence  never  preexist a given individuation. They  are  immanent to  it.  In  this  regard, we  could   substitute existence  with  individuation and  speak  of modes of individuation  with  respect to modes of existence. The  individualising of individuation is the  bringing forth  of diagrammatic potential to a remarkable point.  The remarkable point,  an  actual occasion,    bursts  through  not   as   a   secure    identity  but   as   the   intensive choreography of forces in the modality of matter-form. An individualization, however,  is  always  also   an  incipient  deformation,  its  remarkable  point   an itinerant inflexion  that acts as a provisory limit.
