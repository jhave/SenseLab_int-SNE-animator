The procedural art of Arakawa and  Gins does  not  accept  preemptive politics  as the  force  to create  time.  The making time  of Arakawa and  Gins’  diagrammatic praxis   is  one   of  modulation.  Modes   of  existence   are   immanent  to  it,  not constituted by it. The body  is not affectively modulated in advance of the event, poised on the cusp of the dread of not yet having known. The event  modulates in a  procedural dance  of  attention, where what  it  is  attentive to  is  not  the  past futuring, but  the  futuring of a tendency in the  making – a remembering of the future. Where  the  modes of  existence   of  preemptive politics  are  based   in  an anxiety  for the  already not  yet  known, the  politics  of performance of Arakawa and  Gins  are  full of joy in the  making, [8] activated, always, in the  modality of experimentation. Preemptive politics  make  no  time  for  experimentation in  the open  field of remembering the future: they will always already have invented the field.
