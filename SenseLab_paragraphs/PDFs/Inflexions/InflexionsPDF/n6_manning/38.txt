In the procedural exploration of space-bodying we experience dephasings less as complete shifts  in  register than  as  qualitative variations in  emphasis:  contours and    edges    background  to   make   space,   foreground  to   move-with.  These alignments  introduce  a  potential  to   the   field   that   hadnâ€™t  been   previously explored. The  individuation of the  diagram underscores the  multiple layers  of potential on its topological surface  of expression.
