The political  as mode  of existence  activated in an attentiveness to life opens  the territory to its associated milieu,  a relational matrix  that  shifts  the  I toward an Individuation not  of the  body  as such,  but  of the  body-elastic as co-constitutive of diagrammatic praxes  in the  making. A politics  of relation that  attends to the more-than-I, gathering in  the  force  of form  the  potential in  procedure that  is, itself, performance. Performance as that which  names the time of the event.
