[8] For Spinoza, joy marks  our  capacity to be affected.  “We  come  closer  to our power of action  insofar  as we are affected  by joy“ (Deleuze 1990: 246). Joy is not quantifiable, nor is it a moral  category. It is our very capacity to be affected.  Like Nietzche’s insistence on affirmation, Spinozan joy is linked  to the preindividual share: the force of a life coursing through life living.
