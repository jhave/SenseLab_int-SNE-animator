The  time  of  the  event   is  spurred by  its  immanent  terminus,  its  procedural assemblage.  The  terminus  activates  the   distributed  relational  movement.  It propels a dephasing. In a dephasing, “there is no substantial difference between interiority and  exteriority; there  are not two  domains, but  a relative distinction” (Combes    1999:  37).   [7]   Step   1   is   already  a   memory  of   step   10   infra- dimensionalizing.  Return  to  the  movement exercise  for  diagrammatic praxis. You are lying  on the ground and  the diagram is in-forming, multiplying angles and  lines,  forces  and  tendencies. As the second diagram begins  to emerge – the diagram for movement-bodying – the  first  diagram does  not  externalize: it intensifies. The two  diagrams infra-individuate. We have  not a doubling, but  an intensive multiplying of infra-dimensions. The terminus – space-bodying – does not create  a pre-composed map,  it potentializes the map,  elasticizing it with  the energy of invention.
