Each  of these  concepts – the  diagram, commanding form,  mobile  architecture, dance  of attention – is specific  to  context.  The  diagram of a painting feeds  on texture, light and incipient form, the commanding form of a musical piece creates a   sonorous   refrain    across    performances   and    recompositions,   a   mobile architecture  gives   a  sense   of  the   incipient  form-without-form  of  a  proto- architecture, and  the dance  of attention foregrounds a sense  of the attentiveness of the milieu  itself to the complex landings of experience in the making. Each of these  diagrammatic praxes  is intensively intertwined, the concepts mobilized in their  difference less  to  mark   a  general distinction than   to  orient   the  practice through which  they intensively come to expression.
