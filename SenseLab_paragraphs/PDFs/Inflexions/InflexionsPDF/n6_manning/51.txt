The force of form  is the working of the work,  or the making-work of the work  – faire oeuvre. Form  is not pre-given, it is attentively emergent. Attentively because how  it  forms  will  effect  every  other   form-taking.  Souriau’s concept   of  “faire oeuvre” highlights the  potentiality in  the  making of a work’s  taking  form.  To bring   Souriau  and   Simondon’s concepts together,  and   following  Simondon’s refuting of the hylomorphism analogous to the notions of pre-existent space  and time,  we could  say that  “faire  oeuvre” underscores that  the  making is always a dephasing.
