To have  political  content is already to have  landed in a pre-distinguishable time- zone.  Where  Arakawa and  Gins  excel is in the  creation of multiple interscalar event-times. Their architecting of mobility creates  a dance  of attention that moves incessantly in a transindividuation of collective  tendings-toward. A kitchen is an opportunity for cooking,  but it is also an invitation to climb, to sing, to sleep. The floor  is an opportunity for walking, but  it is also an invitation for dizzying, for toppling,  for  rolling.   The  event   is  an  opportunity  for  dancing,  but   also  an invitation to make time for the political.
