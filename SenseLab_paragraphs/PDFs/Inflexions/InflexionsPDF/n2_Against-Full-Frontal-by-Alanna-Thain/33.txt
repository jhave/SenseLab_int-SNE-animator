Jozic literally performs a series of “aesthetic contractions” via her contortionist movements in the limited space of the stage, and  via an emphasis on processuality, —where words are not expressed in a manner divorced from context  but are affectively contaminated by the matter at hand. As she responds to Forsythe’s presence on the screens  around her, she alternates between a slavish address to her master and a sly subversiveness, that includes a mocking “stuttering” of his speech  that becomes  more than  simply parody. Jovic’s cut-up engagement with  Forsythe’s image (only responding to certain  words, often repeating a single word obsessively as Forsythe’s speech  rolls on, unconcerned) reanimates the recording. It also gives the impression of madness described earlier,  as an “externalized interior monologue”. As audience, we see what  she sees, we hear what  she hears,  we too are infected by images  that appear at times like hallucinations, and that seem to solicit and  ignore  our response, an audiovisual ‘madness’ demanding a schizoanalytic approach. The seeable and the sayable  are reciprocally lived via the figure  of Jovic. The proximity of her performance leant a slight echo to her speech as well, a bare resonance between our live perception of it and  its transmission through the microphone and surround sound set-up. Jovic was able to exploit  this gap in order to continually
undermine the fullness  of her own presence, to animate the gap of our seeing  her saying,  at several  points in the performance. In her commentary on Forsythe’s image,  the disjunction of the missed dialogue operates as a staging of complex rhythm, the “polyphony of subjectivation”.
