Such potential is lost in the functionality of the vacuum cleaner  ad. The object Astaire  dances with remains stubbornly inert and  functional, a dour tool of domestic drudgery that disenchants Astaire  as well. While the labour of magic is made  visible--foregrounding the work  of special  effects--the potential of this labour to disrupt conventional modes of capitalist value  as coming  into being remains a mechanical, as opposed to machinic, effect. [9] While Astaire’s animatic effect in Royal Wedding is determined by the length of the song--rhythm infecting and diverting narrative, only to be contained in song and dance numbers, what  Guattari might  call a “territorialization” of the infinity of
animism--the Dirt Devil commercials remain a functional enchantment. Here
Astaire  is less an anarchic zombie  than  a robot performing precisely as we might expect him to. The deterritorialization of the image  is affected  by the internal edit of cut and  paste  digital effects--a swap  of coatrack for vacuum – as a capitalist reterritorialization returning the image  to its rightful place, productive of
revenue rather than  of new sources of experience. While the commercial had a
certain  popularity, it was also at the centre of legal and  ethical debates on the rights  of dead celebrities to control  their own image,  phrased in terms  of “what they would have wanted”, a deterministic future anterior, and of the rightful recipient of the profits  to be made. [10] Astaire  is left to be what  he was.
