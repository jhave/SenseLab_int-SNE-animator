To become  again  unknown: just a dancer. The challenge, amplified in the doubled tension of the seen and the said, of how to estrange his recognizability, lies in the creative force of art.  As Deleuze describes this in relation to writing: “to become  is not to attain  a form (identification, imitation, mimesis) but to find the zone of proximity, indiscernibility, or indifferentiation such that one can no longer  be distinguished from a woman, an animal or a molecule--neither imprecise nor general, but unforeseen and  non-preexistent, singularized out of a population rather than  determined in a form” (Deleuze, 1997: 2). This becoming is always a becoming-mortal--how to weave  a dodge in vision,  via Forsythe’s movements which  twist  and  contract in the limited space created in the paradox of an angel  of death, the finite in the infinite.   The impersonality of the creative force emerges in relation, beyond the intersubjective and positional dialogue of you and  I. Guattari writes  of “an active schizo-ontology” that will “find  an emergent alterfication relieved of the mimetic barriers of the self”; this becoming in the space of multiple perspectives and  the passages between them,  is also the aim of Fabre’s piece (Guattari, 1995: 84).
