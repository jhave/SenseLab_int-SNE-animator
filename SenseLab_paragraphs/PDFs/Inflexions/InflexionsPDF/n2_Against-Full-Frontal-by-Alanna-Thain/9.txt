Fabre’s installation performance L’Ange de la Mort participates in such an emergent alterfication via a staging of missed encounters. In “missing their mark”, by failing to be enclosed in an encounter between subjects, these missed encounters unconstrain the vectors  of intentional communication and  enable  a mutation of signification and sensation. Significantly, it is an intuitive participation in the rhythm of this alterfication--rhythm as alterfication--that leads to the characterization of this event  as “against full frontal”--against the
frontality of face-to-face  conversation that we often associate with  ethical engagement. Guattari’s “emergent alterfication freed  of the mimetic barriers of the self” is an ecological  ethics, engaged instead with  a becoming intensive of the body,  a participation in movement-vision that is about  an accumulation of relative perspectives that disorient precisely in their ordinal force. In this performance, rhythm is the form of losing oneself  precisely through intensity, a loss of footing  that leads to dancing as qualitative displacement, what  William Forsythe, performing on screen in Fabre’s piece, will describe as “dancing in the blue”. The installation event  becomes  a machine for producing alterity;  to lose one(’s) self in rhythm becomes  a means of gaining new modes of subjectivity. Sensation becomes  a mode  of interactivity suited to an audio-visual age. I will explore where rhythm is invested in this installation performance.
