Bacon’s aesthetic highlights the potential of moving from figure  to figural, focusing less on what a body  is than  on how it is.  Aesthetic sensation is the felt force of an encounter, the feeling of the event or the “feeling  of what  happens” (Massumi, 2008). Sensation (or rhythm) can be understood as the felt force of the interstice. Rhythm, as the felt togetherness of thought, movement and perception, should be understood not as a unitary synthesis but as an activation of force in the interstitial gap that brings  things into contact  with  each other,  a non-relation that is relation. Sensation occurs where rhythm meets  chaos; in this encounter, disjunctive and  competing temporalities--what Guattari calls a “polyphony of subjectivation” that “corresponds to a multiplicity of ways  of
‘keeping time’” --are felt together via the intuition of duration (Guattari, 1995:
15). Deleuze describes this as “interminable presence”, like a smile that is beyond and  beneath the face, or a scream  that survives the mouth (Deleuze, 2002: 44). Beyond  the experience of an intersubjective (or objective-subjective) encounter, the temporality of duration is filled by the distributed possession of a nexus,  a double relation between a feeling and its felt intensity and  the feeling of the feeling of intensity (Guattari, 1995: 15). In L’Ange de la Mort, the on-screen performance by Forsythe repeatedly evokes  his own blue eyes, as the figure  of both his capturing of the world (“I am constantly filming  with  my own blue eyes”) and of his possession by others;  in the end, he seeks only to dance “in the
