disjunction between seeing and speaking, between the visible and the articulable: ‘what we see never  lies in what  we say’ and  vice versa.  The conjunction is impossible for two reasons. The statement has its own correlative object and is not a proposition designating a state of things or a visible object; but neither is the visible a mute  meaning, a signified to be realised in language, as phenomenology would have it.  The archive, the audiovisual is disjunctive (Deleuze, 1988: 55).
