To see with  feeling: that is the point.  As spectator, I increasingly felt throughout the whole  piece a strange sensation of becoming “all eyes”, a chaotic multiplicity and  mutability of vision.  Former theories of cinematic spectatorship have their roots in Freudian psychoanalysis and in Sigmund Freud’s  theory of perversions, in models of mastery of the visual  field. The traditional cathedral of cinema minimizes direct  and  peripheral contact  with the spectators, and  with  all but a delimited set of sensory experiences and  a focalized visual field. With digital and video  technologies a kind  of protestant reform of cinema  has scattered screens into personal spaces  and into increasingly mobile zones.  At the same time, the computer screen  has redistributed the space of the screen  as a zone of multiple and  at times competing points of engagement. The screen increasingly becomes an attractor geared towards interaction, a distracted intentionality and a full frontality of availability. Fabre’s design choices for the installation of L’Ange de la Mort are not revolutionary, and yet they pull against this full frontality of the contemporary screen in effective and  affective ways.
