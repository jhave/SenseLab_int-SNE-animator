and  the unpredictability of his twisting movements in a limited space, that contrast a sense of duration and  uncertain directionality with  the preservation around him.  The rectangular screens  of the installation are oriented vertically, not horizontally, as if made  to the measure of the upright form of the body,  not to the cut of the face. This horizontality, a 90˚ shift from the habitual screen, reorients our usual  perception in subtle  ways. A rectangle made  to fit the whole body is at once the incorporation of an early cliché of filmed  dance--that the whole  body  be constantly shown--and at the same time evocative of a casket, a box for the body,  the limited space of a body without movement. The narrowing of the attraction of our frontal  visible field, via the expanse of “dead space”  (the black curtains forming the four walls of the space) on each side of the screen, activates our peripheral vision,  opening it to the flickering images  on the other walls and  to the moving performer on stage.  The stage space extends when the films first appear with  the long corridor of the museum, lighted escape  routes from the enclosed space that Jovic has made unbearably intimate with her proximity, her aggressive solicitation of the audience and her uncanny embodiment. When the films begin, she summons Forsythe to the stage, as he
walks down the long corridor to assume a position directly in front of the camera in medium shot.  “Welcome” Jovic hisses, “speak”, reaching out to the image  to call it forth, as if she was the puppet master pulling the strings.
