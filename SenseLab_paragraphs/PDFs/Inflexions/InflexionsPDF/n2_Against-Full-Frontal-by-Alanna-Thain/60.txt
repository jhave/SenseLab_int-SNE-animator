What does it mean to say that I felt “all eyes” during this piece, that this installation performance opened up the back space of the body,  diverging from an intentional, directed notion of understanding and  sense? What is the point  of such a reorientation of the cogito towards a sentio,  to return to Massumi’s terms?
