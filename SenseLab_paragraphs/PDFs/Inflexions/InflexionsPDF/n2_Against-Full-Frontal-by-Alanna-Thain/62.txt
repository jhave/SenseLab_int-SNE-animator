“I’m back from death”: Fabre’s L’ange de la mort asks us to feel that rhythmic edge where unity  is doubled by an unlivable chaos, populated by a shared delirium newly  available to us thanks to the disjunctive effects of the audio-visual archive. This archive takes us beyond the lived body  to an indetermination of subject, object and relational milieu.   Fabre’s simple  reorientation of spectatorial coordinates in the installation design of L’ange de la mort, subtly but effectively amplifies the relation/ non-relation between the seen and the said, participating in an emergent alterfication of spectatorial habit. The ethico-aesthetic drive  of the piece reanimates the potential Benjamin  saw in cinema  as the art of the mass and of a distracted attention: how do we feel these “partial subjectivities” of a “cinematic body” as the potential of the crowd? If we think  of the difference between cinema  and dance  as one of degree rather than  kind  (two arts of movement rather than  an art of liveness versus one of record), than  this type of intermedial dance  performance opens  us to a different mobility we can only partially incorporate--the (feeling?) of a partial subjectivity that we see
thematized and embodied in Jozic and  Forsythe’s performances . Back from
death. Still here. In the blue.
