Let us  take  a closer  look  at  the  way  in  which  Zurita performs the  monstrous female   homunculus;  how   her  dance   proposes  a  vitalist   critique  of scientific/Cartesian   dogmas.  Let  us   follow   for   a  moment  the   movements expressed by the dance,  and  then  in particular the way in which  they  allow  us to escape  from the strategies of power, the discourses Zurita plays  with.  To start we should keep   in  mind that,   in  line  with   Foucaultâ€™s  late  writings,  the  earthly wooden square is the heavenly elastic circle that  does  not limit the dancer in the way  she  moves  but  rather opens  up  a  (spatial/spatiotemporal)  way  of  being (creating a  topological rather than  a  geometrical space).  Refusing the anthropocentric perspective, we should thus  not start our analysis by stating that the  dancer moves  or dances inside the  cube.  Rather,  it is with the  cube  that  the dance  takes  place,  as  everything acts  in  its  togetherness. The  infinitely hollow surface/volume with  which  the camera confronts us does  not function according to the  idea  that  two  outsides of bodies  can be related to one  another. Rather,  it functions through enfolding. It shows  us that  movement never  takes place on the outside of a body,  but  comes  from  within, from  how  the  body,  that  is always multiple, and  has the greatest depths, unfolds itself with  the camera. The sadistic camera that is capable of opening up a threshold of perception, once more  allows for  a multitude of com-pli-cations, du-pli-cations and  re-pli-cations that  create the morphogenesis of the real.
