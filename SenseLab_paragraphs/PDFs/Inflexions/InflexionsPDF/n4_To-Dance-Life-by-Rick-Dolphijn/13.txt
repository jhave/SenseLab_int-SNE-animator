dance   takes  place.  We  claim  however that  it  is through  dance that  bodies   are created. We say that  dance  is about  the play  of forces as it creates  the sensations through which  bodies  of the performer, of the cube, of the spectator, and  of all of them   together (there   is  no  reason to  believe   that  particular pleats   of  matter cannot be part  of several  bodies  at the same  time) are being formed. That is what dance  is about  â€“ the creation of the singular body/bodies in correspondence with the singular space/spaces (and  time/times, as we will find out later).
