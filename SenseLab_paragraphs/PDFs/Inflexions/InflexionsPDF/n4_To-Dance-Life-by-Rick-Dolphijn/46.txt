The drool  is thus  not  the  medium through which  cannibalism transports itself, that  connects the devouring self to the  devouring other,  sucking life out  of both of  them.   The  drool   reveals   cannibalism. It  reveals   the  mouth as  the  locus  of creation where matter is being  formed, or chewed upon. Where  life shows  itself as “nothing more  than  the process of always-productive becoming” (Colebrook,
2008: 64). In  this  performance, and  especially in  this  third part,  where we  are shown how  life  eats  life  in  the  first  place,  a  true  alternative to  humanism is offered  to us.  It is a truly  Brazilian  aesthetic, a Brazilian  vitalism in continuous composition in the mouth.
