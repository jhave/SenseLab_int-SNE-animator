In the preceding letter,  Oiticica explained how  this movement is in a way conceptualizing Brazil by referring (“especially”) to Oswaldo de Andrade’s 1928
Manifesto  Antropofágica and   the  way   here   too  a  move   away   from  rationalist Europe (=humanism) is being performed. The title of Clark’s performance makes a more  than  obvious reference to this timely  manifesto, but in many  more  ways, this  pamphlet can  help  us  to understand what  goes  on  in the  performances of Clark  and  also of Zurita. Even more,  turning out  to be the opening statement of Brazilian  modernism, de Andrade’s manifesto opened up  an important critique on European aesthetic dominance and  turned out  to be of the greatest influence not only in South American art but also in the political  routes taken  since.
