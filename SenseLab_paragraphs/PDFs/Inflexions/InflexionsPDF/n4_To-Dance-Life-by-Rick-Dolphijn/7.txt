When  the  last corset  is removed, the  camera has  arrived at its final frontier: the living  skin.  Once  covered up,  given  a façade  by the  lifeless  corsets  intended to provide the body  with  an identity (sexual,  cultural, social), with  a structured and captured self that  finds  itself in opposition to the outside that  it escaped, the skin always already re-moves the  images  projected  into  it. It shows  itself  as a most unstable surface,  nervously in  movement because of breathing, because of the muscular structures that  connect  it to the  various living  bodies  its houses, and most  of all because we all know  that  the skin is much  more  than  an organ  of the body.  The skin  is the  fold  to the  nth  degree. The skin  desires the  out  to come  in and  the in to go out.  The skin,  upon closer  inspection, is a Sierpinski carpet  that seems  to be a surface,  or, in terms  of the  body  it surrounds, a volume. But it is covered with  holes  that  are surrounded by other  holes  ad  infinitum, making its total   surface/volume  approach  zero.   By  undoing  the  body   of  its  harnesses (corsets)  and  by zooming in upon the  ongoing metamorphoses of the  skin,  the camera, as ever,  searches “to  withdraw into  the  recesses  of a world” (Leibniz, quoted  in  Deleuze  [1988]  1993:  9).  We  approach  the  skin  infinitely  closely. Darkness encloses  us. The (phallic)  camera folds  itself  into  the  belly,  the  navel, the centre  of the world.
