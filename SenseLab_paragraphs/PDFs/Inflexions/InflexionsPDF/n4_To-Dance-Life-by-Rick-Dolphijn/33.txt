Lygia  Clark  herself  once  had  a dream in  which  an  anonymous substance was churning out  of her  mouth, leading to the  loss  of her  inner  substance. It is the End of Man. She turned this into what  would probably be one of her most  well- known performances, Baba Antropofágica. In it, the  participants who  used  to be mere  observers (in this  case, students of hers  at the  Sorbonne where she taught for a while),  placed small  spools  of colored thread in their  mouths, unwinding them  directly onto  another of  the  participants who  lay  on  the  floor.  We  can translate Baba Antropofágica as “Cannibalistic Drool”  – the collective  vomiting of lived  experience which  was  then  swallowed by others,  as she herself  must  have described it (Osthoff,  1997: 283). Creating bodies  from bodies,  by eating  them,  by dissolving them  through the mouth.
