The inside  of the  belly,  the  womb, equals  a square made  of wood. This is what the  second scene  tells  us.  And  there  is  a  woman inside   it  – unmistakably a woman, of course.  But this  time  the  mask  does  not  capture her,  signifying the way  her  body  is held  captive, enclosing and  molding it into  a defined set  of expressive traits.  There  is a mask  involved, but  its function is entirely different from  how  it (together with  the corsets)  acted  in the first scene.  Now  the mask  is made  up  of a cluster  of heads, with  all sorts  of facial expressions. It also leaves the  mouth uncovered. Sometimes the  dancer extends her  head  with  an artificial leg.  Even  more  so  than  in  the  first  scene,  we  are  reminded of the  monstrous births  that  still  haunt the  female  body.  Or,  in  more  contemporary terms,  the teratomas, as  Stacey  mentions them:  “cancers of the  germ  cell (the  egg  or  the sperm), [that]  mimic  ‘the beginning of life’ with  apparently authentic authority” (Stacey, 1997: 91). Or the deviant fetus  that  threatens the body  of the mother, yet is  unmistakably produced by  it,  a  part  of  it.  Braidotti adds  to  this  that  “the constitution of teratology as a science offers a paradigmatic example of the ways in which  scientific  rationality dealt  with  differences of a bodily  kind” (Braidotti in Stacey, 93). This deformity, this abnormality which  is of the female  body,  turns grotesque in the stage version of Das Partes (which  is a name  the artist  chooses  to give to a series of processes and  not to this particular project). Here,  the extension of the head  has not only itself grown spectacularly (reaching to the ceiling  of the theatre, easily  ten meters), it also seems  to have  over-coded her entire  body  with a cluster  of limbs and  faces. The extension then  almost  suffocates the dancer with
