The drool  in Clark  is by all means  a cannibalistic drool  that  encloses  the  Other, the  totem  as  Freud conceptualized it. In Totem and Taboo, Freud states  ([1913]
2001: 3), “What  is a totem?  It is as a rule an animal (whether edible  and  harmless or  dangerous and  feared)   and  more  rarely  a  plant  or  a  natural phenomenon (such  as rain  or water), which  stands in a peculiar relation to the  whole  clan”. The Other  is then  obviously the European, the father  that  needs  to be controlled, silenced, of which  the  mouth needs  to be shut.  The drool,  churning out  of the mouths, spins  a thread around Europe, performing an  animist ritual  in which indeed a self is lost  through a devouring of the  Other.  Yet in emphasizing the other,   in  placing the  other   (the  European) at  the  centre   of  attention, Clark’s reading of de Andrade is political  and  critical.
