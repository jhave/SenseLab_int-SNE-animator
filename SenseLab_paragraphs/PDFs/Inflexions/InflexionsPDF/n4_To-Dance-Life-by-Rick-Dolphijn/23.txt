Only by allowing dance  to be worthy of the event  do the bodies  involved set themselves to an infinite creation of a space-time manifold. Do not  criticize  this by  claiming that  a body  when captured in  a cube  is not  able  to  stand up,  to stretch in full, to walk  or to run.  We should not  think  of the  body  outside of its situation as  a premise of all bodily  action,  as  Merleau-Ponty taught us  a long time  ago  (for instance, 1945: chapter 1).  Neither should we  ascribe  all kinds  of qualities to “a cube”,  as if it is a ready-made, static  entity  simply placed into  a performance  (and   taken   out  again).   Let  us  not  fall  back  into  this Kantian/Cartesian  idea  of  space  and  time  as  already existing   categories that locate and  capture life in four dimensions. Let us accept  that  “[we] are caught up in the  world and  we  do  not  succeed in extracting ourselves from  it in order to achieve  consciousness of the  world” (Merleau-Ponty, 1945: 5). And  if we cannot extract  ourselves, we  should certainly not  extract  a  cube,  an  Other,   from  the world, as Derrida so often  told  us. Let us accept  that  the  living  subjects  and  the lived  objects  come  to life in this  situation, in this  performance. The microdance that  we  are  conceptualizing  here  then  in  the  end  proposes a  thorough anti- dogmatism that  always already starts  with,  as the Argentinian pop  group the Babasonicas, in their  song  “Microdancing”, keep  repeating:  “No esperes nada de mí, no esperes nada de mí (Do not expect anything from me, do not expect anything from me)” (2008). For, instead of expecting, of projecting our ideals  onto the real, we should map  the speeds-and-slownesses that  give form to the contents and expressions that are the event.
