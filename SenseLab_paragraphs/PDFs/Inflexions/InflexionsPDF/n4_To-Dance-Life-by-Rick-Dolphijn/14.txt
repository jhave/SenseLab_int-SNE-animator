This  must   be  the  reason why  Zurita chose  to  name   a  series  of  performative experiments Das Partes. Das Partes (from  Portuguese to English)  should be transcribed “from  or about  the  parts”. It refers  to the  various performances, to the parts  of which  they  consist,  but of course  most  of all to how  in the dance  the partiality of the objects, the unformed matters about  to be mater-ialized, about  to be in-volved, is always already at stake.  It first of all seems  to propose a type  of performance  in  which   an  inside,   folded  from   an  outside,  is  created  as  an immanent intraconnected set of series. Thus we should not have  talked about  an extra  leg, as if added to an already existing  head,  or a series  of limbs  and  body parts  as if they  were  “extra” to  the  body  of the  dancer. Starting with  force  or movement, with  a Bergsonian Élan vital, we should rather have  set to mapping how  new  conglomerates, new  bodies  of bodies,  come  into  being  in  the  event. This is why  Manning starts  her  book  Relationscapes by stressing that:  “There  are always two  bodies” (2008:13) when it comes  to  a dance.  At  least  two  bodies, never   one,  and   it  is  always relational movement  that  is  involved. Thus,  we should set ourselves to opening up to the intensities as they  come about  between the bodies,  creating a zone of life that is relayed with  the various tactics and  their consequent enfoldings through which  the  performance enters  processes of movement.
