Even more  so than  with  Lygia Clark, the third part  of Das Partes for Video is about the creation of life. With Zurita too, the dancing of the body  parts  in the mouth is also accompanied by drool.  This time,  however, the  drool  is not  represented by colored threads. This  time  there  is no  obvious reference to a Freudian Dream. This  time,  the  drool   has  to  emerge from  the  dancing,  from  the  movements themselves: they  do not take place in the mouth, but they do in a sense create  the mouth. This third scene then  rewrites the second scene not so much  by turning it inside  out,  which  would imply  that  the organic (the body  of the dancer) and  the inorganic (the box, the dummy, the plastic  body  parts)  have  switched places.  On the  contrary, the  third scene  bears  the  same  genetic  algorithm as the  second. Its morphogenesis is one of topological (scholastic) self-similarity in which  the drool proves able  to reveal  life as a necessity of the micro- or nanodance. Clark  has  said that her performances were  by no means  pleasurable. Here,  with  Zurita, the pain that   comes   with   the   loss   of   inner   substance,  expressed  by   the   drool,   is accompanied  by   the   pleasure  of  creating  an   inner   substance,  creating  the impossible. For now  we see the  subterranean, Heidegger’s earth,  as the  various micro-  or  nanodances assemble the  body  from  the  various parts  that  dance the mouth. Even  more  so than  with  the  second scene,  this  scene  (per)forms life as it shows   us  its  origin,   the  locus  where it  is  both  destroyed and   created –  the mouth… that drools.
