All of a sudden the  dancer is confronted with  a dummy of a female  body,  and immediately throws herself  at it. Instead of critiquing sexual  difference, anthropocentrism and  subjectivity, in which  the codes  and  signs  and  powers are being  questioned, Zurita now  moves  to an  affirmation of sexual  differing, to a philosophy of the pure  event,  to desire  or appetite, in which  affects, forces and an absolute instead of a relative metamorphosis create  the  performance. This time there  is no search  for an  inside  of the  body,  a biological essence,  a gender or a humanity. The third scene  offers  us  the  body  of the  dancer in more  or less the same  position from  which  the  performance started (again  stressing the  (fractal) self-similarity of the  whole  project).  Yet now,  the  entire  performance is reterritorialized upon the  mouth.  Replacing the  Vitruvian navel  as  the  centre from  which  the world unfolds, the mouth offers us a new  way of thinking about humanity without opposing the  inside  to the  outside, thus  there  is no  need  to “undo” our  humanist legacy  (as,  for  instance, Butler  proposes this).  Without having as the ideal  to unfold the  world according to the  contours of the  human body,  or having to critique it, the mouth opens  up the inside  and the outside, the subject   and   the  object,  allowing  us  to  start   from  between.  The  mouth then rewrites humanity from the point  of relationality.
