by choosing the dance  instead of the mute  corpse,  movement instead of being,  an affirmative creation of  the  body  instead of  a  capturing, Zurita’s rewriting of Brazil actually turns out  to be very  different from  Clark’s. Zurita does  not  need the Other,  the projection, in order to decompose the self, because she knows that eating  is not about  the capturing of the other  but about  a necessary and  ongoing metamorphosis of the  self.  Although de  Andrade’s  manifesto also  calls  for  an eating  or  a devouring of Europe, it is not  so much  through the  creation of an Other  that  he proposes to move  away  from  the  self. On the  contrary, his move away   from  humanist Europe is  not  done  by  creating an  opposition (the  self versus the other)  but  by being  the parasite, by the simple  act of traversing. That is why  de  Andrade can  say:  “We  have  never  had  grammar… We were  never baptized” (27 March,  1920).   Therefore, Zurita does  not  allow  the  totem  to  be seen  in  another particular relation to  the  self,  but  always already part  of  the event,  of the dance,  a plural part of the multiplicity of “parts” that comes to being in the event.  It is animal or plant  in that  it is always an escape  from  humanity. It is desire.  It is affect. It is the drool.
