Although  also   definitely  interested   in   the   body,    Clark’s   anthropophagic vomiting, especially as it captures an-Other human body  is a political  manifesto, whereas  Zurita’s drooling  microdance is  a  purely  aesthetic experiment. It  is relative movement as opposed to absolute movement. It is a body  politics  instead of a desire  to find out what  the mouth can do. Clark, like Gunew, is in search  of a second tongue, a  subterranean  otherness that  resists  the  force  feeding of the mother, as it is enveloped (in later  life) with  language (see Gunew, 2005). Clark thus  has to vomit,  has to get the intruder (the food, the language) out of her body in order to cleanse  herself.  In her  correspondence with  Hélio  Oiticica,  she  thus explains  the   need   for   spectators:   “Each   day   I  lose   more   of  my   apparent personality,   entering   into    the    collective    in    search    of   a   dialogue   and accomplishing myself  through the spectator” (Clark and  Oiticica, 2006: 115).
