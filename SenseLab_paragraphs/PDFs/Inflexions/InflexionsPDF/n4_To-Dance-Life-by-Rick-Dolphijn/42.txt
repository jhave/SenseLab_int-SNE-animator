manifesto  of  the  mouth  that   proposes  to  eat  the  rationalist madman  (Galli Mathias) the  same  way  Latin(o)  culture (coming  from  European heritage) eats the “traditional” cultures (Amerindian, African)  and  law in general. De Andrade knows his  Freud (especially Totem and Taboo of course),  Marx  and  Breton,  and reterritorializes them  into the mouth, not so much  criticizing them  but devouring them.   Also  he  parasitizes  Picabia’s  Manifeste  cannibale dada, turning ultimate nihilism  into   a  vitalist   program  that   urges   Brazil  not  so  much   to  be  anti- European, but to turn  away  from  culture and  civilization (as defined by Europe) as a whole.  That is why  he celebrates primitivism, notably the Tupi  Indians, traditionally known (in European literature) for their  cannibalism. His emphasis then   on  devouring  whatever  one   is  affected   by  in  the  end   encourages  art (Brazilian  art, that is) to traverse Native, European, African  and  Asian cultures as they  are  always already in  Brazil.  De  Andrade thus  promotes a  naivety that absorbs or traverses, not creating a style  or a movement but  a spirit,  a Brazilian spirit  that  calls  for  a  creativity that  is  not,  as  with  European modernism, so strongly connected to a chronology, to a celebration of “the  new”  as opposed to the old.
