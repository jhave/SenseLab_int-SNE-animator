us.  Two  hands  start   peeling  off  a  series   of  meat-colored  corsets,   willingly accepting the  cameraâ€™s  pornographic (as Haraway would call it (1988)) urge  to search  for  an  inside,  for  how  the  outside surfaces fold  in,  creating the  screen upon which  our  world can be projected. The camera, as always, is a sadist,  with the  eternal desire  to separate a whole  into  parts.  It is a mechanistic instrument, that,  although able to move  in all directions, is itself only  interested in zooming in, as Eisenstein has told  us so often.  For is it not strange that  zooming out  only takes  place  at the  end  (sometimes of a scene,  mostly  of a film)? Zooming out  is the   restoration  of  the   romantic  ideal.   It  has   nothing  to  do   with   art,   with aesthetics.  Quite   the  opposite,  it  upholds the  idea   of  representation,  of  the doubled world which  we are now  about  to leave.  This camera is honest, true.  It knows that its only way is to the inside,  into the world.
