Because of the ongoing metamorphosis that makes  up this performance, which  in no way  finds  its origin  in the  human being,  the  big questions (in micro  format) that  haunt this  second scene  especially, deal  with  how  this  move  away  from humanism is  being  established.  Actually at  the  start  of  this  scene,  where the dummy-like figure  of the first scene allows  us to enter  its world though the belly, the  navel,  Leonardo Da Vinci’s Vitruvian man,  that  canonical image  that  can be found at the heart  of humanism, as it dominated thinking in the Western world for   such   a   long   time,   immediately  joins   the   experience.  Inspired  by   the architectural writings of Vitruvius and in particular his idea that the ideal human figure  was  the  principal order of proportion in  all  classical  thoughts on  form, Leonardo suggests capturing  this  geometrical ideal  in  the  two  positions that make  up  the Vitruvian man.  In reference to his artwork, his (few) writings even further explicate the  profound anthropocentrism we see at work  here.  The very first  sentences of his Paragone, his  (edited) philosophy of art,  focus  on  the  idea that  science,  geometry for instance, begins with  the surface  of the bodies  that  has its  origin  in  the  line,  the  border of  that  surface.   Clearly   making reference to Vitruvius’ De architectura (written circa 27 BCE) (Vitruvius 1931: 3.1.2–3), Leonardo’s (perfect)  triangle between art, science  and  truth represents the anthropocentric harmony of forms  that  starts  from  the human contours and  that has enjoyed such  great  popularity in modern times.  Leonardo’s image  is part  of the   same   Modernist  discourse  as   Vitruvius’   ideas   and   the   way   they   set
