to the  next  or to the  previous. We notice  that  there  is a crack  in the  world, as Murakamiâ€™s  Nakata  put   it  so  eloquently  in  Kafka on  the  Shore.  The  minor movements, the smallest gestures that  the  camera reveals  to us, present us with the fractal  nature of space that,  in magnifying even the infinitesimal, creates  new forms   of  expression,  new   blocks   of  sensation  ad  infinitum.   The  continuous questioning of all the relations at stake poses  all sorts of questions. Because of the ever changing intrarelations, the dancer can turn  from a dwarf into a giant  in the shortest period of time, or into an animal, or into a ghost.  This is not because the body  itself of the  dancer is capable of creating a metamorphosis, but  because of the relations at work  in the dance.
