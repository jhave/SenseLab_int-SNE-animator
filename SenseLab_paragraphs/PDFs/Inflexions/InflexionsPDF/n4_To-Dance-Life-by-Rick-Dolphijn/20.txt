Enfolded  within  these   rhythms  are   the   spatio-temporalities  of  relation.  To unravel these,  we  should not  look  at  the  performance in  terms  of it primarily being created by the anomalies of speeding up and  slowing down. Now  we focus on the images  and  the sounds as a system of relationships between its elements- to-come,  creating forms  of succession and  of extension. These forces make  up the two  vortices  central  to the  analysis of dance.  That  being  said,  the  first  thing  to agree  upon in respect of our second analysis is that  these  particular dances by no means  reflect  a series  of studied movements, of steps,  of positions memorized and  stored inside  a  body.  Instead the  body  of  the  dancer opens   up  to  those particular machinic procedures that  the  dance,  the  event,  proposes. It is invited to act beyond the  pure  empirical succession of time  (the  chronological choreography), much  more  interested in an introspection of coexistence and  how that  comes  about.  Thus  when the  hand follows  the  walls  of the  cube,  it is not according  to  a  preset  bodily   ideal   that   the  dance   proceeds:  a  new   relation emerges where the  entire  body  of the  dancer and the cube are  deterritorialized and    undergo  a   metamorphosis.  Manning  adds   to   this:   “As   the   bodies qualitatively metamorphose, so does the relation between the form and  matter of these  bodies” (2004:  89).  What  happens in  the  dance   is  therefore a deterritorialization of everything that  makes  up the body  of the performer, of the cube,  and  of everything else somehow at work  in the  event,  in all their  virtual relations.
