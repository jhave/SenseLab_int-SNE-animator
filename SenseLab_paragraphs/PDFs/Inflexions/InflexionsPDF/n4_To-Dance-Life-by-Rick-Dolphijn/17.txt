Important to the  creation of the  strings of movements here  is the  fact that  this event  has a stutter. It is not a stutter in language. It is not the creation of an extra tongue that  fights  the  imposed major  language, as  Sneja  Gunew speaks   of  it (2004). It is not  a political  linguistic but  rather a materialist aesthetic stutter. It allows    both    the   imagery  and    the   music    to   open    up   an   oblique  four- dimensionality in which  hesitation, fear, desire,  chance  and  power are produced through a returning pleat  creating non-chronological streams. The  pleats  slow these  streams down and  speed them  up,  yet unlike  the razor-sharp stroboscobic bits that make  up the video  art of Antonin de Bemels (see de Bemels, 2009) which seem  to accelerate movement increasingly, Zurita allows  for a taking  back  and forth  of movement, creating continuous gushes on either  side  surrounded by its extremes (we can refer to them  as helicoidal movements).
