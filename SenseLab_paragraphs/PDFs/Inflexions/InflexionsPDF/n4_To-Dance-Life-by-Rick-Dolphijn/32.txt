again. The pieces are being chewed upon as well, or better,  danced with by the soft circle/square of the mouth, through what  is not even a microdance anymore, but a nanodance… This  is what  Brazilian  performance artist  Lygia  Clark’s  call  to structure the  self  is  all  about.   It  is  a  call  for  a  non-humanist  nativity. It  is  a creation of life, which  has to take place in the dark.  In the obscure, in the hidden. That  is why  the  experimental Jews’  harp  group, Trio  Aubergine, considers its music  subterranean; because it is in the mouth, in the unknown, that  they  allow their  instruments to  create  a mechanical expression of the  cavities  of the  head into  the  great  outside which  is  not  outside anymore. The  vital  one,  the  most undefined and flexible cavity being of course,  the mouth.
