In  search   of  the  dynamic  combinations in  this   ongoing  disequilibrium,  the stuttering surfaces and  temporalities, volumes and  soundscapes, do not create  a (harmonic) parallelism but  more  or less evoke  one  another in the  stutter, which then  sets into  movement a non-synchronal rhythm that  pushes the performance forward. The  predominantly  cinematic and  audiovisual rhythmic contents,  are doubled by  this  rhythm that,   in  its  stapling, forms   the  helices,  the  multiple dances, that  only  due  to our  simplest narratology, can be considered as one, the one  total  linear  movement. The various stutters thus  seem  to be caused by the way  the  imagery and  the  music  are  constantly decomposing the  composition enacting a multiplicity of microdances that  overlap one another creating a texture, a  corrugatedness. This  way  a  “synesthesia proper to  vision”   creates  a  visual touch,  as Massumi (2002: 158) names it, followed and preceded by a “synesthesia proper to  hearing”  that   creates   audible  touch.   It  makes   good   sense   to  use Deleuze (and  Guattari)’s  concept “the  haptic”  (Deleuze, [1981] 2003) to  catch what  these textures express, how the stutter itself is a sensation. The stutters thus
