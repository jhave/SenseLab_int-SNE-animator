never  knows  what  might  happen.  The  trick  is  to  get  the  constraints  right.  Affirming  an ecology of the virtual is not therefore a matter of wait and see: this ecology “has to work in order to live, to processualise itself with the singularities which strike it. All this implies the idea of a necessary creative practice and even an ontological pragmatics” (1995: 4). This can sound a little too heroic, as Guattari sometimes does: at the same time, Guattari’s emphasis on activity is never solely a matter of an individual intentional agency. Rather, the kind of creativity about which he writes also operates upon a “ trans-monadic axis, one of transversality” (1996: 167): hence the importance of events such as Dancing the Virtual and Housing the Body.
