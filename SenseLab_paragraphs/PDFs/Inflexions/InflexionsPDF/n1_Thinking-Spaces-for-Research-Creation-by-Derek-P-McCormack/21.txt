The French social-spatial theorist Henri Lefebvre provides some useful orientation here, particularly his interest in reworking the terms in which the relation between bodies and spaces are conceived within western thinking and philosophy. For Lefebvre the former have tended to be rendered as objects moving in and through a kind of three-dimensional geometrical space. Yet the body remains an “enigma” whose secret
at once banal and profound – is its ability, beyond ‘subject’ and ‘object’ (and beyond
the philosophical distinction between them) to produce differences ‘unconsciously’
out of repetitions – out of gestures (linear) or out of rhythms (cyclical). In the misapprehended space of the body, a space that is both close by and distant, this paradoxical   junction   of   repetitive   and   differential   –   this   most   basic   from   of
‘production’ – is forever occurring (1991: 395).
