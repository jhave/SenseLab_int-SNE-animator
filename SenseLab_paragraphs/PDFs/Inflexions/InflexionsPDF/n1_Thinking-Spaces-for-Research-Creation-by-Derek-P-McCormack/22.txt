This   ongoing   generative   production   is   the   basis   for   Lefebvre’s   affirmation   of   the participation of moving bodies in the processuality of thinking-space. And this participation can be prehended through the architectonics of particular practices and sites. For instance, Lefebvre points to the cloister and to “the solemn pace of the monks who walk there” (ibid:
216) as one such site. In the cloister, thinking and moving become articulated through one another in the generation of a distinctive kind of thinking-space, in which the gestural and the symbolic, the localised and the infinite, are co-emergent. Clearly, the thinking-space of the cloister is defined by a certain speed and arrangement of bodies and things. But it is possible to imagine configurations of moving bodies and architecture that move at different speeds. Indeed, Lefebvre’s writing points to the possibility of diagramming thinking-spaces through architectures of anticipation and potential that might facilitate affective relations between and within bodies of various kinds (see also McCormack  2005).
