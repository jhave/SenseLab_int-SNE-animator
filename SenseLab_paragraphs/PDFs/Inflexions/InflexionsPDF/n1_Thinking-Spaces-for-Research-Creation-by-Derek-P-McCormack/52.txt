So, the after-affects of Housing the Body, coupled with an encounter with Nauman’s “space of thought moving” (Lepecki 1991: 30) and Guattari’s diagrammatics might encourage you to make more of abstraction in relation to thinking-space as process and noun. Indeed it might affirm that any attempt to cultivate such thinking-spaces is doomed to failure if it continues to oppose lived immediacy with abstraction. If abstraction is always conceived as a way of extracting thought from the experiential immediacy of the actuality of things in the world then it will always be in deficit to the surplus of a world of lived experience. Yet as Brian Massumi has argued, perhaps the problem with attempts to produce thinking-spaces that take seriously the onto-generativity of moving bodies is not that they are too abstract to grasp the lived, concrete, immediate, fleshy actuality of these bodies, but that they are not abstract enough (Massumi, 2002: 5). In turn, this would depend upon a differentiation of abstraction – or at upon least the recognition that more than one kind of abstraction might participate in the facilitation of thinking-space. The first kind of abstraction can be seen in the lines of a square on the floor, the lines of a diagram in a book. The other is the kind of abstraction pertaining to the movement of thought – a non-localisable assemblage of affects,
