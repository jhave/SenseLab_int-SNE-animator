neighbouring district, but a line that passes through our objects, along which there exists an absolute outside” (Cache 1995: 70). Rethinking site with Arakawa and Gins (2002): site not as fixed location in three-dimensional Euclidean space, but as a differential process through which architectural bodies “field” an environment. Fielding through moving bodies in these terms is not an activity taking-place at a site, but an ongoing multiplicity of positionings in movement. And rethinking the relation between geography and landing sites through the possibility of furnishing, where furniture is, as Cache suggests,
That  object  that  is  directly  connected  to  our  bodies.  For  our  most  intimate  or  most abstract endeavors, whether they occur in bed or on a chair, furniture supplies the immediate physical environment in which our bodies act and react; for us, urban animals, furniture is thus our primary territory. Architecture, object, geography – furniture is that image where forms are fused together (1995: 30).
