Stating upfront such matters of concern can sound like turf-protection or claim-staking – mere disciplinary positioning in relation to certain aspects of the practice and craft of research-creation. Conversely, avoiding the question completely ignores the possibility that disciplinary associations can sometimes work as generative constraints, providing affective orientations and opportunities for cultivating dispositions to think in certain ways. How then to understand disciplinary participation in the more-than-disciplinary practice of research- creation? One way might be to conceive of this participation not so much as an effort to bring certain interests to the table, but of becoming affected and inflected by encounters with and within distinctive kinds of thinking spaces – where thinking-space is both a processual movement of thought and a privileged site at which this movement is amplified and inflected by novel configurations of ideas, things and bodies. What follows therefore is a discussion of how events like Dancing the Virtual and Housing the Body can be understood in terms of this kind of thinking-space: as facilitating environment and generative activity. Along the way I draw particular support from two figures – Henri Lefebvre and Félix Guattari – each of whom highlights the importance of such a conception of thinking-space to the cultivation of ecologies of research-creation.
