Even if he foregrounds questions of space, Lefebvre was all too aware of the need to think the generativity of space and time together: they are, in his words, “distinguishable but not separable” (ibid: 175). The conceptual-pragmatic vehicle through which Lefebvre seeks to grasp this generativity is ‘rhythm analysis’. While it emerges from his longstanding concern with temporality, the importance of rhythm analysis is first outlined in The Production of Space (1991) and developed further, albeit still suggestively, in his last book, parts of which were co-written with Catherine Régulier (Lefebvre 2004). Lefebvre’s writings on rhythm analysis have most often been used to engage critically with the space-times of the urban. But just as interesting is his suggestion, upon which he elaborates little, that the “field of application par excellence [of rhythm analysis], its preferred sphere of experiment, would be the sphere of music and dance, the sphere of ‘rhythmic cells’ and their effects” (1991: 205).
