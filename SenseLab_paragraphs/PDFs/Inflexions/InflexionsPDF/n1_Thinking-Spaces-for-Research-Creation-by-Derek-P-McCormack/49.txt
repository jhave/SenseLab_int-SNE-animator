While watching and thinking you might be reminded of a more general critique of the space of abstraction, articulated by figures including Lefebvre, for whom abstract spatiality functions “objectally”, as a set of things/signs and their formal relationships: glass and stone, concrete and steel, angles and curves, full and empty. Formal and quantitative, it erases distinctions “within and between bodies” (1991: 49). Understood in this way, it is easy to see how abstraction has such a bad name, tarnished as it by a litany of problematic associations: epistemological withdrawal from the world; philosophical dualism; objectification of the body; idealism; commodification; alienation; aesthetic avant-gardism. Conversely, Lefebvre’s writing seems to work against abstraction by affirming the cultivation of techniques of thinking space that valorise the lived experience of the phenomenological body,  foregrounding  more  corporeal  ways  of  knowing  and  feeling.  Read  through  this critique, it would become all too easy therefore to think of Nauman’s choreographic work as rehearsing the problematic associations of abstraction, depending as it does upon the diagramming of a space within which the body moves. And in the process, Nauman’s choreographic abstractions could also be aligned unfortunately with various geographic and
