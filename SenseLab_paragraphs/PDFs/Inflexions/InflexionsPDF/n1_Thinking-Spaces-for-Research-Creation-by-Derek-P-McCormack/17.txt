In a similar vein, William Connolly (2002) has more recently pointed to the importance of techniques of experience and experiment through which thinking can be ‘layered’ with the more than cognitive processes of memory, perception, and affectivity. While he pays particular attention to the value of cinema, Connolly also points – with refreshing honesty and humour – to a range of techniques, including running, walking, music, drinking, and severe whipping. For many, experiment with such techniques merely serves to undermine the serious business of thought: fortunately perhaps, the prospect of such experience is not particularly discomfiting to geography.
