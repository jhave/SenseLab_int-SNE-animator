But what would such activities, and the thinking-spaces of which they are participants, have to do with understanding and reworking the relation between the abstract and the lived? More specifically, how might they complicate the tendency to oppose the abstract to the lived? You might be reminded of the importance of these questions, if, on the day after Housing the Body, you take the opportunity to visit the Montreal Museum of Modern Art. What catches the eye is an exhibition of work by Bruce Nauman, perhaps most famous for his use of neon lighting to create politically charged sculptures and installations. Yet while such work is interesting, it is not the neon, clown-like figures that grab your attention most. More of a lure is a short video piece called Dance or Exercise on the Perimeter of the Square (1967-
8), in which Nauman sidesteps repetitively around a small square in a metronomic fashion. You might sit and watch Nauman doing this for a number of cycles. Marking time, thinking space.
