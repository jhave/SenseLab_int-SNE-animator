The work of Félix Guattari – and his enthusiasm for the creative processuality of a renewed ontological pragmatics – points to various pathways along which Lefebvre’s invitation might be taken further. Guattari’s writing shares a number of important concerns with Lefebvre’s work. Not least of this these is the former’s affirmation of aesthetic practices as part of a necessary renewal of everyday life. Where Lefebvre writes of the ‘sense’ of an orientation through which to transform “the space of the human species – the collective (generic) work of the species – on the model of what used to be called ‘art’” (1991; 442), in Chaosmosis (1995) Guattari enthuses about the possibilities of an “ethico-aesthetic paradigm”. Echoing Lefebvre’s optimism about a range of artistic practices, Guattari also points to the value of “poetry, music, the plastic arts, the cinema – particularly in their performance and performative modalities”(ibid: 91).
