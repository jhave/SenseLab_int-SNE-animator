remain  uncontroversial,  it  is  very  difficult  to  affirm  geography  as  research-creation:  it remains a business of distanced extraction rather than a process in which world participates in the movement of its own becoming. Hence the vehement critique by thinkers including Henri Bergson (2007) and Alfred North Whitehead (1978) of spatialisation as immobilising concretisation. It is certainly fair to say that much spatial thinking – within and beyond geography – has tended to be remarkably un-processual in nature, conceiving of space as a container for action (Thrift 2006). Yet this admission notwithstanding, the critique of spatialisation as perceptual habit does not lead inevitably to a dismissal of talk of space as obscuring apprehension of the real duration of lived time. Too often, the invocation of space is read as a reaching for a kind of familiar comfort blanket disguising an unwillingness to think becoming. But the real force of a certain critique of spatialisation should be to encourage a shift in attention and emphasis to the ontogenetic processuality of space-time (see, for instance, Massey 2005; Thrift 2006). This is a vision of worlds in composition through a multiplicity of processually resonant space-times. Furthermore, this is a vision in which temporality no longer has a monopoly on questions of the creative. Rather than space as a passive background for the dynamism of time, space-time becomes an ongoing process of heterogeneous, generative creativity without a transcendent creator. And in this vision, the world participates creatively in the folds of which thinking-space consists before individual agency or intentionality gets to work.
