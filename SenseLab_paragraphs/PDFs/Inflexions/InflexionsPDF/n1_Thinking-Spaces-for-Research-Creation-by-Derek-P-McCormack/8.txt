Research-creation is, of necessity, more-than-disciplinary. Yet it is often inflected by experience of the loosely concatenated set of associations between habits of thinking, research techniques, and ethico-political orientations that we call ‘discipline’. This essay explores the relation between research-creation and one such set of associations: geography. In some sense it rehearses an answer to a kind of question often asked at research-creation events such as Dancing the Virtual and Housing the Body. The question can be stated very simply – Geography? And a provisional answer is relatively easy to begin formulating: one only need to point to various matters of concern (Latour 2004) – in which geography has investment without exercising anything like a monopoly – that throw into sharp relief some of the challenges and opportunities of research-creation.
