The key thing is that this is a call for participation rather than paper presentation. Blessed relief. But how might you respond to such a call? You might respond tentatively, outlining not so much a plan of action, but a sense of an ethos of openness: one guided by a notion of presumptive generosity to a world at which there are myriad sites through which to cultivate affectively imbued ethico-political dispositions (Bennett 2001; Connolly 2005b). Tentatively: because it is not at all clear what might or what can or what could happen during such an event; because it is not quite clear how such happening might take place, how it might be facilitated; and because even if it is creative, it is not clear in what sense this really is
‘research’. Tentatively: because “tentativeness, which produces out of its own generative chaos the possibility of a firm or definite sense of things, needs to receive directions” (Arakawa and Gins 2002: 45) or, at the very least, a degree of constraint. And as things turn out, constraint is provided in different ways: by close readings opening onto dancing with José Gil (1988); by string, fabric, baubles becoming material catalysing relational movement; by concepts becoming strange affective attractors; by relational movement exercises becoming movements of thought (Manning 2006).
