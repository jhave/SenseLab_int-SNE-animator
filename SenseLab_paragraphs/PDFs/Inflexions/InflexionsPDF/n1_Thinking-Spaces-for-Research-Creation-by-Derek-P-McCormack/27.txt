Guattari’s ideas about the ritornello as a way of prehending the generative processuality of thinking-space clearly owe much to his thinking-with Deleuze. But they are also informed by his experience of particular environments of facilitation. Most obvious in this regard is La Borde, a therapeutic clinic established by Jean Oury to offer an alternative to the dominant model of psychiatric treatment, by drawing upon, amongst others, the transformational potentials of social, political and aesthetic practices. There is much to Guattari’s relation to La Borde, certainly too much to discuss here. What is important in the context of this essay however, is Guattari’s depiction of the ethos of La Borde in terms of the establishment of an environment in which to revalorise the relational affectivity of very ordinary contexts, thereby facilitating transformations in what he calls “processual subjectivities.”   What exactly does this mean? Guattari provides hints in his depiction of the kitchen at La Borde. While it is the site of all sort of repetitive behaviours, the kitchen can also “come to life”, becoming “a little opera scene: in it people talk, dance and play with all kinds of instruments, with water and fire, dough and dustbins, relations of prestige and submission” (1995: 69). In turn, such activities have the potential to “trigger an existential agglomeration, a drive machine”, which “will have an influence on the people who participate in its activities or are just passing through” (ibid).
