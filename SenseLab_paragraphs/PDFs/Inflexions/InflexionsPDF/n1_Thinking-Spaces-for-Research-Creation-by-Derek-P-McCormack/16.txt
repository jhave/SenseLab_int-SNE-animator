It is one thing to affirm a movement from the grammar of disciplinary extraction to that of participation in a world that already participates in us before we think about it. It is another to work this affirmation into the practice and craft of research. Thankfully, there is a long, if minor philosophical tradition in which experience and experiment are valorised as necessary elements of thinking (see Connolly 2006). Somatic practices have often figured in this tradition, as the writings of philosophers as diverse as Rousseau (1979) and Irigaray (2002) reveal. The pragmatist philosopher John Dewey is particularly interesting in this respect. Specifically, Dewey’s (1989) participation in the Alexander Technique can be understood in terms of a concern with resituating thought within an expanded sensing-space of philosophical and aesthetic experience. For Dewey, participation in such techniques shifts the emphasis from explaining the nature – or the ‘what’ – of experience through application, to the process of “experiencing, the method of its course, the how of its changes” (1958:
235). Admittedly, Dewey’s affirmation of experience can all too easily be read as advocating a kind of somatic self-care as a vehicle for social renewal. But if leavened by the radical empiricism of William James it points to the importance of experimenting with techniques of thinking that move through “fields of experience [that] have no more definite boundaries than have our fields of view. Both are fringed forever by a more that continuously develops, and that continuously supersedes them as life proceeds” (1996: 71).
