It is useful then to distinguish between two kinds of disciplinary grammar. The first, thinking about space designates an epistemological after-awareness of processuality, a second-order derivative activity, always kicking in just a little too late to capture the ontogenetic movement of thought. In this grammar, the logics of creation are often subservient to those of critique. In contrast, thinking-space might be better understood as the co-intensive sensing, in affective-dynamic terms, of the creative processuality of something in the world forcing us to think: that which, as Deleuze puts it, “is fundamentally an object of encounter rather than recognition” (1994: 139). Thinking-space in these terms is not opposed to critique, but affirms the possibility that critique often depends on techniques of sensing-space-time that move at different speeds than allowed for by the habits of contemplation. Or put otherwise, thinking-space in process begins with an acknowledgement that “cognitive experience must originate within that of a non-cognitive sort” (Dewey 1958: 23).
