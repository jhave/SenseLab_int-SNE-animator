Again, like Lefebvre’s discussion of the cloister, Guattari’s kitchen vignette points to the generative capacities of rather mundane spaces: no more than rhythm analysis, the aesthetic paradigm outlined in Guattari’s final work is open to the inventive potential of a range of sites and environments. The key point is that despite some differences in their theoretical orientation, both Lefebvre and Guattari point to the importance of the refrain of thinking- space  as  both  process  and  noun:  with  respect  to  process  it  is  about  inflecting  thinking through affective encounters of different degrees of intensity; and with respect to the latter it is about producing facilitating contexts – sites of experience and experiment for thinking relations between bodies, concepts, and materials of various kinds.
