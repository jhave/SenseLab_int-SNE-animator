But as you sit and watch it, Nauman’s video might work to agitate this critique and to problematise the opposition between the abstract and the lived. Certainly, if Lefebvre can speak of the cloister as a space in which moving bodies become generative of a contemplative thinking-space, then Nauman’s walk around the perimeter of the lines of a square might also be understood as a thinking-space. As André Lepecki writes, “this is the thought-space Nauman builds when he starts not only to ‘pace in his studio’, but to carefully execute extremely  precise  walks:  around  perimeters  of  squares,  revolving  on  one  foot,  square- dancing in patterns” (2006: 30). Curiously, these exercises around the perimeter of a square might remind you of other diagrams: those produced by Guattari, and particularly one contained in an essay called “Ritornellos and existential affects” (1996: 163). While not obviously choreographic, the lines of Guattari’s diagram constitute a thought-, or thinking- space, and you might imagine thinking wandering around its semiotic vectors in ways that are always more than representational.
