Similarly,  considering the exotic behavior exhibited by the vibration of the plate, it is tempting to make  explanations. Models  come to mind. When  the plate  shifts from  one mode  of response to another, I am reminded of the basins  of attraction from   the   mathematics  of  chaos.   Perhaps  some   shift   at  the   molecular  level accounts for the residual disposition effect, something akin to a change in temperature.  Can   a  build-up  and   transfer  of  energy  from   the  plate   to  the environment  and   back   again   be   accounted  for   by   the   theory  of  coupled oscillators?  Each of these  might  be investigated further; however, it might  also be that the value  of these behaviors lies not in the “finger” of physics, but what  it is “pointing at” in epistemology.
