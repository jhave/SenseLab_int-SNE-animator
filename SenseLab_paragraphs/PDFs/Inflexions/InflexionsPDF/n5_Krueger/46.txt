A second assumption is that of a linear  causality, that is, that the signal  will cause and  control  the  behavior. It does  not.  A signal  applied to  the  steel  is not  the driver of this  activity.  In fact, it was  the  response of the  steel—inappropriate to the  immediate task  of infrasound, the  “but  it sure  sounded interesting”—that began  it all and  that  motivated the  continuation of this  work.   So from  another perspective, it is entirely valid  to see the  output as the  causal  agent,  should one choose  to  do  so.    However, to  substitute one  causal  vector  for  another is  to entirely miss the point.
