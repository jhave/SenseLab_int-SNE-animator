Things  happen in their  own  time,  and  the temporal framing of our  observations may   preclude  our   experiencing  them   and   thereby  circumscribe  our understanding. It may be that many  things are not apprehended because there is too little cultural value  placed on patience. Even with  all my experiences with  the plate,  in fact because of them,  I would have  turned this recording off to look for more  “interesting” things.
