The first novel  behavior I noticed was the development of a sequence of distinct and  increasingly energetic phases proceeding from  a barely  audible hum  to the convulsive  shaking  of   sound-effects  thunder.  The   plate   contains  a   broad spectrum of frequencies that  cancel  and  reinforce in complex ways.    My sense was  that  there  was  a capacitance for frequencies within the  plate,  some  kind  of storage mechanism that  would build  up enough energy in a certain  frequency to shift  the  plate  into  the  new  vibrational mode.  In the sound file 38hz, 7.5 minutes these  transitions can  be  heard at  1:50, 3:35, 5:08, and  5:43 and  can  be  visually
identified on the amplitude plot in illustration 1.
