If I examine the  first  phase, in which  little  appears to happen, I can  detect  an increase in  a  higher frequency just  before  the  phase ends.  I can  hear  this  by listening in close succession to two  segments separated in the original recording by several  seconds (this can be heard in sound file ComparisonA.mp3). It may be that the expression of this frequency gives some clue as to the state of the plate  as it shifts  towards or into  another phase.  Other  changes can  be found through a similar    process  of   inspection  or   comparison,  but   for   me,   this   additional examination has yielded only a more fine-grained level of description. This descriptive  activity   can   be   continued,  perhaps  infinitely,  but   there   is  no implication of causality in any  of the  shifts  that  I have  observed. I had  what  I thought was  a very  simple  condition—a suspended  steel  plate  perturbed by  a simple   and   stable   frequency  at  constant  amplitude—but  the   results  varied greatly. The  apparent organization or  structure of its  behavior at  a variety of scales surprised me.
