A tacit assumption that  underlies the unexpectedness of the activity  of the plate that  has been found during these  observations is the primacy of information and the  assumed  passivity of  the  material.   In  this,  it  recalls  the  assumption of substrate independence in both  studies of artificial  intelligence and  artificial  life. Tom Ray’s Tierra is regarded by some  to actually be a living  system, instantiated in silicon  rather than  in organic compounds. Another example might  be Doug Lenat’s CYC, which  attempted to ground an intelligent system by the brute  force incorporation  of  “all”   human  knowledge.  And   unfortunately,  much contemporary work  within my  own  discipline of architecture is trapped in an understanding that  retains a significant conceptual debt  to the primacy of information over the material. This tradition is a long one in western culture, but one that is losing its vigor.
