If I frame  the consideration of the plate  in terms  of an input to a physical system and  its consequently surprising behavior, I look for explanations of the behavior within the  realm  of physics. But if I choose  the  frame  differently, I consider the system  to  be  a  black  box  to  which   the  input  is  frequency, amplitude  and expectation and  the  output is surprise. Now  in  that  case,  I would look  to  the understanding that  I bring  to  the  situation and  the  understanding that  I take away.
