This project  grew  out  of interest in sensory substitution, and  speculations that  it may  be possible to use  these  same  principles to open  the  human sensorium to additional phenomena such  as magnetic fields  by means  of prosthetic interfaces (Krueger 2007). The attempt to build  such devices  is grounded in the frameworks developed  as   alternatives  to   the   information-based  cognitivist  or computationalist perspectives that  have  dominated studies of cognition and perception (Krueger 2006). Variously referred to as skill-based, enactive, or embodied, some theories of cognition acknowledge the active role of the agent  in the  activity  of perception and  the  active  role  of the  environment in  cognition.
