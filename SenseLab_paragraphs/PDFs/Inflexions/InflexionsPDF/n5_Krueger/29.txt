welderâ€™s  table  where I often  work  while  the  plate  vibrates in the  background. Frequently after  a long passage of identical behavior, I noticed that  the sound of the   plate   would  change  exactly   when  I   was   about    to   leave   the   room. Furthermore, if I returned to the  worktable, it would return to its old  routine. Convinced that its behavior had  stabilized once again,  I would head  for the door, and  again  the  sound would shift  just  as I got  to it. If I remained at the  table,  I noticed that  this did  not occur when others  left the room  and  so, the explanation became   clear.  The  small  vestibule-like space  formed by  a  shelving  unit   had unique acoustic   properties and  I was  mistaking my  change in  position for  a change in the plate.
