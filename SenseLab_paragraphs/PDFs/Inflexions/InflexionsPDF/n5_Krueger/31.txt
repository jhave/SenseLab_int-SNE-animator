It is far from  certain  what  aspects or conditions of the  prior  configuration may have  played a role. The lower  fiberboard box on which  the apparatus rested may have  coupled to the  wooden floor,  creating below  the  floor  a resonant chamber much  like  the  body  of  a  musical instrument.  The  scale  of  that  chamber isn’t known. The  steam  pipes  run  in a crawl  space  beneath the  entire  building and continue on  to others;  perhaps it was  only  the  reflection of the  sound from  the floor   back   onto   the   plate   that   influenced  the   behavior,  or   the   occupant’s movements on the floor itself. Maybe  the new  effect is not due  to what  the floor did, but what  the concrete does.
