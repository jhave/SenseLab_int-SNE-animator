Our scientific training, modified as it may be by years of experience in cybernetics, pushes us always towards attempts at analysis. I tell myself  repeatedly that  this  thing  is a black  box in whose  transfer functions I am not interested. Yet I repeatedly try to isolate experimental effects (â€¦). I do not  want  to do this,  but  I do it. The reason  is,  of  course,   that   although  one   can   see   experimental techniques  for   handling  the   total   system  and    measuring  its behavior, the results defy the kinds  of interpretation at our disposal (Beer 1994: 31).
