I  have   a  rather  limited budget  for  my  research  activity   and   have   obtained equipment from  online  auctions, yard  sales, and  discount houses. From  time-to- time some  of the equipment that  I’ve used  has stopped functioning; these  things happen. When  the  sound of a vibrating plate  that  I’d listened to for a long  time suddenly stopped, I assumed that  I’d  “burned-up” yet  another amplifier and went  over  to turn  off the apparatus. But I was surprised to discover first that  the equipment continued to  function, and  then  to  see  that  the  plate  continued to move,  but now emitted (almost)  silence instead. The plate  produced its own anti- sound, perhaps.
