unexpected things happened to the plates.  I had  a simple  steel plate  with  simple perturbations and   from  it  I  expected a  simple   result.   I  was  educated about vibrational  modes using   illustrations  of  the  classic  Chladni patterns  [3]  and expected vibration to be coherent, predictable, and beautiful. This was not to be. The  physical setup for  this  work  consisted of a stand made  of two  fiberboard open  boxes separated by slotted steel angle  posts.  The steel plate  was suspended from  the  upper box  by  a variety of methods, typically a chain  of steel  hooks running from an eyebolt  in the upper box to a drilled hole in the plate.  Neoprene tie-down straps such  as  those   that  hold   tarpaulins in  place  on  trailers, bent threaded rods,   or  recently, much   more   elaborate offset  and   counterbalanced methods  have   also  been   employed.  The  signal   is  supplied  by  a  frequency generator, amplifier and  associated power supply located in an adjacent shelving unit.
