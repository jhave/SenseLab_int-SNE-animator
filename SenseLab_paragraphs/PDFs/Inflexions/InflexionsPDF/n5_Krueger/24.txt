One evening, I had  listened to a long  sequence of phases that  culminated in one that  was  loud,  chaotic  and  apparently  long-lived. I thought it  less  interesting than  the sequence that preceded it. These had  been varied with  a fascinating polyrhythm.  I decided to make  a recording of the  sequence produced by that particular frequency and  amplitude combination before  moving on  to  explore the  behaviors at  others.  I turned off the  apparatus, damped the  plate  and  the support frame,  and  after  configuring the  microphones and  software, I began again.  But the  behavior of the  plate  did  not  begin  again.  Instead, it continued from  its most  recent  phase:  loud,  chaotic  and  apparently stable.    It was  as if it
‘remembered’ in what  state it had been and  picked up about  where it left off.
