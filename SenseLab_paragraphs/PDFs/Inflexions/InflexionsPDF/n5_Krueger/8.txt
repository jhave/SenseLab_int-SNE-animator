This  supposes  that   the   perceivable  is  limited  to  the   range   given.   But  my experiences have  shown me that  this  is far from  the  case.  The infrasonic is not silent,   but   rather  the   frequencies  below   the   range   of  hearing  are   simply perceivable by  some  (perhaps several)   other  means;  the  qualitative difference between those  that  can be heard and  those  that  cannot is subtle.  Evelyn  Glennie, often  considered one  of the  best  solo  percussionists in  the  world, is deaf,  but shows  no  inability in perceiving the  playing of the  musicians that  accompany her.
