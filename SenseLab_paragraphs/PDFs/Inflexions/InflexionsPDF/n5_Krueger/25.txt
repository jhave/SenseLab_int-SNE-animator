On the recording 38hz, 35 minutes, I demonstrate this at time 33:43 (damping and return.mp3). There  is a short  startup phase that  lasts  about  three  seconds, then another ten seconds of chaotic  behavior before  settling into  to a structure that  is remarkably similar  to what  was evident before damping the plate.
