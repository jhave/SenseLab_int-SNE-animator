This manner of working was influenced to a large extent  by my experience of the work  of La Monte  Young  and  Marian Zazeela as installed at the Dream House in New  York. [1] Young’s sound installation, The Base 9:7:4 Symmetry  in Prime Time When Centered above and below The Lowest Term Primes in The Range 288 to 224 with The Addition  of 279 and 261 in Which The Half of The Symmetric  Division  Mapped above and Including 288 Consists of The Powers of 2 Multiplied  by The Primes within The Ranges of 144 to 128, 72 to 64 and 36 to 32 Which Are Symmetrical to Those Primes in Lowest Terms in The Half of The Symmetric  Division Mapped below and Including
224 within The Ranges 126 to 112, 63 to 56 and 31.5 to 28 with The Addition of 119, is a single,  albeit  extremely complex, tone  that  has  been  played continuously for almost  twenty years.  I have  experienced this  work  on  numerous occasions  in sessions  that  have  lasted  up  to four  and  a half  hours. I have  written about  this experience in a paper called  “This is Not Entertainment: Experiencing the Dream House”  (Krueger  2008).  In  addition,  I  have   learned  a  great   deal   from   my colleague Pauline Oliveros and  her practice of Deep Listening. [2] I had  on several occasions  attempted   to   audit   her    course    on    Deep    Listening,   but    my administrative duties  kept   me  from   regular  attendance.  Still,  I  experienced enough to come  away  with  a deep  respect for  this  composer’s  practice and  to understand that  the  focused and  sustained attention directed to  sound could open  possibilities I had  not  imagined. My  experiences with  extended listening did   not  always remain  acute   and   focused  but  varied from  the  intense and directed to benign neglect  and complete boredom.
