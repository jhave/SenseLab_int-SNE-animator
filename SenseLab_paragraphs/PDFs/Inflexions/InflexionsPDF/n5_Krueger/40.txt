will  be found. For example, I began  recording the  plate  one  morning, but  was called  away  unexpectedly. This frequency/amplitude  pair  did  not  result  in the phasing sequence that  is seen in the other  recordings noted here.  It was recorded after  the change of floor and  its behavior is more  typical  of what  occurs  now.   In this  case,  the  activity  was  most  vigorous at the  beginning, but  after  a time  the plate  settled down into a steady hum.  It is as if it takes a while  for all parts  of the plate  to become  organized to vibrate in unison, that  the  plate  sheds  its complex modes of vibration and  falls into a behavioral basin of attraction.  Sometimes this happens, and  when it does,  my  experience has  been  that  it doesnâ€™t change. If I had  been in the room  I would have turned it off long ago, but on that day I could not return for nine  hours.  What  can be seen  on the amplitude plot (9hr run.jpg) is that  the  plate  gradually settles  down to a steady state  after  1:39:38. Nothing happens for five hours. Then,  at 6:40:34 the  behavior changes. In the  sound file
9hr  selections.mp3 I have  recorded a short  segment of the  stable  state  in which the plates  activity  resided for about  five hours. Appended to that is the transition from  that  state  to the more  active  phase that  follows  and  a portion of that  more
dynamic phase. [5]
