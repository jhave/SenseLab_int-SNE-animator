A significant portion of the  unexpectedness of the  activity  of the  plate  detailed here  is  due  to  the  way  in  which   the  set-up is  framed. When  I describe this physical configuration as  a steel  plate  activated by  an  amplified signal  I have already placed the material in a passive and  neutral role and  “information” in an active  one.   If conceptually I understand the  system as a signal  source,  wires,  a transducer and  a sound-producing surface,  I have  recreated exactly  the structure of  the   perceptual  system  models  that   I  have   rejected   in   my   research  on prosthetics. For example, the  signal  source  can  be considered equivalent to the eye, the wires  to the optic nerve,  the transducer to the visual  cortex and  the steel plate   to  the  body,   all  contained within a  workspace. The  correspondence is striking; the structure of these models is identical and  so is their  assumptions and functioning. In  one  we  find  that  the  perceiving organism is  a  passive vessel within and  through which  the agency  of information operates, and  in the other, the  material is expected to respond to the  applied signal,  to co-vary  with  it, but not to take an active  role. This relationship between the body  and  the material is not  due  to  similarities between bodies   and  materials – though there  may  be some.  This  relationship is  entirely a  function of  the  similar   structures of  the models used  to  describe the  two  situations and  by  the  assumptions about  the operation of  agency   within them.   So then  this  is  not  an  attempt to  attribute biological properties to the material, but it is to point  out that something akin to a developmental and  dynamical systems perspectives could  be more  appropriate than  a computationalist view  in the  effort  to understand how  material systems participate within the behaviors that were observed.
