My workspace in the  basement of the  Greene  Building was  once  a classroom.  I often  use the space  for seminars if the class size is small.  It has windows spaced high  in the walls looking out at ground level. It has steam  heat and  maple floors. Both  my  graduate students and  seminar participants  complained of  a  moldy smell  from  time  to  time;  some  said  that  it made  them  ill. At  my  request, the universityâ€™s maintenance personnel came on several  occasions with  their sophisticated air quality sampling gear  to check on the source  of the complaints, but  assured me that  there  was  nothing amiss.   Then  one  day  the  floors  buckled severely due  to  the  continued leaking in  the  steam  pipes  that  ran  below  the floors.   This required the  complete removal of the  contents of the  room  and  the replacement of the floor  with  concrete. The moldy smell  has disappeared. Gone too are many  of the complex behaviors that I had  recorded earlier.
