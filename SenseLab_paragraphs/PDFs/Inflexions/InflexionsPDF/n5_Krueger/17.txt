The first phase is the  quietest, with  a gradual increase in amplitude; the  tone  is steady and  at this point  one is tempted to say that little is happening. That begins to shift  in the  next  phase when the  amplitude generally increases and  there  is a distinct pulsing, although the  amplitude decreases and  the  pluses stretch just before  the  third phase begins.  The third proceeds in a series  of crescendo hums that  last about  three  seconds. They are initially distinct and  cohesive but begin to fracture into sets of shorter pulses. These shorter pulses cohere  into a driving rhythmic structure in the fourth phase that  erupts in the fifth into  energetic and chaotic activity.
