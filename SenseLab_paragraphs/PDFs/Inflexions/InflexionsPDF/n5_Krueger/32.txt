The change in behavior may  not  have  had  to do with  the  floor.   I was  traveling when the floor was replaced and  could  not supervise the removal of the contents of my  workspace.   A signal  generator was  damaged in  the  interim and  while replaced with  a similar  device,  the  new  one  operates on transistors and  the  old on vacuum tubes.  I may not have reassembled the set-up in quite  the same way; I was not able to photograph the apparatus before  it was taken  apart.  Perhaps the hanging mechanisms are  not  isolating, but  couple  in specific  ways  that  in part determine the  behavior of the  system. There  are  as many  explanations for  the change as there  are hypotheses about  how  the  system might  operate.  But what can  be  learned  from   this   sequence  of  events   is  not  more   detail   about   the operation of the system, but a new  understanding of its scope. The system could not  be circumscribed as closely  as I had  previously thought. It certainly is not  a simple  suspended plate  with  a simple  perturbation. Its interest and  its behavior come from its connectedness.
