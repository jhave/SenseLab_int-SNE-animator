Another thing  I learned has  directly to do  with  “interesting” things. I liked  the interesting and  unexpected behavior and  the  way  that  it illuminated errors  or inadequacies in my  tacit  understandings. I have  come  to appreciate the  way  in which  these  occurrences seemed to open  up  possibilities where before  there  had been  standard  answers. Perhaps this  is  simply extending Ranulph Glanville’s notion of  “generosity to  the  world at  large”,  to  what  we  take  to  be  material substance. It may  be that  we are too concerned with  conquering the chaos,  with hammering it  into  the  frameworks that  we  know   as  understanding. We  can explain this.  Or instead, we can listen  to it; perhaps there’s more  it can say. The research that I undertake does not grow  out of an intuition about  the answer, but from  an  intuition  that   I  can  undertake  activities in  such  a  way   as  to  raise questions. Perhaps this  is what  links  it to design thinking. Design  is more  often involved in  question than  answer finding;  perhaps for  some,  more  concerned with  listening than  speaking.
