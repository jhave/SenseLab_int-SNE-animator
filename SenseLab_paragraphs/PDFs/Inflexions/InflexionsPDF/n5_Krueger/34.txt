In A Progress Note on Research into a Cybernetic Analogue of Fabric, Stafford  Beer, a cybernetician of management, reviewed an  astonishing series  of investigations into control  mechanisms for highly  dimensional complex systems (Beer 1994). He was doubtful that  computational techniques could  be crafted that  would contain the  requisite variety (Ashby  1958), so rather than  designing a control  system he attempted to take an existing  self-organized system of high  variety and  constrain it.  He  worked on  what   he  called  “fungoid” or  chemical   systems inspired  by Paskian colloidal cells (Pask  1961).  He devised a game  to be played by children to  solve  simultaneous linear   equations as  well  as  a  physical network  to  be occupied by pigeons or rats,  and  he considered the  activity  of social  insects.  He experimented  with   fresh-water  crustaceans  by  inducing  them   to  ingest   iron filings  and  then  subjected them  to environmental variables transduced into electromagnetic fields.  He worked with  populations of protozoa and  eventually the ecology  of a pond.
