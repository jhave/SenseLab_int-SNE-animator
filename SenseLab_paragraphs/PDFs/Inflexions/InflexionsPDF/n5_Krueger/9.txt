All of my efforts to build  a monster subwoofer were failures, although the modes of failure  varied.  Hot-rolled mill-finished steel  plate  suspended in a testing rig produced a wide  range  of frequencies, many  of which  were in the audible range, complicating and  obscuring those  that were  not.   The steel was a completely inappropriate   substrate   for   producing   infrasound,   but    it   sure    sounded interesting.
