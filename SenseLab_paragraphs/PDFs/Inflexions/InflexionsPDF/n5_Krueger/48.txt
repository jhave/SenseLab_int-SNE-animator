structure,   but   also   thereby  to   share    similar    problems  when   matters  of explanation confront them.  Oyama is able to show  that approaches that make  use of this  oppositional structure encounter similar  impasses in accounting for  the developmental sequence of organisms. In this case, a common shape or structure of the framework, rather than  its explicit details, circumscribes its utility.  Having understood this,  it is possible to examine similar  structures in other  domains in this light and  perhaps to find equivalent opportunities for a new understanding.
