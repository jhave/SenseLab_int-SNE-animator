In this paper I recount a series  of experiences with  the anomalous behavior of a vibrating steel  plate  and  reflect  upon what  it suggests about  my  understanding of materials. I hesitate to call these  experiences “experiments” as they  aspire  to and  achieve  little of the control  that  scientific  experiments require. In addition,  I do not begin  with  a hypothesis and  collect evidence. I do not intend to add  to a collective  body  of knowledge, but  rather, to  wear  away  at  what  I “know” in order to become  more  open  to potential and  possibility. So, I do  not  approach this activity  as either  a scientist  seeking to uncover the nature of things or as an artist  seeking to produce or express anything of significance to the culture, but as a designer whose  interest is less in achieving the pragmatic or instrumental than finding the epistemic implications of the work.
