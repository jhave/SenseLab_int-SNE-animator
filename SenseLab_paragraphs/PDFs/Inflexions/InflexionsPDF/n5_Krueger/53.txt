[3] Ernst Chladni was an 18th century physicist, musician and  musical instrument inventor who  demonstrated the  vibrational modes of horizontal plates.  Sand  on the  surface   of  the  plate   collects   in  nodes  as  the  plate   reaches   its  resonant frequencies and the resulting patterns can be seen.
