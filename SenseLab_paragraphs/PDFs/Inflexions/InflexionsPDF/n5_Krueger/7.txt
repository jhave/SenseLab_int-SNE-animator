In order to explore  the  subaural phenomenon of infrasound, I began  to build  a very  large-scale subwoofer by attaching a voice  coil-type tactile  transducer to a variety of materials in a range  of sizes and  geometries and  driving them  through a distribution of frequencies. This  ‘build  and  test’  approach was  used  because there  is very  little  information available about  building speakers that  cannot be heard. The  range  of human hearing is typically considered to  be  20 to  20,000 cycles  per  second;  why  would you  build   an  inaudible speaker? There  would seem to be limited commercial value.
