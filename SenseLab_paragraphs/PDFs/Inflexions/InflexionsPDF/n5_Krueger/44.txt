But the repeated unexpectedness of the behavior of the plate  suggests that  there is something more  fundamental at stake  here.  Much  progress has been  made  on the  task  of reproducing sound accurately and  many  audio speakers work  very well.  Contemporary loudspeakers satisfy  all but  the  most  discerning. However, one has only to listen to an early recording played back on its original equipment to truly  appreciate its original state  of development. It is easy  to forget  that  the quest  for  a faithful audio reproduction has  been  major  challenge over  the  last century.  Hence   we  mistakenly  assume  that   the  material  is  merely  a  docile reproducer of an audio signal.
