ML:  I think that the financial crisis brings to the fore the governmental technique which is debt. I think that debt, therefore credit, is a governmental technique that is more widespread in the US than it is here in France. It is at once an economic technique and a technique for the production or the control of subjectivity. These things go together. Itâ€™s interesting to see how governmentality produces itself at the crossing of different assemblages: the production of subjectivity and the economy.
