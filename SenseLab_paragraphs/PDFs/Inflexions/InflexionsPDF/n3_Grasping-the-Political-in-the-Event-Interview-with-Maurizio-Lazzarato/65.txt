EM: I’d like to push this a bit further with one last question. I don’t have the impression that in the North American milieu there is this problem with the concept of micropolitics (if there is any thought of the micropolitical at all!). You have a sentence here, I will read it to you:  “Micropolitics is far from  being a call to spontaneity, a simple call to movement, a simple affirmation of forms of life (a vitalism as Jacques Rancière or Alain Badiou would say with disdain). Micropolitics requires a very high level of organization, a precise differentiation of the actions and the functions of the political, a multiplicity of initiatives, an intellectual and organizational discipline.” This is a wonderful sentence. I would like you  to say more about this idea that micropolitics may be conceived as a vitalism  or a force of life. Because just today when Brian and I were discussing micropolitics we realized that yes,  it’s certainly a force for life, but not a vitalism. Maybe you could trace the difference?
