How  do you  transform wage-earners into capitalism’s responsibility, how do you  make them molecules of capital? It’s a recuperation of the whole entrepreneurial side given over to the individual. In a certain way, there is a transformation from a passive to an active individual. It is an activation, but within the limits of a capitalist logic. The interest is not pre-constituted, it is constructed. It is constructed through this multiplicity of assemblages. Now  this is really  a micropolitical assemblage. And this is new. We didn’t
understand Deleuze, Guattari and Foucault’s analysis in the 1960s and 70s,
when they spoke of microphysics on the one hand, of power on the other, of micropolitics. This was a real grasping of the new configuration of capital. It was really techniques of power that were changing radically.
