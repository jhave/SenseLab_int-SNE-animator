Everyone focuses attention only on the speculative mechanism, if you like, but this speculative mechanism, I think it’s more useful to link it to reproduction. The enhanced reproduction of this mechanism refers to the enhanced reproduction of government, of its relations of power. And the incapacity of capital to develop this kind of government is what causes the system to go into crisis, I think.  Everyone says that it’s a problem of speculation, so once we regulate, everything will move back into order. I don’t think that is the problem.
