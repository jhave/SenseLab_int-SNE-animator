We blocked salaries and destroyed public services, but we opened credit. Therefore it’s not an individual crisis, it’s a crisis of the political model that put this system in place, I think. As Bush used to say, this is the society of owners, of private property. This idea that everyone has to have individual property reaches a limit because the only way to make it come to fruition is to give access to credit. And then you  have a veritable economic problem. In reality, it can’t work for everyone to become a small property- holder without changing the concept of property – it’s contradictory. So there is no real separation between real economy and financial economy because the real economy is the one that will end up blocking salaries and social services: they go together.
