The only way to accede to our rights  was to organize, to have a social and collective dimension. Now we tell the worker/entrepreneur that this isn’t it, it won’t work; it has to go through an individual relation. We must no longer have confidence in collective action, we must have confidence in the market. This is an important subjective transformation that took a long time to come to fruition. But how do we destroy confidence? By saying: “you must invest! Don’t expect the right to retirement from  your  political and social action in the union – you  can get it from  the market.” This is a very important epochal shift that destroys the belief in collective action.
