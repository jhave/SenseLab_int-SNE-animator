ML: Let’s take a look at what happened historically: there was a large phase of globalization that went from the end of the 19th century and open onto WW1. This is a very important phase of globalization, almost as important as the one that we lived until the 1980s. The level of socialization of the economy was lower than what we had achieved before WW1.
And this led to the catastrophe of WW1, after the civil war in Europe, the
Russian revolution, all this chaos. After there was the crisis of 1929,  the crisis was resolved because elements of socialism were integrated into the politics of the state. At the time, even liberal thinkers were poised for an inevitable crisis and were convinced of the possibility of the success of socialism. And the crisis was resolved through the social debt that
integrated elements of socialism and transformed what was a non-State common into a public State. It’s the integration of the State, in moments of socialization, moments of becoming-common, moments of coordination that were outside the State. All these forms of solidarity, of mutuality that the workers movement had developed, were integrated into the public State. And the great revenge of liberalism was to destroy this same modality of capture of the social and of socialism that Welfare had integrated. So all these politics are politics of destruction of what was achieved in terms of rights:  the rights to social security, the right  to unemployment insurance. And that’s what happened through the basic
transformation of individual property rights:  fundamental transformation of
all into shareholders, fundamental transformation of everyone into small property owners.
