Since Marx, we know that finance is one of capital’s metamorphoses, and the most important one because it’s the most deterritorialized. What is new, I think,  is that in this phase we have generalized access to credit. Human capital, as they say, refers to someone who has access to all the credit: credit for consummation, credit to be able to create oneself. In the US, there is always individual credit. So it’s this system that is in crisis.
