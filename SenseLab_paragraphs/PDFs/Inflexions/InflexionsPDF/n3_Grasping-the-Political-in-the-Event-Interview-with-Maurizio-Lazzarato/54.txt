In order for the world to be plastic at a macropolitical level, there has to be potential for change. In the case of the seasonal workers, change was produced in the contradiction. This opened a space where the micropolitical dimension could express itself. On  the other hand – well, it’s complicated. Because normally you  have the possibility of reacting on the micropolitical terrain, each has the opportunity for recasting the field. Well

relation between conduct and counter-conducts, what Foucault calls molecular counter-conduct, that is to say the relation between the micropolitical and the macropolitical.
