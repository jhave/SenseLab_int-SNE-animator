This transformation of rights into debt or credit is absolutely contradictory because on the one hand neo-capitalism impoverishes people – it blocks salaries for years and reduces social services – and at the same time, it produces the illusion of enriching them through credit. It’s completely crazy. It’s a way of pretending to enrich people without changing the relation to property. This is somewhat the gist of the problem, I think.  The political domain has effectively become a question of how to enrich people through access to credit. And so, the inflation that was previously tied to consumer goods has been transformed into finance itself.
