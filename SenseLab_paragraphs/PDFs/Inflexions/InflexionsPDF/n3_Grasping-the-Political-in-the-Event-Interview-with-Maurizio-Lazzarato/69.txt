BM: One last question that returns to your answer where you speak of grasping the aleatory through very precise and constructivist techniques to create the emergence of something at this interface where the macro and the micro meet and exchange some of their  process. This activity of grasping the aleatory technically resembles an artistic or aesthetic activity. I know you  move toward the thought of an aesthetic paradigm,
but there are thinkers who completely refuse this path, Zizek, who says that capitalism that feeds on this creative dynamism itself becomes artistic to a certain extent. How  would you  respond to this way of thinking?
