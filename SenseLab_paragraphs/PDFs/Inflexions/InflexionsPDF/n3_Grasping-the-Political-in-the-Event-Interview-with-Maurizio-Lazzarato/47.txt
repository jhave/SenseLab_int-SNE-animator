that the rules of the process are immanent rules generated by the process itself â€“ you  have to pay them special attention. I am fully convinced that the production of subjectivity is a very important aspect of politics. Afterwards there are other techniques that are macropolitical. On  the terrain of macropolitics, there are things that are still valid that come to us from what we have learned this last century. On  the other hand we do
not really  know, we still have not really  problematized, the micropolitical
level, I think.
