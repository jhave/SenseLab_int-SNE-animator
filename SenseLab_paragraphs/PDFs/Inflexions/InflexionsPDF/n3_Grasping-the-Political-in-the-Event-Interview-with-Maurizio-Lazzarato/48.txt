EM: You speak in much of your writing of forces and of the plasticity of the world. In the 2nd chapter of your  new book (2008),  you  cite Deleuze and Guattari speaking of rigid and supple segmentarities. I cite: “Molecular escapes and movements would be nothing if they did not return to the molar organization to reshuffle their  segments.” A little further on, you continue, “The illusion of synthesis and the reconciliation of these different planes underwrote the death of revolution itself.” I would like to return to these questions with plasticity in mind, or Souriau’s concept of “becoming work” (faire oeuvre). How do you see these concepts with respect to the micropolitical milieu  that preoccupies you  (the seasonal workers, for instance). How do you see these concepts with regard to microrevolution, or the recasting, the creation of the political? Where are we now?
