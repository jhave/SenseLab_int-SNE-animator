Say you take the  union, for example.  When the organizing committee proposed to do an expert report, the union said that this expert report had to be done by independent experts. It’s necessarily for experts to come and to lead the inquest. The others would say: “no, no, the expertise must come from us.” The union felt confident in the scienticity of economists
and sociologists that would come from  an outside point of view that
would be neutral with respect to the forces at play. We can see here small shifts with respect to preconceived divisions: expert/non-expert, scientist/non-scientist, political/ non-political. The idea was to play with the
divisions, to bring them back into question.
