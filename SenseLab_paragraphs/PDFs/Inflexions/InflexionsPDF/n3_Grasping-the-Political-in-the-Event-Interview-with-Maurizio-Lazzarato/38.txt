EM: When we began these interviews, we noticed that the concept of “micropolitics” has become problematic for some. For Isabelle Stengers and Bruno Latour, the micropolitical seems to remain too strongly linked to the macropolitical, instituting a dichotomized relation from  the smaller to the larger. You, on the other hand, continue to mobilize this concept through Foucault’s and Deleuze and Guattari’s thought. You raise the
issue of the micropolitical, for instance, in the 2nd chapter of Le gouvernement des inégalités. You speak of the loss of institutional power in the context of how political parties and unions are no longer capable
of problematizing what is happening to society, to our everyday situations, to our social groups. According to you, they have lost all power of institution and “limit themselves to defending and managing what
already exists, what has always been instituted.” Could you  say more about forms  of resistance at the micropolitical level?
