ML: It’s a question of how you  think the micropolitical – if you  think politics, on the one hand, as more power and all that, or if you  think politics as the capacity to ask new problems by making new subjects and objects emerge for politics. I think that classic political parties don’t have this capacity for problematization, of creating and addressing new problems. We are still very tied to how things were problematized in the 19th century. The left is still tied to that kind of problematization; the problem was effectively the battle of the classes at that time. And afterwards, we lost the capacity for problematization.
