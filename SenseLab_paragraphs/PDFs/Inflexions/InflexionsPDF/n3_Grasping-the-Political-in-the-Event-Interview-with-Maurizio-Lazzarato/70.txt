ML:  I think it’s a terrain of struggle. Like all such terrains, given that it’s a struggle between different positions, it is not predetermined, not resolved. But we must agree on whether it is this particular locus of struggle or if it is another. I think that what you  just described, the terrain of struggle, is this particular one and the stakes are these specific ones. So, we can measure them, we can win, we can lose. Or perhaps the forces at stake will make capital work better than before – this is not impossible. It depends, as it does in all struggles: there are those who win and those who lose. What is important is to define whether the terrain is this one or another. If it’s another, we must act differently, but if it’s this one, we must find techniques. I follow  Guattari’s intuition on the aesthetic paradigm: if the world is to be created, is becoming at the same time as it needs to become, if the world is incomplete and if it calls for subjectivity, we must make a transition from the scientific paradigm – as was the case in Marxism – toward the aesthetic paradigm, aesthetic in the sense of the production of the creation of something. This changes the point of view.
