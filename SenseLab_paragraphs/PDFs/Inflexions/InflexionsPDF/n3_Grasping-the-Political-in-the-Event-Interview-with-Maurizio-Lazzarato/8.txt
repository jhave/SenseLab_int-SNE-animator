Nietzsche underlines that debt and fault, in German, are the same thing: culpability (Schuld). To render the individual blameless with respect to individual debt is to render the individual culpable with respect to collective debt since effectively the people are responsible, as Nietzsche says, of all accumulated debt. We are trapped – as Deleuze and Guattari say in Anti-Oedipus – in an infinite debt: we are never finished with debt in capitalism.
