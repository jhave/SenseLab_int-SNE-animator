But generally “reform” means that the macropolitical is redefined such that it retroacts on the micropolitical level and closes it. This is how the micro and the macropolitical continue to act together. The “reform” closes down creative artistic spaces that had opened up, institutionalizing the management of time.  The big problem, clearly, is the political
struggle with respect to time: the plasticity of the political. We see how this
plasticity that had been created because there were conditions for which the world could be relatively plastic, is now blocked, rigidified once more by macropolitical institutional choices.
