productive time of work, but social time. You indebt yourself today for 30 years, a debt for the house, for the  car, for health insurance, etc. This is a technique that is present all the time that is not intermittent. When you have a debt, you get up every morning, as the American student I cite in
Le gouvernement des inégalités1  says,  “living all the time with the
problem of debt. I have to adapt my life all the time to the fact that I have to reimburse this debt. So I have to count, to see how much I am spending on the bus, how much I am spending for food. I have to calculate.”  So debt is a technique for the control of subjectivity which is very impersonal, that in actuality forces you to a whole other level of control because it’s yourself that you  need to control once you’re in debt, it’s yourself who needs to reorganize your life and all your spending with respect to the debts you have to pay back. These things go together perfectly – control of time, control of subjectivity, a projection into the future that is in a certain sense recuperated or captured by the debt. It’s
a mechanism that does not create what it seeks to create. And therefore it leads to a crisis.  It’s a story of the transformation of rights since, with Welfare, with Roosevelt, rights were distributed. And now, with this attempt to transform rights into credits – I think this is the deep logic of what is happening – we reach a limit.
