Ritual life was extremely intensive when I arrived in 1979.  Day after day the women were doing their  own ceremonies, dancing and painting their  bodies, singing. This was a 16 millimeter camera, which was still mechanical, where you had to rewind it manually every 30 seconds, and no sound, so it was already an experiment in itself. Anyway, I was able to process this film, show it to the women, and they said, as you mentioned, “Why do you make us look as mad, why?” Their dancing – it’s not the only kind of dance – often involves jumping on two feet as if making a track, a parallel track, in the sand. They don’t jump very high, they just jump a little bit so it creates a sort of a curve in the sand and they do it in lines. This creates different designs on the ground which represent in a way the traveling of the ancestors that they embody during their  rituals, and the crossings of the lines, which are left by those different ancestors on the land. With my camera, I was  filming the dancing with small frames that, in translation, made the dancing look like discontinuous, rather than seamless movement. It made it look like the Aboriginal women were in more than one place at once, moving at a very fast speed. Their response to the film made clear that the representation “in time” of their  movement was a key aspect of the content of their  ritual. For them what was important was the real speed of the performance, of the enactment, of the dance because the speed at which you enact the traveling from  one place to another is itself carrying an information.
