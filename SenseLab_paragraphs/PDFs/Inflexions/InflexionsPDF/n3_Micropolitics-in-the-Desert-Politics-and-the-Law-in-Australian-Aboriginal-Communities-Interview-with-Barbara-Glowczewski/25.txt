What is misunderstood here is that everything in the landscape is meaningful. Interpretation is not simply built on what has been actually transmitted. Interpretations change because actual and virtual alliances change. Letâ€™s take an example. In the heart of the Tanami desert there is a place where from the beginning of the colonization there were strong clashes because of the gold rush. Somebody found some gold and immediately lots of white people came and this was a very violent contact for the  Warlpiri people at the turn  of the 19th to 20th century. The, both the gold and the people disappeared. When the Warlpiri got their land back in 1978 immediately big multinationals came, and 12 big  companies signed contracts with the Warlpiri to explore, digging much deeper for gold with new technologies. And in that specific case around the Granites there was gold. Only some Warlpiri groups were initially concerned for this site, but because it was a place of contact where lots of people had contacted them previously, including Europeans when they came for the  first gold rush, and because it was a place where lots of people knew there was permanent water, the place was also, in some sense, a site of multiple crossings and allegiances. Now that there was to be permanent income from mining, almost all the Warlpiri laid claim to the site, which raised many debates and conflicts. In the end many groups got a
share in that place and royalties were balanced between the different
groups.
