EM: And it seems to me, Iâ€™ll let you  tell us the story, but it seems to me what we end up with in 2008,  is a real schism between the pragmatic reality of a collective body that is working through issues collectively, not necessarily straightforwardly, but still collectively on the Aboriginal side, and a western or white system of law  which still wants to give the responsibility to an individual which has a result of a new incarceration of a black man. Maybe you could talk  about that a little bit.
