This links back to the CD-Rom project.  When I was conceiving a way of speaking transversally across cultures, I wanted to find modes of connection which might open up new ways of seeing and thinking. I wanted to bring forth a whole cosmology, a mapping of the knowledge of place as connected by stories. I wanted to find a mode for making apparent the way the Dreaming works as both a site and a mode of recombination. This is why  I
chose multi-media, a way of seeing which in my opinion was very close to the
mode of living of Aboriginal cultures in Australia.
