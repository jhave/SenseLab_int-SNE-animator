that period, promoting of the Aboriginal  paintings through exhibitions and conferences and films and so on but even more so I was concerned with the issue of land and the question of the legitimacy of Aboriginal politics. What struck me was that it was OK to take paintings because they look  beautiful and they make us dream, but not to take with them the message which is that these people are anchored somewhere. The answer was: —well, too bad, they were anchored and now they will have to move because the whole world is moving. After all,  no one can stay in one place and all this discourse of indigeneity is no good if it’s essentialist.
