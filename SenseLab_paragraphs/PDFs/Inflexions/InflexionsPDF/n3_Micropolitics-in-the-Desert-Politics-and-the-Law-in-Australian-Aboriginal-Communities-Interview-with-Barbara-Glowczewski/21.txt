Now  the question was “Well, this is a fixed work. So what sort of restitution is it? Life has been mapped and frozen. How can this be a cartography of the culture and the knowledge of a society which is constantly moving?” I see this as the problem of the archive. All archives are just an instant in time, while what makes a feeling of culture is how it connects to other archives and how you use it in the present. Which is exactly what the Warlpiri people do now when they re-appropriate these kinds of images and produce new usages through them and new discourses, not just in school but in their daily  lives. This, for me, was one way of thinking restitution. The other restitution is for non- Aboriginal people, or Aboriginal people who don’t live in the central desert of Australia. This project provides them with an opening to Aboriginal culture.
The challenge of this multi-media project was to say that if you  go inside the
local knowledge and try to withdraw from  it its mode of thought, you  provide the opportunity for creating new modes of connection rather than imposing some sort of universal model and then trying to fit a local situation within this framework.
