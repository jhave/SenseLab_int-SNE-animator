BG: The film was cut in quick succession and played with superimposition and jumps, foregrounding rhythm. This was before we were accustomed, in popular culture, to quick cutting techniques, superimposed images and rhythmic play. At the time in 1979,  Aboriginal people in central Australia, in
the desert, the Warlpiri people I went to live with,  had never seen images like
that and neither had non-Aboriginal people because it was not developed like it is now. So today if you ask a Warlpiri man or woman, who have seen such images for many years now, if they like to be represented that way they would say immediately that itâ€™s not a problem, in fact they produce themselves on clips in that way. But in those days all the images that they had seen were films like Westerns, maybe Kung-Fu films which were shown by the missionaries in the open-air cinema in the old reserve which they had just started to govern themselves through Aboriginal council.
