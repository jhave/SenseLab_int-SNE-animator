BG: Well, certainly my first meeting and sort of bath inside camp life in Lajamanu changed my life. But at the same time, I remember having the feeling, when I was walking in the desert after a bush fire with the women on a day of big  heat with lots of flies, that I had been in this place before. Now what was that feeling of déjà vu? Well, it was a mental image. It was that image I had had three or four years before, no, I think I was seventeen so it was more than that, six years before, when I was in the south of France in a
specific landscape and I had taken LSD, and under LSD the whole landscape
had transformed and was elastic. This is a very classic vision when you’re under LSD, but everything was connected by lines, colourful lines which were breathing, and every step I took was making the environment breathe and there was a continuity between my body, the land, the sky, and there was also a very strange sound which I recognized later as the flies in the desert, which was what brought back the association with the landscape. And here I was walking in the heat looking at my feet, because it’s the only thing that you can concentrate on when you’re really hot, and there was this beautiful red earth and small, little dots of black, the grass being burned, and already sprouting in some little spots very bright green grass, the new grass coming in, and I was thinking about this elasticity of the landscape, and it’s exactly that feeling that I was also feeling when I was sitting with the women in
ceremonies and all the women would touch each other to paint their  bodies
and I was squeezed between two big breasts with my camera and I was trying to film and everybody was speaking in Warlpiri, and I was trying to understand. Even in the beginning I had the feeling that my body, although it was white and the women were black, was part of a touching, elastic, collective body.
