we can have responsibility for father’s land, but we also have responsibility for our mother’s land and for our spouse’s land.” So the judge would say “Yes,
but you  have to choose: which land do you  claim?” This bring us back to the
mapping of the Dreamings because we can easily understand visually that lands criss-cross – we can question the point, does it belong to line A or line B? Well in some cases it’s A, in some cases it’s B, in some cases, it’s both. Now our Western relation to landownership doesn’t accept this way of thinking. In the West we have a very exclusive way of considering property : it either belongs to A or to B and between A and B there is a boundary. What Aboriginal people say is that ownership depends on the context and it’s negotiable. Again, if we are in a time of easy climate, then everybody’s got their  land
and they have to use the resources of their  land. But when the drought comes, which can happen every year, or when something extraordinary happens, lots of people will have to come to the same water hole and they’ll have to negotiate their rights.  And how do they negotiate them? They will do so through very complex references lived and reenacted through Dreaming rituals which are inherited but can also be re-developed. They can be dreamt through new interpretations and it’s this dynamic side which is very important. So to answer your  question, restitution for me was two things.
