The restitution through the CD-Rom had two objectives. One was to give access to the Warlpiri people what had been collected about them by anthropologists some of the interpretations that I presented through my publications.1 There is, for instance, a section which is called “The Field Notes” where I give my interpretations, excerpts of what I wrote as an anthropologist.
Second, there is a sort of mental infrastructure, which is constructed strictly based on the recordings that I have done of stories, dream stories, songs, and rituals. This has been used in Warlpiri schools since 1998.  The second objective was therefore to create a curriculum to be used at once by children and by those who don’t read and write but were happy to have the CD-Rom as a form  of patrimony.
