I just happened to be in town in Queensland in 2004,  invited by James Cook University and there was a scream on the radio, and I learned through that scream, that some 20 minutes by plane, or two hours by boat from Townsville, on an island called Palm Island, the whole population was in turmoil because, again, there has been a death in custody. One week after the death, the population was told that the man was found with his liver cut in two and with four broken ribs. And apparently there was not going to be any inquest. This was common practice: there had never been any charging of police for all the other deaths in custody. The last statistics, itâ€™s hard to have official statistics in Australia, but the last official statistics were 343 deaths in custody and jail in
15 years, which is a lot. And never a policeman was arrested. These people
who die in custody, Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal, there is more Aboriginal people who die but there is also non-Aboriginal people who die, never has a policemen been charged for any violence. But this time there was an inquest because it was the right time for a wide protest across the country and even overseas. I got involved in that whole issue doing my own research with some families of Palm, analyzing the process of the court evidence and media reports. A policeman was charged but only two years and a half after the campaign. And well, two steps forward one step back, he was acquitted during his trial in June 2007.
