Take, for instance, the rainy season. During the rainy season you can travel very slowly because you  will find water holes in many places, which are full of water because the rain has brought water in places where there are not permanent water holes. Now if it’s the dry season and there’s no water left, for the same distance you  have to travel very fast, otherwise you  will die. This means you have to dance the ritual fast. Dancing is a way of carrying the message of survival to the people who participate in the dance and who watch the dance. All these meanings are inside the performance itself and it’s through rhythm that you can learn these things without it being explicit.
