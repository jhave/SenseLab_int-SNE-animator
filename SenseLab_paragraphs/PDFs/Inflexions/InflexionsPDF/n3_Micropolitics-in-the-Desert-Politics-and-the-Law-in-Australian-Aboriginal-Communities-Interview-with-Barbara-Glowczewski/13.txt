For the interactive CD-ROMS,  I created an interactive map which I called a cognitive map, or a mental map, which would show just a selection of a few Jukurrpa (Dreamings), a few sacred sites for the Warlpiri people (they have hundreds of places which are named, but I only chose a small sample of 70 places). I wanted to show how these places are connected. Many of them are connected through a line, which the Warlpiri call Jukurrpa, but also the different lines are crisscrossed in some places, which are the meeting places of the different heroes who create those lines by leaving different features of their  bodies in the landscape. The main point was to let the user  create his or her  own rhythm by traveling on those lines, changing the voyage and arriving at a specific place, moving to another story, another ritual, another song, another film.
