Of the many trials that took place over the following two years, many were freed of charges. But not Lex Wotton, who ironically was seen by the community as a man who had tried to negotiate with the police, and who was filmed calming the crowd asking them to stop throwing stones on the shelter. Yet, only two weeks ago (October 2008),  he was declared guilty and prosecution demanded twenty years of jail because of the image that he represents. The judge later on gave him 6 years.
