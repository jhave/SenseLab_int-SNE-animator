BG: I used to explain to students that the dreaming is a bit like a science- fiction matrix. So it’s virtual in the sense that everything is already given, in the dreaming, in terms of possible combinations which are not yet imagined but where all the elements are there. It doesn’t mean that it’s a finite world. The elements are there and when you dream, for a Warlpiri person, man or woman, those elements will be connected into new forms. Now, these new forms can resonate with forms which are transmitted through the tradition and repeat a motif  which has already been interpreted many many times, or
they can resonate slightly differently. But no matter what there a this feeling of resonance or recognition as being something that belongs to a story of which you are part. The Dreaming is both about recognition and sharing, and about co-creating. Any new Dream will pick up indexes in relation to your  life as Dreaming spirit (a spirit child you  embody which comes from  a specific place in the land) that will be interpreted collectively it in such a way that other people recognize it too. This is often misunderstood, leading people to
accuse Aborigines of inventing new Dreaming when it suits them, such as by suddenly suggesting that a mining site has always been a sacred site.
