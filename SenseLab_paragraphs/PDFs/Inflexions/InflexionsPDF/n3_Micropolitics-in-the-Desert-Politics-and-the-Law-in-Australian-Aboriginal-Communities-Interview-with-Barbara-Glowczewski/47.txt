EM:  I wanted to finish on a last closing and opening question, which would return us to the question of singularities. I want to propose three different ways to think about the micropolitical in the context of what you’ve told us.  You might want to comment on one or more. One of them it seems to me, is an interesting singularity that has to do with the complexity of the collective body that includes “other bodies,” including your  body. It seems to me that in a politics to come that would radically take seriously the kind of political initiatives brought forward by the Aboriginal people, there would also have to be a taking the temperature of these new singularities (bodies in process) rather than lumping all Aboriginal people in one box. That would be one singularity. The other singularity would be to do with the issue of memory.  It seems to me that the Aboriginal cultures that I have looked into have a very important way of thinking spacetime where memory is not conceived as a simple linear passageway to a discrete past and a proposed future but is thought instead as a complex nonlinear topological field with transversal linkages. And the third singularity you might comment on would be a
gesturing toward the global politics to come through the election of Obama
with respect to the fear that I think a lot of left-leaning political groups have that people might perceive that with Obama’s election the important work has been done: We have now elected a black president. We have done our work. So there isn’t more work to come in any of those registers.
