So this was the 90s, and then in 2000 I found myself in another region of Australia, in Queensland. During the 1990s there was a royal commission on death in custody which was organized with workshops held in many Aboriginal communities and in many cities. I took part in some of these events including the day before my first daughter was born in Derby.
