BG: Yes, it was a challenge when arriving in the field in 1979 in the 1980s to hear Aboriginal people saying: “What are you here for? We constantly have anthropologists who come and ask questions, many books have been written on us, but for our own advancement in relation to justice, to self-government, to recognition to our rights to the land, to recognition for our spirituality, all this work doesn’t seem to be necessary.” Very recently, the Warlpiri have had some happier experiences with anthropology because they won some of
