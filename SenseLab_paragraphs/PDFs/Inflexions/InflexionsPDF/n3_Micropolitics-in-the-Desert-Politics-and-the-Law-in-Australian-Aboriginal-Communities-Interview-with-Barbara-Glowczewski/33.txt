In the 90s I married an Aboriginal filmmaker, composer, singer and musician, who was one of the activists who was at the tent embassy in the 70s as a very young man. We had two children and got very involved in the promotion of a different way of performing culture to make it exist on the global scene as
well as locally in Australia. We worked with lots of festivals where different
language groups met and re-designed ceremonies for the  public. Also here in France and in Europe we organized many events not just art in galleries but also stagings of art  in its relation to political discourse.
