BG: Yeah well, what happened was that the population on Palm Island was very angry when received it received the diagnosis of the autopsy. The population of Palm Island is about three thousand people. After  the results of the autopsy a few hundreds walked toward a police station and there was a violent exchange of words and stones thrown at the building and it ended up being burned after the policemen were asked to leave the place.  Now nobody really  knows who set the fire to this building. There are actually even rumours that maybe there was help to burn this building.  Anyway, it was the first time that Aboriginal people manifested in such an open way without any weapons.  I mean, the media at the time talked about weapons and showed an image of one man called Lex Wotton carrying a shovel.  But are we really to believe that “weapon” signifies “shovel”? This is the kind of rumours that were carried out.
