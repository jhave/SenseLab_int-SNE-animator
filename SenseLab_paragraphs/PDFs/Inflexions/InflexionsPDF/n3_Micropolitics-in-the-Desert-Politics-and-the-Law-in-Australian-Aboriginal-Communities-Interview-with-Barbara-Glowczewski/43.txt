To turn  the case into what it became, it was necessary to depict Lex Wotton as a danger to the state. Here is a man, walking with a shovel, not drunk, not violent. Observed closely, the image that Wotton represents does not correspond to the stereotype that has been built about what an Aboriginal person is supposed to be today. So not being this image that is expected, he becomes a double threat because I donâ€™t think Australian media are prepared for this kind of complexity within Aboriginal culture.
