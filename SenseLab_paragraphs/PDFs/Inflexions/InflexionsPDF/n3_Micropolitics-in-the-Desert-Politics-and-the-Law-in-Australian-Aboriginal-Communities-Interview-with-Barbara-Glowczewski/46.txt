memory? This reminded me of Australian novelist Gail Jones’s book Sorry (2007).   Her main character is a little girl, who, when she’s twelve, starts to stutter and eventually is shamed into complete silence. The whole book unfolds as the story of what made her stop talking.  It turns  out that the memory she has repressed is of killing her father when she catches him raping her  best friend, who is Aboriginal. And when she finally manages to remember
- toward the end of the book, her  Aboriginal friend is in jail and she tells her
“now I remember, why  didn’t you  say?” “Nobody would have believed me” is the Aboriginal girl’s response.  I think this book is a very nice way of trying to say sorry for the amnesia of Australian history and politics, which is a collective one.
