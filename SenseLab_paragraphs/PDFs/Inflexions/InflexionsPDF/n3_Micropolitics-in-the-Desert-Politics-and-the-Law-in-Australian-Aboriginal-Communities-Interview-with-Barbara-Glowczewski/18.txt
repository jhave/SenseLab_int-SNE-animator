Beyond what makes you  recognize this language or that language, or this group or that group, there is a system of connection which I would say is human, but is not given to everybody to use. In the Western world, itâ€™s the same thing. We can connect things, but not all of us do it, or not in all circumstances. Now of course there are some philosophers who prefer that way of doing rather than other ways of doing, so there is a familiarity, a system of recognition of the way it works, a pregiven way of connecting.
