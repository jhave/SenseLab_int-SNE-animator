And then I came back to France, in the early 80s, and there was a big
feminist movement and lots of things going on, with many people questioning what is it to be a woman, trying to define feminine essentialism, and it was a big shock for me. I showed those ceremonies that I had filmed of the women to an audience and the reception from the more essentialist type feminists was to say that they could not recognize themselves in the women with their big  painted breasts dancing and holding big  sticks which look like phalluses; it’s not us. And I was saying well, it was me when I was in the field so am I going native?? No I am not! My activism stems from learning with Warlpiri women, with whom I felt something which I think is very fundamentally human and has to do with the experience of sharing a collective body. This is what Félix Guattari is referring to when he talks about ‘agencement collectif’ and
‘territoire existentiel.” It became a sort of mission, an intellectual mission  for me
to prove that what the Aboriginal people had to say today was very contemporary.
