During the night, seventeen men were arrested very  violently with tasers pointed on them, their families asked to lie down on the ground. The wife of one of the men who was arrested had a premature baby, and many still suffer from  that experience.  These things done illegally in the name of police were told in the aboriginal court case.  But they were not very well presented in the media as a result of which, later, when the policemen were finally on
trial, none of this data was put forward. For instance, the famous video made
in the cell of the prisoner’s death was not used at the trial, was not shown to the jury. The pretext was that you don’t show dead people’s images within Aboriginal culture. But was this just a pretext?  Had the jury seen those images
– which did shock lots of people when they were shown at the inquest in
Townsville two years before – if the jury had seen the images, perhaps the result would have been different.
