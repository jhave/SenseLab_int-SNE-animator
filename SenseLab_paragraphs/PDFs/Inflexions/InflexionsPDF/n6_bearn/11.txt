In an  article  on  Arakawa and  Gins,  from  the  same  period, Lyotard recited  the master argument of The Differend, “you  admit the  necessity of linking,  but  you [also]   grasp  the   contingency  of  the   mode   of  linking.   You  have   access   to blank…Blank  is  what   permits  these   intermittences  of  non-sense  in   which meaning is decided by forgetting non-sense” (Lyotard 1984: 13, my emphases).
