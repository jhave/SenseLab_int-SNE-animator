The  socio-historical matrix  of the  familiar and  the  ubiquitous site are  congruent. Every  person proceeds by  continually turning the unfamiliar  into  the  familiar,  that   is,  by  forever   bringing surroundings  into   a   socio-historical  context   or   matrix    of   the familiar. (Arakawa and Gins 1994: 8)
