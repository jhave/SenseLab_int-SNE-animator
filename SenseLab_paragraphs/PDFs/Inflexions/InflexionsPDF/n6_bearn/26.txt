This  is old  terrain for  our  wanderers. Diagrams have  been  important to  their work  ever since Arakawa found those  old blueprints behind New  York City Hall (Gins  1994: 30). And  there  is an  enormous number of diagrammatic paintings from the mid-60’s, including even a few that diagram rooms  (like Name’s Birthday (a  couple)  from   1967  (Arakawa  1991:  122).  Before   the   flowering  of   their architectural interest, it  might  have  been  unclear what  trajectory these diagrammatic paintings were on, now it is clear.
