This is as far as possible from  the comedy of Mechanism which  confronts us not with  nothingness but  with  exuberance. Wittgenstein thinks that  a philosophical book  could  consist  entirely of jokes, because he thinks jokes mark  the  limits  of language, the autonomy of grammar, the other  side of which  is simply gibberish. The  laughter induced by  the  panels of  mechanism reveal  so  much   more  than nothing: they  reveal  the  energetic life of ubiquitous meaning. For Arakawa and Gins, there  is, we could  say, no gibberish, at all.
