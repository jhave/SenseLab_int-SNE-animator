The next clue, “That  about  which  we must  remain silent,”  was the mystical heart of Wittgenstein’s Tractatus, the condition of meaning, the unutterable ground of making sense.  The  parting shot  of that  book  as  a whole:  “whereof we  cannot speak,   thereof   we  must   be  silent”   (Wittgenstein 1961: 7). To Not  To Die had already cited  the  Tractatus’  pronouncement “the  sense  of  the  world must   lie outside the world.” (Wittgenstein 1921: 6.41 in Arakawa and  Gins 1987: 32) Like blank  it is a condition of meaning anything at all, but it is outside the world and that  sounds more  like the  traditional mode  of escaping from  death by escaping from  life. But  does  the  thought of escaping from  life have  even  the  aroma of attraction. Gins  and  Arakawa have  always drawn us  the  other  way,  not  away from life but plunging into life.
