Habituated to  the  ordinary room,  familiarized, we  donâ€™t  notice  the  ubiquitous petites landing sites, we notice  only  a few clumsy landing sites, a couch  here,  a table there,  landing sites which,  in the first instance, guide our  movements. And since  they  guide our  movements, we  are  told  to  think  of the  landing sites  as guiding or engaging bars  (Arakawa and  Gins 1994: 34). In the background, even in the Heideggerian sense, the plan  of the room  is silently  there,  habitually there, guiding us  through the  landing sites  we  happen to notice.  This  background of possible but non-actual perceptual landing sites is made  of imaging landing sites.
