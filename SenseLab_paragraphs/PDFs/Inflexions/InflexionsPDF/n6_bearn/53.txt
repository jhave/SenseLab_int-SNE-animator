Gins and  Arakawa, on the other  hand, want  us to face the fact that  we can order pizza  without sharing something in common. To face the fact that understanding one  another doesn’t require having something in common. Wittgenstein knows that we can use the word “game” while  there  is nothing in common to all games, but  doesn’t  realize  that  two  people can  communicate more  or less successfully without there  being  something – psychological or  platonical or  grammatical – that  they  both  possess. Giving  up the last vestige  of common content is the royal road  back from anti-psychologism to sensual semantics.
