Wherever a guiding or engaging bar has been  placed, a perceptual landing site  may  occur.  To  effect  an  increase   in  the  number of possible perceptual landing sites, labyrinth layers  made  of guiding or engaging bars will be mounted one above  another at intervals of one  footâ€¦.Here then  are the  beginnings of a tentative constructed plan for a site of reversible destiny. (Arakawa and Gins 1994: 35)
