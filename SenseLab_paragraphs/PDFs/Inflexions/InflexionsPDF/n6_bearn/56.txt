The   difference  between  Arakawa  and   Gins   and   Wittgenstein  is  this.   For Wittgenstein there  is nothing holding up the grammar of language and  we must be  educated to  accept  the  grammar just  as  it  is.  For  Arakawa and  Gins  the grammar of language is a cutting from a sensual ubiquitous site, where the word sensual breaths in  the  fresh  sensual power of  words, no  less  than  the  erotic sensual power of skin.
