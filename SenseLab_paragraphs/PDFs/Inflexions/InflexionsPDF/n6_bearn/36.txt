Two  methods of subverting this  habitual and  deadening process are: [first]  to cause  an  overload of the  familiar by putting surroundings forward in a manner so concentrated  that  they  wax unfamiliar;  and   [second]   to  have   the   body   be  so  greatly and persistently thrown off balance  that  the majority of its efforts  have to go entirely towards the  righting of itself, leaving no energy for routine assembling of the socio-historical matrix  of the familiar or, for  that  matter, for  “the  being  of  a  person” (Arakawa and  Gins
1994: 8, my emphases).
