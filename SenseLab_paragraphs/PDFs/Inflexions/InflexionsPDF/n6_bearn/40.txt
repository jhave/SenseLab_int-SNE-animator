Man  feels the urge  to run  up  against the limits  of language. Think for example of the astonishment that  anything at all exists. This astonishment cannot  be expressed in  the  form  of a question, and there  is no answer whatsoever. Anything we might  say is bound to be nonsense [Unsinn]. Nevertheless we run  up against the limits  of language (Wittgenstein 1929-31: 68).
