division between the  contingent and  the  necessary, is neither simply necessary nor  contingent but  rather our  fate, our irreversible  destiny. This  comes  out  in such  a remark as: “If someone says  ‘If our  language had  not  this  grammar, it could  not express these facts,’ it should be asked  what  ‘could’ means  here” (Wittgenstein 1976: 497). And  we are meant to feel that  where “could” takes  its force from  grammar, it is nonsense to think  of the there  being  possibilities from which  this  grammar excludes us.  “We  cannot  think  what  we  cannot  think;  so what  we cannot  think  we cannot  say either” (Wittgenstein 1961: 5.61).
