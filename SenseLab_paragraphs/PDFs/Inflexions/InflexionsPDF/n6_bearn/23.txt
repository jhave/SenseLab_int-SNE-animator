Sometimes Gins  and  Arakawa build  their  notion of a landing site,  from  what they call an “ordinary room” (Arakawa and  Gins 1994: 32, emphasis in original). But be careful  with  that  ordinary, don’t  think  about  Wittgenstein and  long  for return to  the  ordinary,  accepting fate.  Don’t.  It  is  not  about   accepting  fate, destiny is  reversed the  other   way  ‘round,  away   from  the  ordinary into  the roaring sea.
