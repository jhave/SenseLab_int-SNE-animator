[The Differend] tries  to give  an ontological and  linguistic (or, better yet, “sentential,” “phrastic”) status to what  ARAKAWA  [and Madeline Gins]  call  “the  blank”…. It’s the  emptiness, the nothingness  in   which   the   universe  presented  by   a  phrase  is exposed and  which  explodes at the moment the phrase occurs  and then disappears with it. (Lyotard 1988: 31-32)
