For the  whole  picture, to delineate the  critical  circumstances once and  for all, the non-differentiated, unselected accompaniment must be left unmarked, not  distorted into  anything other  than  it is, left blank,  that  is. â€¦ Part  of all doing  is blank,  and  so too all using,  No meaning without blank.  (Arakawa and Gins 1988: 102-3)
