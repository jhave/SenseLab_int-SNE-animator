And   sure  enough, five  years   later,  in  Architectural  Body  this  Wittgensteinian phrase about  the sense  of the world lying  outside the world, is corrected. There, under  the  heading  of  “we   know   not   what   upon  which   the  lived-world  is contingent” (Gins and  Arakawa 2002: xii-xiii), blank  is said to lie not “beyond or beneath the world” but to be a “complexity of within”, a complexity of the contingent (Gins and  Arakawa 2002: xiii). The contingent was  never  enough for lovers  of necessity like the author of the Tractatus, but for Arakawa and  Gins, it is a gift. The contingent is a gift twice over, first because it comes  on its own,  it is a gift, and  second it can be “handled, and  reconsidered, and  reworked,” which  is the gift of hope  (Gins and  Arakawa 2002: xiii). This turn  to the contingent, away from  the  mystical necessity of  the  Tractatus,  will  tempt some  to  describe the prize,    reversing   destiny,   in    terms    derived   from    Wittgenstein’s    mature masterpiece, the Philosophical Investigations, but that would be a dreadful mistake, and  showing why  we  should refuse  that  temptation is half  of the  point  of my remarks today.
