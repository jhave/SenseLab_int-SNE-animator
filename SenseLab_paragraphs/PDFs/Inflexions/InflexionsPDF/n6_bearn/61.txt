Wittgenstein’s grammar leaves  out  so much.  A line  is just  a line,  so you  think. But  Gins  and  Arakawa laugh in  exuberance, from  above,  when they  draw up plans  for a panel  about  6 feet wide  and  10 feet tall. There  seem  to be 9 lines  on the  canvas,  but  the  lines,  though all lines  of the  same  length  and  width are  not the same: one is a pencil  line, the next is a plant  line made  by a slit in the canvas behind which  are plants, the third is a body  line, behind a slit there  is a nude, the fourth is a mouse or ant line, perhaps a plank with  a series  of mice or a series  of ants  walking along  it, and  there  is a water line,  and  an  oil line,  and  a line  of various intensities. In the  face of such  exuberance, we  come  to realize  that  you may call them  all lines, and  it may be good  for some  purposes to do so, but they are all different, singular, unique. At another place  we come  across  a single  dot and  underneath they  mark  the  words: “these  are two  or more  dots  which  were unable to be separated” (Arakawa and  Gins 1988: 17). Amusing demonstrations that   the  semantic  landing  sites  of  Wittgenstein’s  everyday  language (Wittgenstein 1976: §116) are  simply habitual hidings of  a  ubiquitous site  of sensual excitement.
