One of the reasons the concept  of a landing site is so powerful is that  it is tactile. When you take the rattling chestnut out of the little box [masu],  your  fingers  land on the  chestnut, your  fingers  awake to the  smooth brown of its sliding surface, and  landing on  the  chestnut, your  fingers,  too,  awake. Serres  would say  that  a mobile  cogito had  taken  up residence in my fingers,  but cogito or not, my fingers awaken (Serres 2008: 56). And  its not just tactility,  the rattling wooden sound of the chestnut draws my hearing into the box, waking there,  together. If the sound were  louder, the sounding chestnut and  my hearing would wake  up  nearer my ear, on the side of my face. Up close, the darkening discolouring chestnut draws me in.
