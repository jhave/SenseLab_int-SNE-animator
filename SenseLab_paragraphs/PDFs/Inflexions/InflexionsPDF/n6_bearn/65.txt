The  drama comes  from  the  three  quarters of  the canvas  which  is empty, occupied only  by arrows pointing off to the  right,  and two  stray  curves.  When  thinking of Klee these  arrows point  towards life, away from  the  dead rectilinear center.  And  at  the  bottom of the  original panel  you would have  read  the  words, stencilled in  capital  letters:  THE  ENTIRE  BODY WAS PERCEPTION. That is the way to enjoy a ubiquitous site of sensuality.
