This is possible for Wittgenstein, even  though ostensive definitions can be misinterpreted in  every  case,  because sometimes they  are  not.  And  it  is such general facts of nature that scaffold  our language. Again: You can direct  someone to  the   store   with   an   arrow,  even   though,  as  Wittgenstein  puts   it,  “every explanation of  how  he  should follow  the  arrow is  in  the  position of  another arrow” (Wittgenstein 1958: 97). [4] This is what  the education of grownups is to get us to accept:  our life with  language. And  this is precisely what  the mechanism of meaning tries to open  up, to break  through.
