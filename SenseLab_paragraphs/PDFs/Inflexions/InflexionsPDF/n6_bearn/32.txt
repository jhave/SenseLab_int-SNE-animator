Having  the   site  of  a  person  be  inclusive  not   only   of  all  that constitutes the locating  and  the articulating of a person at rest or on the   move,   but   also   the   entire   shift   and   drift   of  surrounding phenomena, makes  of it a ubiquitous site (within a locally circumscribed area).
