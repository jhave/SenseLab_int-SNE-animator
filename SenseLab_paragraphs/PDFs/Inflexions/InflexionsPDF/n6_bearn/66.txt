And  Klee insinuates that spiralling out is the way to escape  tragedy. Tragedy, for Klee,  is  the  contrast  between  man’s  physical  limitations  and   his  ideological capacity to move  through space.  This  is man’s  tragic  limitation, a limitation to the ordinary room,  to the language of everyday life, habitual practical life. Klee finds  the  solution to kinetic  infinity  in cosmic  curves,  freeing  themselves more and  more  from the earth,  until  finally  becoming colour,  the spectral colour  wheel where  all  arrows  are   superfluous  (Klee  1968:  59,  61).  Klee  concludes  “the question is no  longer  ‘to  move  there’  but  to be ‘everywhere’  and  consequently also ‘there’ (Klee 1968: 61). The ubiquitous site of kinetic infinity.
