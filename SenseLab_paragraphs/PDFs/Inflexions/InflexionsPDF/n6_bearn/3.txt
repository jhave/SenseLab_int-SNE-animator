Improbably  enough,   the   The   Mechanism   of  Meaning   was    first   published unfinished, and in German. Mechanismus der Bedeutung appeared in 1971 with  the parenthetical warning “(work in progress: 1963-1971)”. When  it was published in a second edition, in 1979, it was  still  a work  in progress, but  in 1988, when it landed between the  hard covers  of its  pinker third incarnation, it had  lost  its parenthetical warning. What’s going  on? Have  these  two, who  have  decided not to die, permitted their work  in progress to die? It can’t be. The preface  to the 1979 edition had  already announced that “death is old-fashioned,” and  encouraged its readers to construct “other escape-routes” (Arakawa and  Gins 1988: 9). [1] Now looking  back,  it is clear  that  those  other  escape-routes include the  architectural surrounds  diagrammed  and   built   by  Arakawa  and   Gins.   The  Mechanism  of Meaning is no longer  a work  in progress, but not because it has died,  it continues otherwise,  like  everything  else.  Nothing  dies.   Becoming   new   is  continuing otherwise.
