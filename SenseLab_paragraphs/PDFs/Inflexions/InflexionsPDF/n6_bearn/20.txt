That’s more  than  enough. There’s no need  to chafe at the other  clues, difference whether Saussurean or Derridean will not help with  reversing destiny, those  two are  stuck  at the  level  of the  signifier,  they  will  never  “break through to the  we know   not”   (Gins  and   Arakawa 2002:  xii),  nor  will  there   be  any  help   from Heidegger’s or Dreyfus’ or Searle’s background, anchored as that  concept  is in practical activity.  Those little perceptions, experienced unawares, are the answer, there  is no meaning without those ubiquitous tiny perceptions.
