The denial of that  third realm  is what  the mature Wittgenstein and  Arakawa and Gins share,  but it stops  there. What divides Wittgenstein from Gins and Arakawa is  that  Wittgenstein still  thinks that  when we  understand each  other  there  is something common that  we both  share.  It is not psychological experience, nor is it Fregeâ€™s third realm  of Platonic  meanings, but he still refuses  to give up the idea of common content, it is just that what  is common is now the grammar of our life with language.
