To give  a clearer  idea  of these  minute perceptions which  we  are unable to pick out  from  the crowd, I like to use the example of the roaring noise  of the  sea which  impresses itself on us when we are standing on the shore.  To hear the noise as we do, we must  hear the parts  which  make  up  this  whole,  that  is the  noise  of each  wave, although each  of these  little  noises  makes  itself known only  when combined confusedly with  all the others,  and  would not be noticed if the wave  which  made  it were by itself.
