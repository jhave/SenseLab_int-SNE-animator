It is easy  to see why  Wittgenstein’s Investigations was  felt to be a model  for The Mechanism of Meaning. Neither Mechanism nor  Wittgenstein’s book  offer theories of  anything. The  Investigations  gives  commands and  orders. Imagine this.  Do that.  Don’t  think,  look.  He  asks  crazy  questions like  “Can  I say  ‘bububu’  and mean  ‘If it doesn’t rain I shall go out for a walk.”  (Wittgenstein 1976: 18) And  the panels of the  Mechanism  make  the  same  kinds  of demands on  us.  Smell  this. (Arakawa and  Gins  1988: 35) Say one  think  two  (Arakawa and  Gins  1988: 43). Decide  which  three  are extra  (Arakawa and  Gins  1988: 76). Please  think  only  of the dot  not of the x’s (Arakawa and  Gins 1988: 10). It is true  that  there  are many more  funny things, jokes, in Mechanism than  there  are in the Investigations, but  it is  also  true  that,  in  conversation, Wittgenstein told  Norman Malcolm  that  he could  imagine a book  on  philosophy consisting of nothing but  jokes  (Malcolm
1962: 28). And  he tells us that the depth of philosophy is the same as the depth of what  he calls a grammatical joke (Wittgenstein 1976: §111). But there  is a world of difference between the  enjoyments of Mechanism and  the  intense struggles of the Investigations.
