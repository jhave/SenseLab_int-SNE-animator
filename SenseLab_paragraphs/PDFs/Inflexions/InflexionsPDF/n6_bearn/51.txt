This sentence embodies the original sin of analytic philosophy of language: from the  fact that  we  seem  to understand each  other,  it concludes that  there  is some identical content common to you and  to me. Of course  there  is no such  common content in the  psychological world nor  in the  material world, so Frege  turns to metaphysics: inventing a third realm,  a platonic realm  for meanings to inhabit.
