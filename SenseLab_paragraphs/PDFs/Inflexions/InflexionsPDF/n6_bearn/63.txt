And  the connection to Klee is made  by arrows, Klee tells us it is a question of life and  death: “This is the question of life and  death; and  the decision rests with  the small arrow.” (Klee 1925: 53). Imagine a circle, the purest mobile  form, generated by a moving radius. Where  the  radius shrinks, the  arrow pointing inward, the circle  “dies  suddenly in  that  static  centre” (Klee  1968: 53). Where  the  radius grows,  the  arrow pointing outward the  circle becomes  gradually liberated from the centre.  Reversing Destiny.
