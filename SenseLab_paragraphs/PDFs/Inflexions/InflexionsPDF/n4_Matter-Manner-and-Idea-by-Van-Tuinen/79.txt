nature but  should imitate it (imitare) in  its  purposes;  that  is to  say,  he  should imitate the  perfected intentional form  of nature.” As De Tolnay  comments:  “It follows  that the artistic  concetto (the Idea) is the inner  image  that the artist  creates for   himself   of  nature’s  intentions.  The   subjective   intention  of  the   artist   is therefore identified with  the objective  intention of nature.” (Tolnay  1964, 88) No need  to add  that  the identification of subjective with  objective  intentionality is a defining trait of the Leibnizian monad.
