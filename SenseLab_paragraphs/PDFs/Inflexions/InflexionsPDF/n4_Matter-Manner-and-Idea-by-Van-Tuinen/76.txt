25 In a footnote, Deleuze underlines that  “Proust certainly read  Leibniz,  if only in school:  Saint-Loup, in his theory of war  and  strategy, invokes a specific  point  of Leibnizian doctrine (‘You  remember that  book  of philosophy we  were  reading together at Balbec…’, [In Search of Lost Time II –svt]).  More  generally, we  have found that  Proust’s singular essences  were  closer to the Leibnizian monads than to Platonic  essences.” (PS 156n102)
