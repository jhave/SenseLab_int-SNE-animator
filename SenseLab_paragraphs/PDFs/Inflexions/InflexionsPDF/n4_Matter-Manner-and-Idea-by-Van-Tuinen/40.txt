its “essential requisites”: “the omnipresence of the dark  depths which  is opposed to the clarity  of form, and  without which  manners would have  no place to surge forth  from”  (TF 56, 32). The Dionysian fluidity of mannerism consists  of the fact that,   due   to  the  principle of  sufficient reason (Grund),  an  essence   cannot be separated from  its  perspective, constituted by  the  infinity of pre-individual or accidental relations to the existing  world that it integrates according to its individuating habitudines or singularizing ‘mannerisms’.35  As Leibniz  says: “Various things are thought by me (Varia a me cogitantur)”36, each thought or perception being a singular and  pre-individual “modality, or manner of being”37. And  these  manners are  spontaneous in the  sense  that,  through the  diagram of innate ideas,  each constitutes a finality  or intermediary self-inclusion by which  it unilaterally reorganizes or  recombines its part  of the  world. Each  monad thus envelops the same ideal continuum “‘under a certain  potential’” (cit TF 52), but it is  individuated by  the  singular manner in  which   it  gives  expression to  this potential.38
