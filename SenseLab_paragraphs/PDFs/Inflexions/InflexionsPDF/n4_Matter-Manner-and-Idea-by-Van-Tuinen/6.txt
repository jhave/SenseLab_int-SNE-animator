quote   from  Marcel  Proust made   famous by  Gilles  Deleuze, the  idea  is  “real without being actual,  ideal without being abstract” (PS 57, 60)? Michelangelo and the  mannerist aesthetics he  inspired have  indeed found a very  strong echo  in Deleuze’s understanding of art and  of art’s interrelations with  philosophy. Even if Deleuze never  systematically developed a concept of mannerism in the way he did  for expressionism and  the  baroque, his aesthetics is profoundly mannerist.3
Conversely, and  this  will  be the  aim  of this  essay,  a rereading of Michelangelo from  a  deleuzian perspective could   shed  new  light  on  our  understanding of sixteenth  century  art   practices  and   art   theory.  After   a  brief   discussion  of Deleuze’s explicit  references to Michelangelo, this  rereading will be carried out in terms  of three  central  concepts first distinguished as such  by Vincenzo Danti: matter, idea,  and  manner. Each  of these  terms  is developed in discussion with Leibniz,  whom in  his  last  course  at  Vincennes Deleuze repeatedly  aligns  with Michelangelo insofar  as his  “entire philosophy is without doubt mannerist par excellence.” (CGD  07/04/1987) Finally,  we  conclude with  a brief  reflection on how  the  contributions of mannerism to art  and  of Deleuzianism to philosophy can be distinguished.
