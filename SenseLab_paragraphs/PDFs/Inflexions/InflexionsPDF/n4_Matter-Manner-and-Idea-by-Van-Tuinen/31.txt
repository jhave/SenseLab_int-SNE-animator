A key text for answering this question is Proust and Signs (1964/1970), which  also happens to  be  Deleuze’s  first  appropriation of Leibniz.25 Although  it does  not explicitly refer  to it, the  chapter on  “Essences  and  the  Signs  of Art”  (PS 39-50) could  well pass  as a treatise of mannerist art theory. The main  thesis  of the book is the account of Marcel’s apprenticeship in the understanding of the differential nature of signs  as  opposed to  signifiers. Just  as  in  the  sixteenth century there appeared a particular fascination for the “explication” of hermetic problems, Deleuze defines signs, drawing on Plotinus and  Ficino, as diagrammatic “hieroglyphs” which,   like  veins  in  marble, complicate “possible worlds”  and which,   in   the   Neoplatonic  semantic  of  folding  found  in   Proust,  must   be “developed” into “real worlds” according to some “manner” or “style”.26
