Michelangelo’s  works  emerges the  fact  that  he  had  a profound knowledge of anatomy. But  he  was  not  interested in  anatomy as  a  science  per se – as  was Leonardo. Rather   it  was  for  him,  as  was  perspective, an  auxiliary science,  a means  to a fundamental knowledge of the  structure of the  human body,  which the artist  wanted to re-create in his works,  not by copying this or that  model, but by  grasping the  meaning of the  human body  in its original beauty and  in the rhythmic power of its abundant life. … Even Michelangelo’s ‘theoretical’ studies of the human body  are purely plastic.  Obviously he was never  able to regard the skeleton as a system which  could  be detached from  the  whole,  when it was  a question of representing the  living  body.  Only  the  unity  of the  plastic  bodily form existed  for him, a unity  in which  the muscles and  bones merely indicate the inner  powers and  tensions of the substance which  they  shape from  within. They are  not  a hidden structure inside  the  body;  on the  contrary, bones  and  muscles are forces, and  need  the body’s substance in order to manifest themselves. Away from  the complexus of the body  they  have  no life. The blood  stream flows these superhuman forms,  and  Michelangelo seizes its rhythm – a truly  dynamic conception.” (Tolnay  1964, 87)
