Finally, if matter still resembles ‘something else’, it must  be noted that other  than in “the  idealism of transformation”, in which  we  move  from  one  figuration or abstract form to another whilst  merely producing a sensational effect without leaving the same optical  level of sensation, the “realism of deformation” (FB 130), typically through  foreshortening and  allongamento, implies that  the  serpentine figure  folds from one bloc of sensation into another within a single body  without organs:  “it is not movement that explains the levels of sensation, it is the levels of sensation  that   explain  what   remains  of  movement”  (FB  41)  since   “[e]very sensation,  and   every   Figure,   is   already  an   ‘accumulated’   or   ‘coagulated’ sensation,  as  in  a  limestone  figure.”22   (FB  35-6)  If  there   is  still  an  optical resemblance between the contrived postures and  gestures, the functional displacements and  the  scalar  imbalances of Michelangelo’s  figures  on  the  one hand and  ‘natural’ images  on the other,  this is therefore no longer  preformed by an optical  mold,  but  only  the “effect”  of a “variable and  continuous mold”, that is, a manual “modulation” of plastic  material relations. (FB 134-41) For, following Leibniz’s  expressionist account of the correspondence of body  and  soul in terms of resemblance, Deleuze argues that  “[r]esemblance is equated with  what resembles, not  with  what  is resembled” (TF 95). Just as for Plotinus “never did the  eye  see  the  sun  unless  it had  first  become  sunlike”23, it is sensation-matter itself that  becomes  what  it resembles, replacing “the  imitation of a primal model with  a mimesis that  is itself  primary and  without a model.” (ATP 237) Just  as becoming is never  an imitation, resemblance thus  has no exterior reference or essence.  Rather,  it is always “a resemblance produced with  accidental and  non- resembling means” (FB 98, 115, 158), such as “the smile of oil, the gesture of fired clay,  the  thrust of  metal,  the  crouch  of  Romanesque stone,  and  the  ascent  of Gothic stone”  (WP 166, 173).
