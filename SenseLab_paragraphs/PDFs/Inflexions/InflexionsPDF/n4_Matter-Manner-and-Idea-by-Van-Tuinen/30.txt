Again,  we must  be wary  of idealist interpretations. The ‘likeness’ between veins in marble and  ideas  in the  soul  expresses more  than  just  a metaphor. To each little glimmering in the background of the soul  there  ‘corresponds’ some  bodily action,  such that  soul and  body  are only different functions – functions of “form” and  functions of “matter” – immanent to a single  and  same  psychophysical continuum. In itself, this continuum is a strange intermediary zone diversified by ideas  but  purified from  both  the  subjects  that  actualize them  and  the  objects  in which   they   are  realized.  For  Leibniz,   this   zone   of  immanence  is  the  ideal continuum of  the  world in  its  impersonal and  pre-individual state,  a  virtual structure of disharmonious  possibility; Deleuze discovers in it the “diagram” or “abstract machine” that  is the world’s immanent cause.  The question of art, then, is:  how   do   we   go  from   virtual  dispositions,  inclinations  or   tendencies  of unformed matter to their  actualization and  realization in a figure,  from the veins in  marble to  the  shape of  Hercules, without  submitting to  the  transcending illusions of subjectivity and objectivity?
