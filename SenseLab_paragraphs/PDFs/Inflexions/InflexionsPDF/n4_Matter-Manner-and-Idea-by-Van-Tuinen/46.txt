Concluding  we  can  claim  that   for  Michelangelo  as  well  as  for  Leibniz   and Deleuze the  idea  is the  animus of all creativity. It is not  a voluntary force,  but rather something that  is – to speak  with  Artaud – “genitally innate” (DR 148), such that to invent is to find, erfinden, even if perfecting nature means  to find in it what  has  never  been  found.40  The idea  is repeated according to a singularizing manner in a material aggregate such  that  it undergoes a continuous and  infinite variation. As  such  it  is,  to  risk  an  oxymoron, the  ‘content  of  expression’:  a multiplicity of possible worlds, hence  something that  can be developed in many ways,  but  always divided over  two  orders of expression – matter of expression and  manner or form  of expression – each of which  always already presupposing the  other.  A matter of expression is a matter-flow, a constant tendency towards abstraction capable of including various possible worlds within the  world. But the  unity  of a possible world or  point  of view  derives from  the  singularizing manner in which  an  abstract idea  is expressed and  concretized in  matter. The pursuit of  the  idea  is  thus  completely involved in  the  manner in  which  it  is
