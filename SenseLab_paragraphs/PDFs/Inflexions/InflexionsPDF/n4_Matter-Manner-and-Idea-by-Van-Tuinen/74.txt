22 Hence  “the  singular athleticism” of the  serpentine figure:  “What  makes deformation a  destiny is  that  the  body  has  a necessary relationship  with  the material structure:  not  only  does  the  material structure curl  around it, but  the body  must  return to the material structure and  dissipate into it” (FB 18).
