41  “[T]he  subjective  form  is  the  way  by  which  the  datum is  expressed in  the subject,   or   by   which    the   subject   actively    prehends  the   datum  (emotion, evaluation, project,  conscience…). It is the form  in which  the datum is folded in the subject, a ‘feeling’ or manner” (TF 78).
