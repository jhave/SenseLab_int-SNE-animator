Through the  materials they’re  working  with,   artists   bring   together different objects  in order to confer  upon them  a common quality or consistency without ever  confusing these  objects  with  the  quality itself, which  stays  forever indeterminate.32 Art is thus  intrinsically related to an art of combinations, an art of  composition,  which   has   “an   essentially  expressive  universe”  (PS  45)  or “limitless corporeality” become  expressive of an “incorporeal power” (ATP 109). The yellow  in Vermeer’s View of Delft, for example, can be said to be one of these “necessary lenses  of a beautiful style”  (TRM 369) that  determines in their  mutual relations the  objects  by  soaking them  in  a singular point  of  view,  as  if some contrast liquid were   “reinjected  into  the  visual   whole” (FB 138,  PS  46).  Art renders a material “ductile” or “spiritualizes” it by turning it into  a “refracting medium”  in  which   the  idea   can  be  communicated.  (PS  46-8)  Similarly,   the signature of Michelangelo refers  neither to the  objective  material used  nor  to a self-expressing artist-genius, but  to an original quality or viewpoint – a stylistic “effect”  – that  comes  to  life in  the  singularizing modulation of some  material texture – when “[t]he  signature becomes  style” (ATP 317, 329) in the haptic subjectivity  that  belongs  to  the  labor  of  a “hand” (TRM  315).  Whatever  the technical means  involved, some  percepts can  be  constructed only  in  art,  since they  belong  to an inhuman eye that  traverses multiple possible worlds. The consistency of this accidental eye derives entirely from  the manner in which  it is developed, such  that  instead of possessing any  transcending signification, it is only style, “the  formal  structure of the work  of art, insofar  as it does  not refer to anything else, which  can serve  as unity  – afterwards”.33 (PS 149, 99, 101, 116) Or as  Deleuze  confirms, almost   thirty years  after  Proust  and Signs,  it  is  style  or manner as unity  of composition that  raises  “lived  perceptions to the percept and lived affections to the affect.” (WP 170)
