If perception is not subjective, then  neither can it be reduced to an objective  state of affairs.  Sensation refers  only  to the “immense agitation of matter” (FB 137) of which  it is composed and  in which  it is expressed – the unity  of eye and  matter in the becoming of the pictorial fact. The body,  detached from the individual soul and dispersed in flux, becomes  a “zone  of objective indiscernibility or indeterminability” (FB 157), and  with  it  the  well-founded phenomenon gives way  to deformation. Whereas classical  representation “takes  the accident into an optical  organization that  makes  it something well founded (a phenomenon) or a
‘manifestation’  of essence” (FB 126), the  mannered postures of Michelangelo’s deformed bodies  are not fixed  individual forms  of content, but  deform the  very object form  of human perception (object=x)  governing over  sensation, such  that forms   become   “accidental forms”   (TF  137)  or  forms   of  expression  and   thus sources  of   endless  modifications.  This   is  reflected  by   the   expressions  of swooning, drunkenness  and   vertigo  employed  by  Leibniz   to  describe  what occurs   when  secondary and   primary  or  accidental  and   essential  aspects  get confused. It is this objective  indeterminability Deleuze refers to both  with  the Michelangelesque ideal  of the figura serpentinata and  Artaud’s concept of a body without organs – that  is, not  bodies  stripped of organs, but  bodies  upon which organic figures  are  distributed in the  form  of multiplicities.19  (ATP 30) Leibniz says that although nature is not an organism and  hence not everything is organic, organs are  everywhere clothed with  or “folded”20 into  the  texture of secondary matter, such that  “each part  of matter can be thought of as a garden full of plants or as a pond full of fish”21.  It follows  that  each  organ  is only  a fold  away  from infinity, caught up in an abstract flux of entwined bodies,  each of which  already contains the  germ  of  another possible world. Similarly,   the  serpentine figure renders the pictorial fact in such  a way  that  it constantly escapes  from  itself and dissipates  in   multiple   becomings:  “In   the   history  of   art,   it   was   perhaps Michelangelo who  made  us  grasp the  existence  of such  a fact  most  forcefully. What  we  call  ‘fact’ is  first  of  all  the  fact  that  several   forms  may  actually be included in  one  and   the  same   Figure,   indissolubly, caught  up  in  a  kind   of serpentine, like so many  necessary accidents continually mounting on top of one another.” (FB 160)
