38 “I call substance what  is nothing but a modality or manner of being.”  Letter  to Arnauld, March  1687, GP  II 86. And:  “since  the  ultimate reason of  things is unique, and  contains by itself the aggregate of all the requisites of all things, it is evident that  the  requisites of all things are the  same.  So also is their  essence.  … Therefore the  essence  of all things is the  same,  and  things differ  only  modally, just as a town  seen  from  a high  point  differs  from  the  town  seen  from  a plain.” AK VI.iii 573.
