7 Michelangelo held  that  the secret  of beauty lies in the alternation (or inflection) of convex  and  concave  forms,  where the  radius ‘jumps’  from  inside  to outside and  vice versa.  He  therefore encouraged his students to “always make  a figure pyramidal … and  serpentine formed” (Clements, 1961, 175). In Deleuze the serpentine  figure   has   a  complex  genealogy  that   can  be  traced  back  to  the uncoiled serpent of Nietzsche’s  eternal return, but  also  to  Ravaisson, Bergson and  Merleau-Ponty.
