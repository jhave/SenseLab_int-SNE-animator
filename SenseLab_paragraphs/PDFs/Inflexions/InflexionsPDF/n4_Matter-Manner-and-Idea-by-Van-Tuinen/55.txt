3 Though it has gone  almost  unnoticed, mannerism is a recurrent concept in Deleuze’s  work.   In  two  of  his  cooperations with  Félix  Guattari, Kafka and  A Thousand  Plateaus,  there   can   be  discovered  a  mannerist  ethics   in  terms   of rhythmic postures and  manners (ethology); in The Fold, Deleuze develops a mannerist logic of predicates as events;  and  in his writings on painting (Bacon), cinema  (Daney)  and  the history of art (the baroque), he approaches mannerism in discussion with  art criticism.  In my  unpublished PhD  dissertation (2009) I have provided a systematic and  encompassing development of a Deleuzian concept of mannerism.  For  a  differentiation of  this  concept from  the  baroque, see  Van Tuinen 2009.
