In  proposing the  Leibnizian concept  of  mannerism,  Deleuze brings   about   a radical  overhaul of the  Kantian distinction of sensibility and  intelligibility. Art and  philosophy share  a single  and  same  ground teeming with  “vital  ideas” (WP
209)  or  combinatory  schemata  that   allows   for  the   affective   continuity  and transition between percepts and  concepts, “such  that”,  as  Deleuze says  in  The Fold, “we  can no longer  tell where one  ends  and  the  other  begins,  or where the sensible  ends  and  the  intelligible begins.” (TF 119, 66, 97) However, if Deleuze adopts the  Leibnizian account of the  presence of possible worlds in matter, his concept of manner nevertheless diverges from that  of Leibniz  insofar  as the latter is bound to uphold perfectly individuated essences  as distributive unities comprising all  the  possible manners of being  within a single  and  same  actual world. After  all, what  remains of the difference between actualization and realization, between concept and  bloc of sensations, when the concept of manner as ‘form of content’41, as the formal  foundation of a composite substance, is still based  on monadic substance?
