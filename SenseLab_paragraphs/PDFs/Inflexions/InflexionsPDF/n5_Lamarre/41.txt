Consequently, although one  of Simondon’s key  points is that,  under conditions of modernity technical individuals are becoming closer to natural individuations, he does  not  blur  the  ontological distinction between them.  Indeed, Simondon’s comments  on   popular  attitudes  toward  robots   and   automatons,  in   which machines become  so like humans that  they  begin  to replace  them,  are pointedly deflationary (“We would like precisely to show  that  the robot  does  not exist…”,
1989: 10), to the point  where I don’t think  it an exaggeration to say that he sees in the  tendency to  collapse   or  confuse   distinctions between natural  objects  and technical objects,  not  merely a metaphysical error,  but  a form  of moral  panic  as well,  which  ultimately serves  to depoliticize the  technical existence  of humans. Near  the end  of the first part  of Du mode d’existence des objets techniques, he strives to clarify the stakes  historically and  politically: in modern times,  as humans have constructed machines that  can bear  tools which  can replace  them  as technical individuals or  tool  bearers, humans  have  tended  wrongly to  apply ideas   of slavery and  freedom to this new  relation (Simondon 1989: 82). Such a mistake is not purely or simply psychological in origin.  It derives from  actual  conditions in which  humans now  tend  to work  over  or under machines, rather than  alongside them.   Yet,  when humans look  at  their   relationship to  machines in  terms   of slavery and   freedom,  they  merely repeat  these  conditions,  striving  either   to liberate themselves from  machines or to enslave the  machines once  and  for all. Needless to say, the fear of a robot  revolution thus  grows.  Simondon’s comments stress   that   thinking  in  (largely   juridical)  terms   of  human  freedom from,   or mastery over,  machines constitutes a genuine blockage for progressive politics. This is why  he pointedly remarks, “The  robot  does  not  exist”  (Simondon 1989:
10)  This  is  also  why   I  began   by  contesting  the   cyborg   model  in  which   a fascination with  the  blurring of the  distinction between humans and  machines,
