Put   another  way,   this   cyborg   wisdom  entails   a  simplistic hybridity  model: identities  have   ontological priority,  and   the  subsequent  combination of  two identities is experienced as a crisis  of categories. Seen  in this  light,  it becomes clear  that  the  cyborg  model implies a juridical  model of  power in  which  the distinction between humans and  machines is a matter of law, a de jure distinction. This is why  the cyborg  or human-machine hybrid comes  to be seen  as a form  of transgression or subversion. This is also why  the cyborg  model often appears ambivalent about,  or even  indifferent to, the  de facto relations between humans and  machines, that is, the actual  techniques that couple  human and  machine, and the  kinds   of  governance that  simultaneously  emerge to  regulate them.  What counts  in  the   cyborg   model  is  the   blurring  of  the   law,   what   renders  law ambiguous or transgresses it. Because  of this  underlying reliance  on  a juridical conceptualization of power and  thus  on  sovereignty, the  cyborg  model lingers not  only  on  law  and  transgression but  also on  fantasies of disembodiment and intransivity, that  is, on instances of unpredicated or self-predicating subjectivity, which,  in keeping with  the connotations of the prefix  cyber as guidance, steering or navigation, prepare the way for the cybernaut as the new great  helmsman.
