individual, does  not rightly belong  to humans. It is as if they  had  pre-emptively seized   it  from  machines  but  had   forgotten and   come  to  mistake  it  as  their function. In other  words, while  Simondon proposes a break  with  the  industrial factory  system that  effectively  makes  humans into  workers under machines or supervisors over  them:  he is not  interested in a return to a pre-modern guild  or artisan  formation  in  which   the  role  of  humans  was   closer   to  the  technical individual.  In   effect,   he   is  proposing  that   humans  dig   deeper  into   their evolutionary sources to seek  something prior  to the technical being  and  human being that traverses them.
