Third,  there  is form  or structure, that  is, the crystal  or individuated being  itself, which   is  precisely  what   Simondon  aims   to  think   in  depth. As  such,   again following Massumi’s  turn  of phrase, we  can  think  of this  form  or  structure in terms  of “remarkable points.” Needless to say, the term  “remarkable” brings  into play   questions  about   apperception,  perception,  and   comprehension,  which returns us to Simondon’s theory of analogy. Here  too, lest his theory of analogy appear to offer too beautiful a solution, Debaise  reminds us that  we must  think about  this procedure of analogy precisely as a procedure or operation, or to use his  terms,   as  technique or  paradigm (Debaise  2012 in  this  volume). In  other words, to  call  attention to  remarkable points is  not  a  neutral gesture but  an
