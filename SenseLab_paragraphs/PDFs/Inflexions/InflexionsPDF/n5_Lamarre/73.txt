I am entirely in agreement with  Combes on this point,  and  by way of conclusion, would like to open  some  possibilities for extending it to other  kinds  of counter- knowledge/power that  may  effectively  complement that  of factory  workers on machines. But to do  so, I need  to complete this  account of the  four  aspects of individuation in  the  technical individual  by  considering its  neutral point  and absolute origin.   In  effect,  the  neutral point   of  the  technical individual  is  the human, whose  absolute origin  or eventfulness is technicity. Here  we come face to face with  Simondon’s humanism, that  is, to the centrality of the human being  in his  philosophy. Yet, as  implied by  terms  such  as  absolute origin  and  neutral point,  this human being  is not that  of traditional humanism, which  is articulated juridically  in  terms  of  natural rights,   natural sovereignty, or  natural equality. Simondon’s theory of human being hinges  on the eventfulness of technicity.
