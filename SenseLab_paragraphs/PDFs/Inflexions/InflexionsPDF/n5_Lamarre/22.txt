In referring us to metastability and  dephasing instead of positing a form/matter distinction, Simondon moves  beyond a dualist mode,  introducing a series of parameters into  his  account of  a  form,  structure, or  individual. There  are,  in effect, four  parameters: (1) the  seed  or germ  that  sets  off crystallization; (2) the supersaturated  solution before  crystallization;  (3) the  crystal;  and  (4) the  less saturated aqueous solution after  crystallization. Letâ€™s look  more  closely  at these four  parameters in order to clarify  the abstract paradigm that  Simondon extracts from this physical individuation.
