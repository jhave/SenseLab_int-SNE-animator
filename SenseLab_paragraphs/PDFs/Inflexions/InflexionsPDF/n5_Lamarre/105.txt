[8] The  language of “part”  and  “partage” in  Simondon implies of course  both partition or distribution and  sharing. This is also  difficult  to render in English, and  translations of Bataille and  Rancière  tend  to highlight the problem, for la part maudite  becomes   the  “accursed share,” and  le partage du  sensible becomes   the “distribution of the sensible.”
