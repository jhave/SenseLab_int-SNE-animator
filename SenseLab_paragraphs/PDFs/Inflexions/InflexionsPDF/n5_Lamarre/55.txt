Simondon turns next  to  the  external milieu  of  technical individuation.  Recall that,  in the  example of the  crystallization, there  was  a dephasing or an onset  of form   that   simultaneously  produced  a   surrounding  milieu,    which    is   less structured but nonetheless charged with  potential. In the case of the machine, similarly, the phase shift producing it also implies the simultaneous appearance of an  external milieu.  Significantly, the  external milieu  of the  machine, like  its “internal ground,” entails  a “recurrence of causality” (Simondon 1989: 57). Here too, Simondon offers a range  of examples of the reciprocal or recurrent relations of causality that  arise between the technical object and  its external milieu,  but as with  the  crystal,  what  is crucial  is the  associated milieu  that  links  and  grounds the  link  between internal and  external milieus. With  the  machine, its practical operations not  only  tend  to associate it with  a particular environment but  also work  actively  to construct such an environment, as it works  operatively upon the field  of potentiality grounding two  sites  of recurrent causality. In this  way,  the operations of the machine construct a mixed  environment that  is at once geographical and  technical, which  Simondon dubs  a techno-geographical milieu. He also distinguishes this construction of an associated milieu  from  the humanization of nature. In other  words, the new associated milieu  is not an imposition of human will upon the environment but presents an opportunity for working with  or alongside specific machine-environments or even machine ecologies.   Simondon’s  discussion  anticipates  his  account  of  “technical ensembles,” which  entail  specific  assemblages of humans, technical individuals or machines, technical elements, resources and  milieus, to which  I will return.
