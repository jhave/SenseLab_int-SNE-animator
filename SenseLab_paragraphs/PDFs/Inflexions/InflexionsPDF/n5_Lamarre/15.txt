approach  eschews  material  determinism,  looking  to  what   might   be  called “energetic determinations,” or more  precisely, in the language of physics that  he adopts, dephasings or phase shifts. That  Simondon occasionally glosses  dephasing as  “doubling”  (dédoubler) indicates  that   he  is  not  intent on  dispensing  with contrasts or conflicts.  Rather,  it is a matter of not  beginning (and  thus  ending) with  an ontological dualism, with  a scission  between spirit  and  substance (substantialism), between human  and  nature  (dialectics), between human  and machine (cybernetics), or between form and matter (hylemorphism).
