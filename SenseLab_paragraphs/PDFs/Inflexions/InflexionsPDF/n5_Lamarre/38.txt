Simondon replaces the distinction between organism and  mechanism with  a distinction between natural object and  technical object, surely  because the former terms  have  been  inextricably entwined with  dualist thought to the  point  where they  tend  to imply  a substantialist distinction between nature and  artifice, nature and   culture, or  nature and   humans. And   so,  in  styling   both  organisms and mechanisms as “objects,”  he reminds us that  these  beings  or modes of existence are  ontologically different in  degree (analogous), not  ontologically in  kind  or nature (substantially). Still,  to  style  organisms as  “natural objects”  may  strike some  readers as highly  objectifying, in a manner reminiscent of positivism. [12] The term  “object”  for Simondon does  not, however, imply  objectification. In fact, although the  scope  of  this  essay  doesn’t  permit a  full  treatment of  the  issue, suffice it to say, in keeping with  his general refusal  to posit substantialist divides, Simondon sees subject  and  object as flipsides of the  same  coin.  Or rather, since the  coin  metaphor introduces too  much  symmetry into  subject-object relations, we  would do  better  to say  that  subject  and  object  are  different points of view across the same reality,  that is, on the same relation.
