To understand this  genealogical twist  in which  Simondon begins  at once  to dig deeper into  human being  and  technical being,  we  need  to  bear  in  mind that Simondon is working against adaptationism and  its linear  tendencies. Gould provides  a  good   point   of  reference,  for,  in  his  major   work,   Ontogeny   and Phylogeny,  as  he  contests the  emphasis on  external environmental factors  and digs  deeper into  the  organism, his  account arrives at  an  evolutionary theory based    on   heterochrony  and   neoteny  (Gould  1977).   Heterochrony  is   best illustrated  in  Gouldâ€™s  theory  of  punctuated  equilibrium in  which   evolution happens in  bursts followed by  long  period without  transformation. Neoteny refers  to the retention in adults of traits  previously seen only in juveniles, which allows  a species  to undergo transformation from  within, as it were.  Examples of neoteny include the  resemblance of dogs  to  immature wolves,  flightless birds who  resemble the  chicks  of flighted birds,  and  the  large  head  and  sparse body hair  of humans, which  recalls  baby  primates. Neoteny might  be thought of as a special  case of heterochrony in that  forward progress does  not happen in a linear fashion but arises  through a sort of return to the sources of being,  a return to the point  of bifurcation where potential energy is being converted into actual  energy. Indeed, Simondon sees the relation between physical being  and  natural being  in similar  fashion:  the  natural object  does  not  simply advance from  the  physical object, rather the natural object presents a return to the point  where potentiality is  actualized,  extending,  internalizing,  actualizing  that  potentialization. Figuratively speaking, the natural object is on the neotenous threshold of the physical object.
