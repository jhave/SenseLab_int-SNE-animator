Simondon characterizes the  internal milieu  of the  machine in terms  of recurrent causality.  A  host   of  other,   apparently  synonymous  terms   also   peppers  his account, such as circular causality, circularity, recursive causality, reciprocal relations, and  even  feedback loop.  But recurrent causality is by far the  favored expression. But what  does  this  term  mean?  As the  technical individual becomes more  concrete, synthetic, and  practical, its internal ground, the spacing between elements, ceases to be empty space, so to speak.  It ceases to rely on purely logical relations. The inventor begins  to see that  elements can be used  with  more  than one  function, for instance, thus  tightening up  the  relations between elements as well as producing the possibility for internal circularity, feedback, reciprocity, or recurrence, and  thus,  ultimately, for self-regulation. I should add  that,  although I am  presenting this  transformation from  the  point  of view  of the  inventor, it is clear that the invention, on its side, can be said to enable  and  suggest such concretization. It is not  passively altered. The technical individuation  proposes connections and  new relations. Although it is too much  to say that the machine is thinking for itself, it is clear that the inventor and  invention are thinking with  one another, and  this thinking, which,  insofar  as it is a relation, is on both  sides,  and it is entirely real.
