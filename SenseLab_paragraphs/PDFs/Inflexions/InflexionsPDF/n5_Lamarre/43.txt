If Simondon singles  out this wrong thinking about  freedom for attention, it is not because his politics  bears  no relation to democracy or freedom. On the contrary, when he insists  on the ontological equality between humans and  machines, he is positing something analogous to what  Rancière  styles as “aesthetic equality.” For Rancière,  aesthetic equality, as it emerges in modern art and  literature, is not the same  thing  as political  equality, but by emphasizing how  aesthetic equality may ground, condition, and  even spur  democracy, Rancière  definitively shifts the site of the political  away  from an exclusive focus on the rational and  juridical (and  by extension the sovereign State). [14] Aesthetic equality, then,  is a matter of a kind of   equal    participation  in   aesthetic  production,   which    does   not   preclude difference; indeed it assumes it. Similarly,  when Simondon insists  on ontological equality between humans and  machines, he implies a sort of “technical equality,” which  is another way of describing “technicity.” As with  Rancière’s notion of aesthetic equality, technicity implies equal  technical participation even  as it presumes  difference. While   technical  equality,  like  aesthetic  equality,  is  no guarantee  of  political   equality  or  democracy,  political   equality  is  not  really practical or  operative without a relation to  this  technical operativity (which  is also, like aesthetics, a sort  of inoperativity in the  sense  that  it refuses  utilitarian operativity).
