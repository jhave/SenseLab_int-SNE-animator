Yet  Simondon’s  turn   to  energetics  is  not  intended  simply to  dissolve  those entities that appear concrete to us into a play of forces or field of energies. On the contrary, in  attending to  the  underlying  energetics of  concrete entities in  an abstract  fashion,  Simondon  wishes   to  figure   out   what   gives   consistency  to specific  kinds  of  “individuals.” Thus,  when Simondon looks  at  an  individual from  the point  of view  of its individuation, that  is, its dephasing, its underlying energetics, his goal is not to dissolve the concrete individual into  abstract forces or to hold  the individual under erasure. Instead he aims  at a systematic account of  how  an  individual can  enter  into  relations with  other   individuals. In  this respect, as Didier  Debaise  aptly  stresses, Simondon’s focus  on the  individual is calculated  as   a   systematic  intervention   into   modernity,  into   the   modern condition of knowledge in which  the individual has been  given  analytic priority in  nearly  every   discipline,  from  the  natural sciences   to  the  human sciences (Debaise   2012  in  this   volume).  And   it  is  worth  stressing  that   Simondon’s exploration is systematic in that  he sticks to the analytics of individuation across physics, chemistry, biology,  engineering, psychology, sociology and  politics.  In effect,  he  works   through the  knowledge of  the  individual that   is  generated within each of these disciplines to arrive  at a deeper and  more  systematic reading of that  individual by giving  analytic priority to its individuation, that  is, to the process whereby it gains or has gained consistency or concreteness.
