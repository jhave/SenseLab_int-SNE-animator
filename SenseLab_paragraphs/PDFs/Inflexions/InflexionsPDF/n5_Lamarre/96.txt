In other  words, Simondon’s a description verges  on the utopian and  redemptive if it is not qualified in relation to politics,  and if we lose the concern for specificity and   thus   techniques  and   apparatuses.  In  effect,  the   role   of  the   human  in Simondon is reminiscent of what  Foucault called  the  “specific  intellectual” in contrast to  the  universal intellectual (Foucault and  Deleuze 1977). It implies a politics  in which  one’s  technical role  or technical value  is not  beside  the  point, but  the  point   of  departure, that   which   brings   you  to  the  threshold. Unlike Foucault, however, Simondon does  not  contrast the  specific  intellectual to  the universal. This  is because, in Simondon, as human beings  rediscover technical value,  they  also discover technical equality and,  in effect, technical universality. There  are  now,  however, multiple universes, because as Simondon embarks on his inquiry into the technical essence  of the human, he discovers the “place,” that is, the relation of the human in the universe. The essence  of the human lies not in natural  right,   natural  sovereignty  or  even   communicative  reason.  It  lies  in technical equality which  now  can  be glossed as the  relation between efficiency and  finality,  between efficient  causality and  final  causality, which   is  also  the “neutral point” of  the  human where its  technical eventfulness transforms the power to technically affect and  to be technically affected  by universes of value. As  Simondon concludes in  his  essay  on  the  limits  of  human progress:  “The questions of the  limits  of human progress cannot be posed without that  of the limits  of thought, because it is thought that  appears as the  principal depository for evolutionary potential in the human species”  (Simondon 1994: 275).
