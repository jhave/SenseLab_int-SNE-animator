indeterminacy. Where  we might  expect  the perfected machine to be more  closed, Simondon shows  us  that,  in  fact,  the  abstract logical  diagram is more  closed, while  concrescence is a passage toward a more  open  system. We will not see this openness, however, if  we  attend only  to  the  form  and   not  to  its  ground or associated milieu.  The associated milieu  of the  technical individual, like that  of the  physical individual  (crystal)   runs   across  the  external milieu   and  internal milieu,   grounding the  structure of  remarkable points. It  is  both  spacing and contrast,  or  more   precisely, charged  spacing  and   charged  contrast. And   the charge  or  potential effectively  runs  through or  across  inside  and  outside, as  a transductive potential. But letâ€™s turn  first, as Simondon does,  to the internal milieu of the technical individual.
