As a corollary to the relative equality of the technical, Simondon also feels that an understanding of technical individuals based  primarily on industry and manufacturing results in a highly  biased and  overly  narrow understanding. Simondon  thus   encourages  us  also  to  consider  dry   docks,   mines,   oilfields, workshops,  and   laboratories.  And   in  keeping  with   his  strategy  of  analogy, Simondon encourages us  to  think  the  technical individual beyond the  factory, not  merely because it is an error  to remain focused on the  factory,  but  because limiting our scholarly inquiry to an account of the factory  reinforces the dispositifs that have  operatively mistaken the machine for an automation and  extended that operativity into  fields  of rationality and  technical ensembles like  the  assembly line. For Simondon, the modern factory  is a particularly noxious paradigm which he  posits  as  the  prime site  of alienation of the  technicity of the  human being. Needless to say, Combes is persuasive in pointing out  that  workers’ knowledge of machines may  not  be simply alienated but  may  entail  a complex alienation that  includes possibilities for  counter-knowledge and  transformation. And,  to extend her  insight operatively, we  can  also  look  into  Simondon’s  genealogy of the human for other  sites of complex gradations and  counter-knowledge/power.
