Resistance to excessive  rationalization of this specific field of rationality (say, the factory)  would necessarily pass  through such  technical equality. And  Simondon does not hesitate to say that technicity is inherently equalizing, that it makes  for a participating in,  which,   like  Rancière’s  aesthetic equality,  may  not  guarantee political   equality or  democracy  but  surely   conditions it.  It  is  technicity  that makes   technical  individuals   the   most   important  site   for   neutralizing  and countering the  subordination of all fields  of rationality to economic concerns in the modern era.
