analogically constructive cut or an operative fold in reality.  In effect, the ground for  Simondon’s  politics  becomes  clearer  here:  he  refutes the  realism that  takes structure or form  to be reality;  instead he sticks  to the  realism of the  relation in order to show  not only that  the individual is in process but also that  stopping or prolonging that  process brings  into play  a dispositif (to use Foucault’s term),  that is, a set of techniques, an “apparatus” or “paradigm,” around which  procedures of territorialization, discipline, or control  may gather.
