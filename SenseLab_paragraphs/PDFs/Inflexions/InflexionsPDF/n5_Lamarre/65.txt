It is here  that  Simondon’s resistance to automatism is telling.  He is as impatient with  those  who  characterize machines in terms  of automatism as he is with  those who  simply reject  machines. Evidently then,  his  emphasis on  self-regulation is not  an  invitation  for  us  to  stand back  and   let  machines  run   on  their   own, automatically. Rather,  he continually reminds us, we’re already involved in machines. There  is something of the  human in  machines. At  one  level,  this  is obvious, since humans make  machines. But, again  for Simondon, it is not merely a matter of human origins  of machines in the sense  that  humans made  machines and  therefore can choose  to use them  or not to use them,  for posing the question in this way  leads  us back to applying the paradigm of freedom versus slavery to human-machine relations. In other  words, what  is human in machines cannot be seized  consciously or rationally in the sense of pure  reason or cognition. In effect, how  machines are  “used” (or  rather, participated in)  should follow  from  how machines are  invented. As such,  it is precisely because invention proceeds in a hands-on, practical and inventive fashion—as a sort of dialogue between humans and   machines that  engages the  pre-individual  within humans—that humans should not  strive   to  “use”   machines in  a  purely  rational utilitarian fashion. Rather,    the   relation  to   machines  needs    to   sustain  a   practical  inventive engagement with what  is human in machines—in a word, technicity.
