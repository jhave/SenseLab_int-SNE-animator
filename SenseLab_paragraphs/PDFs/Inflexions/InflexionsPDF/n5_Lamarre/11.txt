In Du mode d’existence des objets techniques (On the mode  of existence  of technical objects,  1958), Simondon methodologically situates the  role  or  function of the human between machines, for  instance, “Man  comprehends machines;  he  has  a role to play between machines rather than  over and  above  them,  if there is to be a true  technical ensemble” (Simondon 1989: 138). Already in  this  brief  passage, there  are terms  that merit  attention. What is this “human comprehending” which implies that  humans should situate themselves between machines and  enable true  (véritable) technical ensembles?
