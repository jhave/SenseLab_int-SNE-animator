Simondonâ€™s thinking on humans and  machines proceeds in a totally  different manner. [2] Rather  than  blur  or  collapse  the  distinction between humans and machines,  or  for  that   matter,  organism  and   mechanism,  he  sustains  it  yet stubbornly refuses  to  allow  it to  take  on  substantialist weight. Thus,  for  him, humans and  machines are  different;  they  can  even  be  said  to  be  ontologically different, but  within an ontology that  methodologically avoids dualism and substantialism, which  is indeed more  precisely called ontogenesis. The same holds for  bodies   and   minds:  they  are  different, but  not  substantially,  and  likewise organisms and  machines, as well  as living  beings  and  technical beings:  different but  not in accordance with  dualism or substantialism. In this respect, Simondon also parts  ways  with  Heideggerian ontology as well as its deconstruction, for his ontogenetic perspective  does  not  hinge   on  a  distinction between beings   and Being, or between the  ontic  and  ontological. The Heideggerian lineage  remains content with  an unending (deconstructive) displacement of substantialism rather
