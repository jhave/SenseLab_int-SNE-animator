operations of machines by analogy to the  structures and  functions of organisms (Schmidgen 2004).  Simondon’s  approach thus   resonates with   Canghuilhem’s point  of departure:  “Tools  and  machines are  kinds  of organs, and  organs are kinds  of tools and  machines” (Canguilhem 1992: 55; see also Hacking 1998: 203). Technology is neither in opposition to biology  nor  over  and  above  the  human body,  but  a continuation of it. Nor  is technology situated as lesser  to or below science,  as a mere  application of it, that  is, as a lesser  set of procedures than  the “higher” functions of the human mind. As Henning Schmidgen notes,  “In Canguilhem’s  eyes,  technology was  more  than  a secondary result  of scientific activity.  To him  it testified to some  irreducible, biologically grounded  mode  of activity…” (Schmidgen 2004: 2). As such,  when Simondon writes  that  the role of humans is between machines, his refusal  to introduce a dualist divide between humans and  machines extends to other  registers, such  as the  relation between mind and  body—not only  is there  no  substantialist opposition between mind and  body,  but there  are no hierarchical distinctions between levels of intellectual activity:  technical activity  is on  par  not  only  with  biological function, but  also with  scientific  thinking. Rather  than  fall back  on  dubious hierarchical rankings and  teleological development (to wit, first comes the physical, then  the vital, then the practical, and  then  the intellectual or logical,  which  sequence is construed as moving from the lower  or lesser to the higher and  superior), Simondon generates operative analogies across  these  gradations of complexity, using  parity to get at disparity.
