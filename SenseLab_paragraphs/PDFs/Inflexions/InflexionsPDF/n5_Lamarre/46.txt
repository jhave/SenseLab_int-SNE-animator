To  approach  these   points,  let  me  turn   to  how   Simondon’s  account  of  the ontogenesis of the  technical individual can  be understood by analogy with  the abstract schema outlined  above  in  the  context  of  the  physical individual,  the crystal.  Technical  individuation, like  individuation in  general, can  be  seen  in terms  of the emergence of a specific configuration of remarkable points, that  is, a specific  form  or structure. In the case of technical individuation, Simondon calls attention to  a  passage from  the  abstract to  the  concrete,  which   he  styles  as concrétude, that  is, concrescence or concretization. As we will see, however, such concretization is not a matter of making form or structure (the determinate) more concrete. Rather  it is the  indeterminate that  takes  on concreteness; concrescence lies in the solidarity of openness.
