Now,  my point  is not that Simondon endorses neoteny as such, or that we should endorse neoteny. In fact, the term  neoteny begins  to mislead us if we think  about it in  terms  of a literal  return or  a movement backward in  linear  time.  Rather neoteny  is  one  way  to  grasp  concretely the  role  of  pluripotentiality  or  pre- individual  being   in  the  context   of  evolutionary  development.  As  such,   my evocation of neoteny is intended to shed  light on some  of the alternative ways  of thinking  ontogeny and   phylogeny that  come  to  the  fore  when the  relentless linear   pressure of  adaptationism or  economism  is  not  accepted. Similarly   to Gould, in his alternative non-adaptationist evolutionary theory of the  evolution of humans and  machines, Simondon will discover the  heterochrony of technical evolution, which  goes  hand in hand with  a mode  of human being  in relation to machines that is akin to neoteny. Looking  at these aspects of Simondon’s account will bring  us to a better  understanding of what  it means  for him to situate human being  as  the  neutral point   of  the  technical individual,  with  technicity as  the absolute origin  or eventfulness of technicity. Let’s turn  first to the  heterochrony of technical phylogenesis.
