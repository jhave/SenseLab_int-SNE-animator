Here,   however,  we  have   to  consider  Simondon’s  distinction  between  three degrees of technical being: technical elements, technical individuals and technical ensembles.  The   technical  ensemble  might   be   considered  as   analogous  to Foucault’s notion of a power/knowledge formation entailing a field of rationalization articulated upon a dispositif, a  paradigm or  apparatus. In  such terms,  the  problem of modernity for  Simondon is that  the  technical individual has been treated as the paradigm for a field of rationality, for the production of a specific  kind  of technical ensemble. Which  is to say, the  machine has  been  both practically seized  and  operatively rationalized into an automaton, which  has generated  technical ensembles (fields  of  rationality  or  power/knowledge)  in which  humans cannot work  with  technical individuals  but  only  over  them  or below  them  (exemplified by but  not limited to the factory,  especially the Fordist assembly line).
