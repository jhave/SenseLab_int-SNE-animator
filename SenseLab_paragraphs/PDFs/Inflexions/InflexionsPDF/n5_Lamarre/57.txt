gestured in this direction only to retreat into an aestheticized politics,  Simondon possesses greater technical and  scientific  know-how and  proceeds with  greater concern for actual  socio-historical hierarchies of technics,  which  leads  to greater emphasis on actual  human-machine relations and  techno-social formations (that is, technical ensembles). In this  respect, Simondon’s  account of machines bears comparison with  the  “non-human actors”  that  play  a central  role in the  techno- political  theories of both Isabelle Stengers and Bruno Latour.
