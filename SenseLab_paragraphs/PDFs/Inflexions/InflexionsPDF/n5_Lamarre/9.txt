political  implications, albeit  going  in rather different directions. This  essay  has two   goals.   On   the   one   hand,  it  strives   to  tease   out   some   of  the   political implications  of  Simondon.  Here,   as  my  choice  of  terminology  and   contrast already indicate, I tend  to  see  a dialogue between Simondon and  Foucault as both   suitable  and   productive.  But,  in  the   course   of  this   essay,   I  also   put Simondon in  relation to  Rancière  (the  notion of  aesthetic equality) as  well  as Latour and  Stengers (non-human actors  and  cosmopolitics). On the  other  hand, because the  political  implications of Simondon are grounded in his philosophy, this  essay  necessarily reviews or rehearses the  central  points of his  ontogenetic perspective.  Throughout  my   account,  I  am   implicitly  building  on   Muriel Combes’s brilliant introduction to Simondon’s philosophy, but with  a focus primarily the ontological distinction that  he makes  between physical beings, technical  beings   and   human beings,   which   I  strive   to  put   in  relation to  the philosophy of history and  science in the hope  of both providing a complement to Combes’s work  on the politics  of labor and paying a compliment to it.
