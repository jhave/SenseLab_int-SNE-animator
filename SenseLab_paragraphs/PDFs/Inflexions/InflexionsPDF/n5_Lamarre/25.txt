Let  me  force  the  analogy and  say  that  the  absolute origin  is eventful like  the speed of  light  within the  general theory of  relativity. There  is  a  universe of general relativity, but relations are relative to the speed of light  in that  universe. Likewise,  the  event  of crystallization entails  the  activation of an  individuating “world” or “universe” whose  relations are relative to an absolute origin.  While I envision plenty of reasonable objections to my forced  analogy, I like this analogy because it highlights in advance a basic  question that  is often  posed of such  an approach: if events  of individuation set up relativistic worlds, how  do worlds or universes  interact?  In  other   words,  how   will   Simondon  move   beyond  the problem of pre-established harmony that informed Leibniz’s monadology?
