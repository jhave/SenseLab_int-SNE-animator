While the wave  of fascination with  cyborgs,  both  in popular culture and  cultural analysis, seems  to have  peaked and  abated, the  thorny question of the  relation between humans and  machines persists. In  fact,  the  fascination with  cyborgs seemed to reach  an  impasse, blocking rather than  opening further inquiry. Ian Hacking  notes   something  of  the   sort   in   his   essay   “Canguilhem  amid   the Cyborgs” (Hacking 1998), suggesting a certain  proximity between Descartes and Donna Haraway in their  take on the relation between humans and  machines. Hacking  offers  this  passage from  Haraway’s  celebrated “Cyborg Manifesto”: “Late   twentieth  century  machines  have   made    thoroughly  ambiguous  the difference between  natural  and   artificial…   and   many   other   distinctions that apply to organisms and  machines” (Haraway 1991: 152). If such  wisdom about cyborgs   reaches   an  impasse, it  is  because the  emphasis ultimately falls  on  a blurring of distinctions. As such,  it would seem that  there  is in fact an initial  and fundamental distinction to be made  between humans and  machines, or between organisms and  mechanisms, which  subsequently becomes  blurred and  confused upon the  appearance of  the  cyborg.  Also,  because the  status of  this human/machine distinction is not clear (is it a societal  bias, cultural fantasy, false abstraction, or all of these?),  it comes to feel like a substantialist distinction. Even as it proposes to blur distinctions, this sort of cyborg  model unwittingly begins  to take  on  the  weight of  dualism and   substantialism, acting   as  if  humans and machines were  ontologically different, and  mobilizing a range  of dualist oppositions (nature/artifice, mind/body, organic/inorganic) only to posit a subsequent fusing  and blurring of them.
