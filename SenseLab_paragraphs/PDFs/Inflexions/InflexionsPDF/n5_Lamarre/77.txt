In ontogenetic terms,  focusing on internal recurrent causality serves  to highlight how the technical individual comes closer and  closer to the natural object (but, of course,  remains nonetheless distinct ontologically). But there  is more  at stake  in the emphasis on the internal. In genealogical or phylogenetic terms,  Simondon’s insistence on  starting with  what  happens inside  the  machine is consistent with his rejection  of the evolutionary model that  is frequently called  “adaptationism.” Here,  rather than  simply assume that  Simondon is following Bergson’s ideas  of creative evolution (and  the overlap is often  striking), I would like to enlarge the evolutionary  field   and    situate  Simondon’s   theory  of   evolution  alongside biologists and  historians of  science  who  have  also  challenged adaptationism, notably  Stephen  J. Gould and   Richard  Lewontin,  but  also  a  range   of  other scientists and  commentators who  explored the  evidence against adaptationism and  looked for alternative models for evolution. [18]
