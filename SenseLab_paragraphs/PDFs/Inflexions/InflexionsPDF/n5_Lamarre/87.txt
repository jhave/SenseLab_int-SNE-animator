In  modern times,   Simondon  sees  the  emergence  of  technical individuals  or machines  with   the   gradual  “liberation”  of  technical  procedures  that   were formerly “enslaved” or inferiorized, that  is, forcibly  associated with  lesser  social positions and  actively  disavowed, inventors begin  to attend to the  potentiality within the operations of technical objects, resulting in machines. But Simondon is adamant:  such  progress is  not  a  matter of  greater automation but  of  a  great margin of indetermination (due  to recurrent causality) within machines and between machines and  the world. This is technical individuation from  the point of view  of ontogeny, of the  genesis  of an individual machine, so to speak.  But, because machines also exist in series  and  in ensembles, we also need  to look  at their  phylogeny, at  the  relation between reproduction  and  transformation. On the  basis  of  his  running  analogy to  the  natural object,  Simondon  notes   that technical evolution is very  different from  that  of organisms: with  machines, it is as if the  organ  separated from  the  body  and  functioned as a seed  or germ  for a new  individual or a new  line of individuals. Thus  we return to the  point  of the
