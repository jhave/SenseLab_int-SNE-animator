For   Simondon,  the   “organs”  of   the   technical  individual   are   its   technical elements—its springs, blades,  needles, and  pulleys, to give  a few  examples. He refers to such technical elements as highly  concretized forces or capacities, which is different from the concretization of technical individuals. It is as if the technical element had  so thoroughly stabilized and  concretized the  recurrent causality of the machine that  they  approach the limit of realizing their  associated milieu.  The technical elements can  be used  in a variety of milieus and  thus  made  to work together in various kinds  of technical individuals and  technical ensembles. As forces for undergoing capacities or producing capacities, these technical elements might  be said  to be instances of technicity as such.  Indeed, they  bear  a technical value    independent   of   economic   value.    Because    technical   elements   are autonomous,  it  is  they   who   are  transmitted  to  posterity—not  the  technical individual. In addition, because “organs” are that  which  are transmitted, the evolution  of  technical  individuals  implies  “a   line   of  causality  that   is  not rectilinear but like the teeth  of a saw, with  the same reality  existing  in the form of an  element,  and   then   as  a  characteristic  of  the  individual, and   finally   as  a characteristic of the  ensemble” (Simondon 1989: 66). But we  should also  recall that the technical ensemble is like a field of rationality in which  the technical individual is a mediator, a threshold for a paradigm or dispositif.
