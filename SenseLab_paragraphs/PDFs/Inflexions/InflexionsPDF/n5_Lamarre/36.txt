On the other  hand, unlike  Foucault, who,  despite his interest in Thomas Kuhnâ€™s paradigms as  a manner of re-thinking history, shied  away  from  the  so-called normal sciences  (Foucault 1980: 109-110), Simondon turns to  individuation as process in  order to  address what   he  sees  as  another dangerous  tendency of modern knowledge: the isolation of disciplines from  one another on the basis  of their  construction of different individuals (society,  psyche, medium, organism, species,  machine) that  are not allowed to communicate with  one another, whose relationality becomes  unthinkable. And  he  dislikes two  common responses to this  situation:  the  large  metaphysical erasure of difference (every  discipline is really   talking  about   the   same   thing),   and   what   I  have   somewhat  unfairly characterized as  the  cyborg  model, that  is, a remix  or  mash-up of individuals from   different  domains  without  any   concern  for   relationality,  for   actual differences, techniques,  apparatuses,  and   paradigms.  This  is  why   Simondon works  so intently within and  across different domains of knowledge: he aims for a truly  concerned multidisciplinarity. Placing  the  human between machines is one of the major concerns for moving in that  direction. In this respect, if we wish to retain  terms  and  phenomena such  as remix  or cyborg,  for instance, Simondon offers  a  way  to  engage them  at  a  deeper level  than  a  frenetic  yet  indifferent disassembly and reassembly of received, socially sanctified individuals.
