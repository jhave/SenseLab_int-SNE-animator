To summarize the account of technical individuation thus  far, what  distinguishes it  is,  first  of  all,  the  relation  between  form   and   ground.  As  the  individual becomes  concrete, it also differentiates, resulting in a stronger bifurcation of its ground into  internal and  external milieu.  The  ground of the  crystal  bifurcates into a contrast and  spacing, but,  because these  two aspects of the ground do not entail  recurrent causality, they  are not  potentialized to the  same  degree that  the doubling of the ground in technical individuation is. The ground of the technical individual entails  recurrent causality, both  internally and  externally. But  these two  sites  of recurrent causality are  not  symmetrical or  identical. As  such,  the internal ground  and   external ground  have   to  “communicate”  more   actively across their  asymmetry, and  stabilize that communication. The result  is a self- regulating individual, closer  to a natural object than  a physical object. But how are we to relate to this self-regulating individual?
