a  disparity  between  orders  of  magnitude  that   is  deeper  than   or   prior   to potentiality or potential energy itself. The neutral point,  that little germ  of germination, activates a field  of potential energy, which  is what  Simondon calls pre-individual  being.   An  individual  always  implies a  part   or  share   of  pre- individual being,  a field of potentiality. [8] But, if we tried  to trace back from this field to the neutral point,  the neutral point  would always appear to be missing as a given  point.  It is rather like tracing back the movement of galaxies  away  from the Big Bang: while  it seems  that  you might  be able to trace movement back to a point,   you  arrive   at  something where space  and  time  relations cannot be  so nicely sorted out. In this respect, Simondon’s disparition appears close to the Deleuzian notion of the  plane  of immanence or  the  plane  of consistency. The relation between the neutral point  and its “field”  of pre-individual being is rather like the relation between center  and  circumference in medieval definitions of God—“a    circle   whose    center   is   everywhere,  and   whose    circumference  is nowhere,” in  that  the  center  and  circumference present two  sides  of the  same event.  But  then,  Simondon’s  notion of disparition could  not  be  drawn with  a holistic  geometric figure  like a circle. In any  event,  Simondon constantly draws examples from  concrete individuals,  insisting  that  the  abstraction  is  nothing without  such   a   focus   on,   and   concern  for,   concrete  individuation   (or   in Whitehead’s  language, concrescence), and  so his  manner of thinking also  puts disparition  into  practice,  analogically,  expressing  it  operatively  in  divergent series. There is no such thing  as pre-established harmony (geometrical holism).
