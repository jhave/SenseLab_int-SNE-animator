But the fourth parameter in Simondon’s example of crystallization is neither the external milieu  nor  the  internal milieu  but  the  two  of them  taken  together. It is the  relation between external and  internal milieu  that  matters and  Simondon often  refers  to  it  as  an  associated milieu.  The  associated milieu  is  what  runs across the structure’s contrast (external milieu)  and  spacing (internal milieu).  It is thus  the  ground of the  ground, the  true  ground, as it were.  And,  where terms such as contrast and  spacing have largely  spatial and  static connotations, the associated milieu   is  energetic, charged,  potentiality.  If  we  continue with   the example of the crystal,  recall that,  when you remove the crystal  from its aqueous
