As  Combes notes,  such  a view  of human-machine relations is not  compatible with  a notion of technics  as a means  of compensating for or supplementing an originary lack, as Bernard Stiegler would have it. Stiegler seems to adopt a rather Lacanian point  of departure: humans are deficient from  birth;  they  are born  too early,  and,  to meet  their  needs,  must  compensate for their  weakness, which  they accomplish first by making tools  and  then  machines. But such  compensation or supplementation goes far beyond needs,  taking  on a life of its own,  so to speak. Thus  machines swarm over  the  world, as a massive overcompensation for  our weakness. Ultimately, then,  the problem of human-machine relations turns into a psychoanalytic problem:  only  by  recognizing and   coming   to  terms   with   our primordial fragility will  we  be able  to break  our  vicious  cycles of technological overcompensation. Again,  as Combes notes,  such  an understanding of technics, exemplified in Stiegler’s  notion of “originary technicity”, is completely at odds with  Simondon’s understanding of technicity. It is not  that  Simondon does  not countenance the fragility (or, we might  say, precarity) of humans, but it is not for him  an  ontological ground.  Humans  for  him  are  not  originally or  primarily fragility;  they  are also potentiality, capacity, powers in the  world. Our  situation vis-à-vis  technics  today is indeed precarious, but  Simondon does  not  see it as a psychological or existential problem: if the situation is grim,  it is not because we have  ignored that  we  are  ontologically constituted by lack. Rather  he says  that we are practically alienated from  our  potentiality. As such,  modern alienation is not ontologically given  and  thus  predestined (deriving from  lack) as in Stiegler. Rather  modern alienation is ontologically produced and  historically constructed, in inventiveness and inventions.
