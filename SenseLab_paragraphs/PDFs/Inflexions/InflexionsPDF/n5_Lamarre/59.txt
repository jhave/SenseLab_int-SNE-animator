For modern science, the constructivist question is to determine how this practice is able (unlike  most  other  human practices at least)  to produce objects that  have  lives of their  own,  as it were,  so that  they remain ‘answerable’ for their  actions  in the world independently of the    laboratory   conditions   under   which    they    were    initially elucidated.  This   is   what    makes    neutrinos  and   microbes,  for instance, different from codes of justice, or from money, of from ancestral spirits  that may be haunting someone (Shaviro  2005).
