This is why  the politics  of Simondon’s philosophy of individuation shows  more affinity  with  Foucault and  Rancière  despite the  significant differences between their  approaches: Simondon’s approach is concerned with  both the politics  of knowledge  and   the   politics   of  equality.  On   the   one   hand,  like   Foucault, Simondon sees knowledge as operative, as inseparable from  power, and  in this respect his  critique of  substantialism and   hylemorphism,  for  instance, is  not intended as a purely logical intervention and  his insistence on analogy is, in fact, an   attempt  to  provide  a  knowledge  whose   operativity  is  adequate  to  the resistance implicated within the activation of fields around technical individuals.
