exaggerated idea  that  contemporary humans are  at a loss in the  modern world because they  were,  in effect,  evolved, that  is, “hardwired” to deal  with  a very different  environment.  Adaptationism  favors   an  account  of  external  factors affecting   evolutionary  changes,  largely   ignoring  the   internal  factors   (both material limits and  contingent opportunities, not to mention, what  we might  call in a Spinozist way,  the powers of a body),  which  in turn  encourages a very static linear  view  of evolution. When  Simondon refers  to the  emergence of recurrent causality within the machine as “internal adaptation,” what  is at stake  for him is a model of evolutionary transformation that  avoids the pitfalls  of adaptationism (that  is, “external adaptation” or adaptation from without). The focus on internal adaptations allows  Simondon to avoid  the model of a machine statically adapted to  an  environment, which   then  finds  itself  stranded and   at  a  loss  when the environment changes. Instead, like  the  natural object  (organism), the  technical individual  affects  internal  changes and   simultaneously  generates a  recurrent rapport with  its  external milieu,  which  allows  it  to  interact actively  with  the world and  to produce a transformative series.  Again,  this  view  of the  technical individual is reminiscent of the non-human actor  in Latour and  Stengers, but  to put  it in  a  quasi-Spinozist way,  Simondon is interested in  the  details of how specific technical bodies  have the power to affect and  to be affected.
