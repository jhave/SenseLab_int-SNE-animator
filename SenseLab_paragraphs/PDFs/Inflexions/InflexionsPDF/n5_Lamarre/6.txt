than   finding  new   points  of  the   departure.  The   cyborg   model,  as  I  have characterized it, oscillates  between two understandings of technology: on the one hand, a Heideggerian or post-Heideggerian deconstructionist understanding that speaks  of an  “essence of technology” while  ultimately resorting to a linguistic model for techniques, which  tends to bring  everything back  under the  signifier, law  and   Being;  and   on  the  other   hand,  Norbert Wiener’s  cybernetic theory which,   for  all  his  interest in  and   admiration for  it,  Simondon thought  quite dangerous in its tendency to blur  the distinction between animals and  machines, ultimately reducing the human and society to the machine.
