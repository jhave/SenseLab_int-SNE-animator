ultimate redundancy of humans in the  domain of fabrication. Simondon shows that  there  is no evidence that  this is how  things have  proceeded or will proceed. Again,  we  suspect that  if things have  often  turned out  badly,  it is due  to  the imposition of economic concerns upon technical individuation,  which  forces  a rectilinear movement and  a simplistic temporality of progress. In any  event, Simondon’s  attention to the  relation between three  modes of technical being— element, individual,  and   ensemble,  allows   him  to  parse   the  heterochrony  of technical evolution: technical evolution is not from element (organ),  to individual (organism), to ensemble (culture), for technical individuals do not  reproduce as organisms do. Crucial  then  for coming  to terms  with  technical evolution is not to mistake the  function of technical individual. We must  not  assume that  humans should play  that  role,  for  in  effect,  we  then  begin  to  collapse   the  distinction between human and  machine, entering into  a war  over  which  will play  the role of technical individual. The facts of technical evolution suggest to Simondon that, rather than  impose rectilinear progress on  technicity, humans should insert themselves into  the  true  tendency of technical evolution—which is non-linear and   discontinuous—by  situating  themselves  with   technical  individuals  and thereby participating equally in the relation between technical elements and technical  ensembles.  The  result   would  be,  if  we  paint   it  in  utopian  tones, technical ensembles and  fields  of rationality that  assume and  prolong equality- in-difference between humans and  between humans and  machines. This is what machines do with  us.
