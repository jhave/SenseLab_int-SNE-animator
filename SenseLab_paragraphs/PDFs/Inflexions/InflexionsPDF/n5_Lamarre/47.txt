When  he looks at the individuation of machines from  the angle  of the process of invention, Simondon sees a passage from  an  abstract, analytical, logical  system toward  a   concrete,  synthetic,  practical  system.  Inventors   begin   designing machines with  an eye to accomplishing a single  task,  which  they  diagram in an abstract, analytic fashion;  but  as they  actually use  the  machine, the  design itself begins  to demand practical adjustments,  bringing into  play  other  aspects of its basic   elements,  adding  new   elements  and   creating  new   relations  among elements. For instance, you  design a motor  to turn  a wheel  without necessarily thinking about  the  materials, but  when building and  operating it, you  discover that  certain  materials, forged in a such  as way  as to produce specific  qualities, work  better.  In effect, it becomes  self-regulating. Usually it is a matter of a combination or synthesis of different materials, which  is why  Simondon sees  a passage toward a concrete and  synthetic system.
