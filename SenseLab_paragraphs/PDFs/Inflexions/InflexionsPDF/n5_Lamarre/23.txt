First, the seed  or germ  that  makes  the crystalline structure materialize out of the supersaturated  solution is, in a sense,  just  a tiny  little  impurity. But along  the surface  of that  little impurity is a moment or site that  is configured in a manner that  is isomorphic to the  coming  crystal.  For  instance, if you  ever  made  “rock candy” by  crystallizing sugar on  a  string  by  dipping it into  a supersaturated solution, you  know  that  the  string  doesn’t look  at all like the  resultant crystals that  form  on  it. But somewhere along  the  string  is a sort  of isomorphic trigger that starts  the crystallization. This trigger may be so small that we might  never  be
