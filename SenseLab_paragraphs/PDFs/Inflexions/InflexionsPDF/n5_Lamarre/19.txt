Now,  the crystal  is an instance of a form  or structure. Focusing on the process of emergence  of  a  form   or   structure,  Simondon  challenges  received  ways   of thinking about  form.  In particular, he rejects  the  hylemorphic schema in which form  is imposed upon matter, in which  matter figures  as a passive recipient for the active imposition of structure or form, for such a schema implies dualism and substantialism from  the  outset. With  the  example of crystallization, whether of ice from  super-cooled water or of minerals from  a supersaturated solution, Simondon  shows   the  inadequacy  of  the  form/matter  opposition  for understanding actual  processes. He shows  that  we cannot simply begin  with  the form  or  structure  (crystal)   as  a  self-identical, autonomous,  given   individual. Instead he demonstrates that  the individual is always in process. The individual is   individuating,   dephasing,   becoming.  This   does   not   simply  mean    that everything, no  matter how  stable  in  appearance, is  actually in  flux  and  thus ephemeral and  not a cause  for concern. Simondon reminds us that  if something appears stable  to  us,  that  stability is relative to  a frame  of reference, or  more precisely, to a concern. [5] And  that  frame  of reference appears stable  because, as a concern, it is also individuating, that  is, it is operatively producing a connection between different orders of magnitude. I will return to the notion of a concern as well. But let me continue with  the stakes  of individuation for Simondon.
