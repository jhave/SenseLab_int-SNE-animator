but rather of exploring its specific kind  of openness, that  is, the implicit limits  or potential orientations enabling such openness. In other  words, the individual remains open  in that  its relations implicit  an underlying set of potentials, which at  once  grounds  and   exceeds   the  actual   relations  that   it  has  established.  If Simondon’s philosophy is aptly  characterized as a “philosophy of individuation” as well as a “philosophy of relations,” it is because his focus on the individuation of the individuals in different domains necessarily entails  giving  real priority to the relation over  the terms  of the relation. I will below  return to his emphasis on thinking the  relation. But first,  in keeping with  the  concreteness of Simondon’s abstractions,  let   me   look   at   one   of   his   paradigms  for   thinking  physical individuation — the formation of crystals,  such  as ice crystals  from  supercooled water, or mineral crystals  from a supersaturated aqueous solution.
