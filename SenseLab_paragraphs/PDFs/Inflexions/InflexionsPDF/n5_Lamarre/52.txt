his  argument about  what  counts as a technical individual. [16] Some  machines are ruled out (the audiometer), others  are tentatively included but only with qualification. For my purposes here, a very basic example will suffice. When Simondon addresses the cooling  of the automobile engine,  he weighs the merits of  air-cooling and  water-cooling (Simondon 1989: 25). Air-cooled engines are more  concrete, because you donâ€™t have  to add  a sub-system to the engine:  the air element is directly there.  Water-cooling is semi-concrete. If you  could  produce water from  the running of the engine  and  re-direct it for cooling,  or if you could power the  water circulation directly from  the  engine,  the  engine  would become more  concrete. In practice, however, water is circulated via a water pump driven by a separate drive  belt. Nonetheless, Simondon concludes that  water-cooling is more  concrete than  air-cooling if you  look  at  the  engine   in  terms  of  security measures, for water absorbs and  disperses heat more  effectively  than  air. In other words,  insofar    as   introducing  water  allows    for   better    self-regulation,   it encourages concretization, but water is not part  of the immediate operating environment of the engine  as air is.
