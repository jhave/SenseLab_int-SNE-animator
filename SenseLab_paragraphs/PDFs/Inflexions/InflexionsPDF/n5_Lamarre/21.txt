A physical system is said  to be in metastable equilibrium (or false equilibrium) when the least  modification of system parameters (pressure, temperature, etc.) suffices  to break  its equilibrium. Thus, in   super-cooled  water  (that   is,   water  remaining  liquid  at   a temperature below  its  freezing point),   the  least  impurity with  a structure isomorphic to that  of ice plays  the role of a seed  for crystallization and suffices to turn  the water to ice. Before all individuation, being  can be understood as a system containing potential energy. Although it exists  as an action at the  heart  of the system, this energy is called  potential because it requires a transformation of the system in order to be structured, that  is, to be actualized in accordance with  structures. Pre-individual being,  and in a general way,  any  system that  finds  itself in a metastable state, harbors potentials that,  because they belong  to heterogeneous dimensions of being,  are incompatible. This is why  it can only perpetuate itself by dephasing. (Combes 1999: 11).
