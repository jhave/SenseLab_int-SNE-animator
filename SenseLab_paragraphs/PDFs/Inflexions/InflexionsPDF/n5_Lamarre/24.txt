able to identify or isolate  it precisely. It is, then,  in abstract terms,  a point.  And  as Brian  Massumi styles  it, it is a “neutral point.” [6] It is a point,  the point,  that starts   the  event   of  crystallization,  but  it  is  part   of  the  event,   not  outside of happening. It is physically inside  the crystal,  continuous with  its structure, and  at the same time, just as the string  remains distinct from the crystals  that form upon it, this  neutral point  is equally outside the  crystal.  Subsequently, when dealing with  the  history of technology, Simondon introduces the  notion of an “absolute origin,” [7] which  is like a neutral point.  But there  is a slight  distinction. We can think  of the  neutral point  in  relation to  the  physical form  of the  crystal,  as  a given,  while  the absolute origin  refers  to the eventfulness that  is triggered by the neutral point,  the  activation of the  field  of potential energy. The  proximity of neutral point  and  absolute origin  helps  us to understand how  this neutral point functions:  the  relations triggered or activated by  the  neutral point  are  relative, but  the  entire  set  of relations, potential and  actual,  are  relative to an  absolute origin   (an   eventfulness),  which    allows    them    to   be   operative  as   well   as measurable within a frame  of reference, or more  precisely, within a concerned relation.
