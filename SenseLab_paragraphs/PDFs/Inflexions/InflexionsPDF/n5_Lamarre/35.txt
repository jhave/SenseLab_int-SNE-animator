sociology approaches society as an individual; psychology takes up the psyche as its individual; biology  sets  up  life forms,  cells or species,  as individuals; media studies  works   through  the   isolation  of  different  media;   and   so  forth.   For Simondon, the problem of modernity then  is twofold. On the one hand, there  are signs  in Simondon of a Foucauldian concern for how  knowledge constructs its objects,  because the  apparatuses or  paradigms that  discipline, regulate, normativize,  or   control    specific   individuals,  tend    to   generate  knowledge precisely   by   erasing   individuation   (process)  and    treating  the   individual (structure  or  form)   as  given.   Simondonâ€™s  focus  on  individuation  as  process evokes  the absolute origin  of the form/ground relation in order to re-potentialize the  ground of the  (modern) individual, because this  is where resistance (in the electrical  sense)  to non-progressive modes of rationalization is already at work, where  resistance  may   be  brought  into   play,   activated  or   potentialized  in progressive ways.
