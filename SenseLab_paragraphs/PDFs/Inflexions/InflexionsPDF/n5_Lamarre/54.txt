Thus  it  would not  suffice  to  say  that  the  technical object  is  one whose  specific genesis  proceeds from the abstract to the concrete;  it should be made  clear that this genesis  is achieved by essential, discontinuous improvements that  make   for  the  internal  schema being   modified  in  leaps   and   bounds  and   not   according  to  a continuous line. (Simondon 1989: 40)
