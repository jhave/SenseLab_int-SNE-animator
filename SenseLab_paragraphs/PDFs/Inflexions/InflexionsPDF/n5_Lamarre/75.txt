To look  at a mode  of existence  in terms  of its individuation is to look  at it from the  angle   of  the  underlying  and   surrounding  processes that   are  part   of  its genesis,   making it  what  it  is. The  study of individuation recalls  the  study of evolution in  this  respect, for  it is the  study of the  birth  and  transformation of individuals. As such,  the  individual is always in a series,  and  its ontogenesis is equally a phylogenesis, demanding a study of genesis  (that  is, a genealogy) from the  angle   of  the  series.  Any  inquiry into  the  relation between humans  and machines, then,  has to deal with  a genealogy of the human alongside a genealogy of the  technical object.  But  letâ€™s  first  look  at the  contours of genealogy with  a return to the technical object.
