In the  pages  on “minority” and  “majority” in Du mode d’existence des objets techniques, for instance, Simondon presents a kaleidoscopic contrast between something like the  juvenility  or immaturity of human beings  on  the  one  hand, and   their   maturity and   reason  on  the  other.   Here   too,  there   are  risks  of  a normative reading, not  least  because, in delineating juvenility,  Simondon folds peasants and  other  historical instances of inferiorized social  strata  into  the  mix. His aim, of course,  is not to repeat the inferiorization of certain  social groups or to categorize them  as juvenile  or immature. Nor is his goal simply to appropriate or recuperate them,  even  though his sympathies usually seem  to align  with  the minority. Rather,  as with  Deleuze and  Guattari’s notion of the minor,  Simondon strives  to trace out counter-tendencies (and  potentially counter-actualizations) to the  “major” tendency in which  technological evolution has  been  mapped onto human evolution, making linear  progress appear natural, reasonable, and inevitable. In effect, like Deleuze and  Guattari, Simondon’s politics  of technology tends to become  localized around a becoming-minor within the  majority, but  in the specific  instance of modern technical ensembles. Yet, contrary to popular interpretations, such  an  approach does  not  rule  out  minoritarian opposition to the  majority. Rather,  it does  not  reify  opposition by grounding such  opposition in  dualist and   substantialist metaphysics which   tend   to  work   by  identifying minorities and  making them  assume their  oppositional destiny as established by the metaphysician of history in substantialist terms.
