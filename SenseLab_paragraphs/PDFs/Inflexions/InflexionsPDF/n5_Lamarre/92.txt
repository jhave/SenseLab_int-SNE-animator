Now,  as  Combes points out,  that  terms  such  as  “should” and  “true” arise  in Simondon presents a  certain  risk,  as  does  his  use  of  reason, universality and progress:  we  must  be  careful  not  to  read  such  terms  in  an  entirely normative fashion as if Simondon were  saying,  “Because  reality  is this  way,  you  have  to align  yourself with  it.” [20] Simply  put,  if you’re  not  becoming, you’re  wrong. Like Combes, I feel that  such  a normative reading of Simondon ultimately is not justified by his project  as a whole,  but  it is crucial  to signal  such  a risk  because other  commentators have  opted for the normative reading: have-to-become. [21] In any  event,  the  way  in which  humans are  to insert  themselves into  the  non- linear   evolution  of  technical  being   entails   a  movement  that   might   well   be described as neoteny.
