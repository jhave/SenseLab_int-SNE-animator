Fourth, there  is the  aqueous solution around the  crystal,  which  we can initially gloss  as an  external milieu.  Insofar  as the  crystal  is a set of remarkable points, this  external milieu  is the  ground (fonds) against which  the  remarkable points become  precisely remarkable. In other  words, Simondon sees the emergence of a duality with  the  emergence of an individuated being.  This duality is not  that  of dialectical opposition but  what  might  be  called  contrast. The  relation between individual and  external milieu  is like that  between form  and  ground, or figure and  background, if you  will.  But  this  analogy will  remain confined to  an  art historical paradigm unless  we  take  another step  with  Simondon and  consider how  the milieu  is not only external to form  or structure but also internal to it. In the  case of the  crystal,  we  can think  concretely of the  water trapped within the crystalline  lattice   even  after  the  crystal   leaves   its  aqueous  solution. But  the “internal milieu” is not  merely a matter of water left  behind. It is a matter of spacing, and  we  might  here  think  of spacing in a Foucauldian way,  in terms  of power.
