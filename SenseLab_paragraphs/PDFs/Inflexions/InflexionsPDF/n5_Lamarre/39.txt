In the modern tendency toward the construction of technical individuals (machines), Simondon sees  the  emergence of a new  kind  of relation in  which technical objects  become  more  and  more  like natural objects—in  that  they  carry their  associated milieu  with  them,  generating it through their  relations. It is as if the crystal  had  folded its aqueous solution inside  it and  could  continue to grow or   individuate  by   stoking  its   potentiality.  Indeed,  as   Combes  points  out, Simondon does  not see the passage from  one mode  of existence  to another—say, from  physical being  to  natural or  vital  being—in terms   of  a  linear   advance. Rather,  developments that  appear to come  after  or to be added to prior  stages, actually entail  a return to what  is ontologically prior,  through a re-immersion in the  pre-individual.  If  an  animal  starts   as  an  inchoate  plant,   then   a  natural individual begins  as an inchoate physical individual. It is a general problem of modern thought that  a substantial difference between life (natural object)  and non-life   (physical  object)  is  presumed  as  a  point   of  departure. And   it  is  a
