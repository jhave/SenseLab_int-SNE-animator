In   contrast,  Simondon’s   interest  lies   not   in   Law   or   Being   (quasi-juridical distinctions between Being and  beings,  and  an incessant blurring and  reasserting of them),  but in what  he calls, and  means  quite  literally, “modes of existence” of technical objects, that  is, the ontology of machines. In a manner of speaking then, there  is an “essence of technology” in Simondon’s account of machines. But his account does  not assume, on the one hand, a distinction between technique and technology, which  invariably tends toward substantialism; rather his use  of the term  “technics” (la technique) comprises both.  As such,  on  the  other  hand, the “essence of  technology” does  not  pose  a  metaphysical threat in  the  form  of covering  over   Being  with   mere   beings.   If  we  wish   to  think   in  terms   of  a metaphysical threat, for Simondon it comes of dualism, substantialism, and hylemorphism —  that  is,  operative ways   of  thinking and   doing technology. While Heidegger’s notion of “gaining a free relation to technology” might  be construed as analogous to Simondon’s move  to think  and  do technics  differently, there  is no doubt that  Simondon goes  more  resolutely in this  direction, actually speaking of an inherent value  to technics,  which  he calls “technicity”.
