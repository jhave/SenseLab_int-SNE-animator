Now,  I have  lingered on Simondon’s account of the individuation of the crystal because  all  too  often  the  example  of  the  crystal   is  extended metaphorically without any  deeper consideration of  Simondon’s  analytics, and  consequently, every  instance of individuation comes to look exactly  like that  of the crystal,  that is,  physical being.   This  metaphoric  evocation of  the  crystal   runs   the  risk  of erasing the very differences that  matter to Simondon. Simondon does  not simply extend his  account of  the  physical being  to  natural or  living  being,  technical being, and so forth,  erasing their  differences. Again,  he establishes parity in order to account for disparity. He explores the underlying processes that  generate individuals in  terms   of  the  four  parameters presented above:  (1)  remarkable points, that  is, form or structure of the individual; (2) the charged ground or potentialized associated milieu  of the individual that  is at once external contrast and  internal spacing; (3) the neutral point  of the event  (absolute origin)  of individuation that  simultaneously sets off individuation and  arises  in it; and  (4) the field  of pre-individual being,  which  is the specific  activation associated with a  specific  neutral point,   that  is,  the  specific  activation of  a  relation between disparate orders of magnitude that  “potentializes” or “energizes” the process of individuation. In sum,  to think  other  modes of existence  analogically (not metaphorically) with  the  example of  physical being,  we  need   to  look  at  the individual in terms  of a sort of energized topological configuration that  has remarkable points, a charged ground (contrast and  spacing), a neutral point,  and a plane  of disparition crossing orders of magnitude.
