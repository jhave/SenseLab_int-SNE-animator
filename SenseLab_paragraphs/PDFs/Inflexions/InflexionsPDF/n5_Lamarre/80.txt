There  is another concern in Simondon’s emphasis on internal adaptation (which we might  now  also gloss  as a sort  of material involuntarism): he also wishes  to complicate the  relation between technical concerns and  economic concerns. In the context  of the evolution of technical individuals, Simondon’s account implies an  analogy between external factors  and  economic concerns. Thus,  the overemphasis on external factors  with  adaptationist theories of biological development is analogous to economic determinism in the  context  of technical development. In  effect,  implicit   in  his  analogy between the  focus  on  external factors  (adaptationism) and  in economic determinism (economism) is a prescient critique of economism as a retooling of social  Darwinism in the  form  economic Darwinism.  While  Simondon  does  not  deny   that  there   are  times  and   places where economic concerns do indeed determine the direction of technical developments, he wishes  to show  the severe  limitations of thinking technical evolution  exclusively  in   terms   of  a  subordination  of  the   technical  to   the
