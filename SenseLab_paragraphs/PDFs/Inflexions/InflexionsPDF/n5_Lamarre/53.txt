Simondon’s discussion here is not conclusive, and  that is precisely why  it offers a fine sense of the practical technical considerations that  arise between human and machine in  the  course   of  concrescence. Its  inconclusiveness  also  serves   as  a reminder  that   this   manner  of  thinking  technicity  is  resistant  to  finality   or teleology (which  Simondon also calls hypertelia). While one may detect  echoes of Aristotelian entelechy in  Simondon’s  take  on  the  machine, because Simondon goes  beyond form  into  its  underlying and  surrounding  processes, the  finality associated  with   entelechy  gives   way   to  relationality,  here   in  the   mode   of technicality.  As  such,   technicality  does   not   proceed  in  a  linear   continuous fashion. Simondon sums  it up thus,
