As  I  have   explained  above,   the  technical individual  is  a  particular  kind   of technical object (a specific mode  of technical existence).  In the course of its individuation   (concrescence),  the   technical  individual   generates   zones    of recurrent  causality,  both   internally  and   externally,  which   are   the   charged traversal ground (associated milieu)  for its efficient  structuration of remarkable points. For Simondon, such developments bring  the technical object closer to the natural  object.   The   natural  object   also   entails   both   an   internal  energetic “recurrent causality” between its elements and  an external energetic “recurrent causality” with  its surroundings that  constructs an associated milieu.  [17] Now, in   his   account  of  the   technical  individual  approaching  the   natural  object, Simondon not  only  begins  with  the  internal causality of the  machine but  also repeatedly defends this point  of departure. Why is so much  at stake in beginning with   what   happens  within  the   technical  individual,  when  we   know   that ultimately the  associated milieu  is what  runs  across  and  grounds external and internal milieus?
