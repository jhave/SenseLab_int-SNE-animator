matter is  spatialized” (189),  and   as  soon  as  consciousness  accepts   condition where duration  is  spatialized,  “its  fate  is  sealed”  (196).  In  other   words,  in cognition as well as in the reversible perspective of dynamics in physics, in social formations as well  as in aesthetic expression, in order to determine outcomes in the  future, operational control  occurs  only  through the  loss  of the  intuition of every  moment's emergent potential.  Bergson's theory of “creative evolution” as an  iterative process involving duré, memoire and élan vital, helps  underpin both the process movement in philosophy and  the stream-of-consciousness movement in  fiction  and   poetry  exemplified by  Marcel   Proust,  James  Joyce,  T.S. Eliot, Gertrude Stein  and  Virginia  Woolf.  It will  serve  us  well,  again,  to  initiate our grasp of how  irreversible duration gives  birth  to  contingent form  through the mediation of memory, and  how  the  calculus of music  notation serves  a limited but  salutary role  in  jazz  improvisation  and   composition,  but  only  for  those already capable of allowing irreversible duration to dominate cognition, from the “bottom--up.”17
