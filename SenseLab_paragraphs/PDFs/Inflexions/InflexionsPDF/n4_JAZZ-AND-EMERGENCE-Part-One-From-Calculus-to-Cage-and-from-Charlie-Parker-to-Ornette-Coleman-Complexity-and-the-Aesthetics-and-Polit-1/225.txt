here,  since  it offers  a material grounding for an understanding of polyrhythmic textures, built in layers  of proportion in a way similar  to the proportions capable of  generating the  overtone series  with  respect to  absolute pitch.    But,  as  this paper argues, the  time-space geometry of meter  and  pitch,  as  understood by Western  classical   musicians  and   their   auditors  simply  cannot  capture  the embodied and  embedded rhythms and  “blues” notes  of jazz.  These distinctions that I’m making between meter  and  pulse,  and  between chord-scale relationships as represented in Slonimsky as opposed to the  system devised by jazz theorist George  Russell, speak  to the embodied cognitive life of improvisation.
