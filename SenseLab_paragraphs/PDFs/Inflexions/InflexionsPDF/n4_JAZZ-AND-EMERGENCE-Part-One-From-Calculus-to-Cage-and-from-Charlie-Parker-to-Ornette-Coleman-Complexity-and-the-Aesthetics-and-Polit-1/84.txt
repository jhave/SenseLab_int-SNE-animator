impelled to resolve  (according to the  laws  of dissonance and  consonance), and through which  he  proposes polytonal textures, or  coexisting centers  of gravity for the  jazz improviser to choose,  or not  choose,  to resolve  or not  to resolve  to equilibrium, his line of melodic (and  harmonic) flight.   The relationship between these  choices and  the principles of harmonic gravity, as exemplified by tonic, subdominant and  dominant targets within a tonality such  as “C major,”  seem  to bear striking resemblance to moments of bifurcation and  systemic attractor states (in the  sense  of equilibrium or non-equilibrium steady states,  the  references are to “equilibrium,” “periodic” and  chaotic  or “strange” attractors).  We will come back  to  this  point,   of  the  need   to  conceptualize  jazz  harmonic  cadences as equilibrium, periodic or strange attractors, when addressing the modeling of bifurcations in harmonic progressions and  in physical systems modeled in phase space  a  form  of  N-dimensional geometry used  specifically to  model attractor states  in both the physical and cognitive sciences.
