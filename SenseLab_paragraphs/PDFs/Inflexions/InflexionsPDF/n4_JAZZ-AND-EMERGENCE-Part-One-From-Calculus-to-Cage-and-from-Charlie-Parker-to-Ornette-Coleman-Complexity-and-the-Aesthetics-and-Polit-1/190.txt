Furthermore, we find attempts to incorporate as complete a range  of textures possible contingently in the performances of Free Jazz by Ornette Coleman, into actual  compositions with  each  instrument (even  those  conventionally ordained to operate in the distinct realms  of melody, harmony and  rhythm) having independent  melodic, harmonic and   rhythmic resources assigned to  it  as  an initial  condition for  free  improvisation.    For  example, the  composition “Conference of the Birds”  by Dave  Holland contains distinct melodic, harmonic and  rhythmic resources, in the form of motifs, notated for each instrument.45
