7th  (Locrian)  degree of the Melodic  Minor  scale, enables  jazz improvisers and composers to use  often  a range  of particularly pungent notes  beyond the  b7 (or Bb in a scale beginning with  C).  It will be useful  here  to recall  basic  harmony, where in a simple  F (1 flat) Major scale, the notes  E and  Bb (3rd  and  b7 notes  of a C7  chord),   form  a  tritone, called  an  altered 4th   interval, which  is  profoundly dissonant, and  which  cries out for resolution to a consonant 3rd  interval F and  A. This movement towards a dissonant tritone, and  then  away  towards a consonant
3rd  interval, constitutes the  primary drama inherent in both  classical  music  and earlier  jazz music,  particularly early  (pre-Russell) Be-Bop, with  the  proliferation of ii-7 to V7 (in the key of F: G-7 [Dorian] to C7 [Mixolydian]) harmonic rhythms often  juxtaposed without any  final  resolution to the  I chord  (C maj 7) until  the end of the song.
