35 The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, Even, ed. Marcel Duchamp and  Richard Hamilton, especially pages  1-2.  Notice  that  this  passage, though written before World  War  I (1913), anticipates the  form  and  substance of Duchamp’s Given: 1. Waterfall 2. The Illuminating Gas (posthumously, 1968).  As I (1992; 1993; 1994) and others   like  Linda   Henderson have  demonstrated (1998),  Duchamp read   both Poincaré and   Bergson   carefully,  and   fully  recognized the  implications of  an scientific  revolution involving irreversible time  and  emergence, as his  journals and  his  posthumous work  reveal.  I have  argued  (Rosenberg: 1994) in fact that
Étant  Donnés can  be  “read” as  an  allegorical tableau making visible  the  major
characteristics of emergent systems: the irreversible flow of the fountain; the complex systems implied by the glow  of the gas lamp;  the portal to the reclining woman’s womb as the site for morphogenesis; and  self-reflexivity as exemplified by the ocular  subject position of the observer as voyeur.
