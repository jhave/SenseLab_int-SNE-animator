22  To anticipate my  argument, Deleuze and  Guattari's distinction between the bottom-up  contingencies of  smooth  space   (phase  space)   and   the  top   down geometrical  constraints  of  striated  space   (calculus)  becomes   most   useful   in pursuing the analysis of a dialectic  between improvisation and  music  notation in the  composing practices of  Charlie   Parker and  his  cohorts.   What  makes  this distinction useful  is the way  that  it can perform two  functions: Initially,  it helps us to connect  Be-Bop composing practices to the dialectic  of durée, memoire and
élan  vital  described by  Bergson  in  Creative Evolution.  Henri  Bergson  describes creative evolution as an engagement of the smooth space of contingent duration, with  the  striated space  of memory, propelled by the  vital  impetus or élan vital lying  within each individual (qua contributing improviser).  Second,  it gives us a way  to deploy by analogy the rules  and  models of complex systems such  as the role of phase space  diagrams in the visualization of self-organizing processes in physics (Part  One) and  cognitive science  (Part  Two), so to see how  this dialectic of the smooth space  of collective  improvisation, preserved by the memory of the tape   recorder  and   transcribed  into   the   striated  space   of  standard  musical notation, makes  possible the  analysis of the deformations and  discontinuities of harmony,   melody   and    rhythm   enabled   by    the    contingent   moment   of improvisation, and  accelerates the evolution of jazz musical forms to bewildering levels of complexity in fifteen years, a very short  period of time from a historian’s perspective  on   music.       It   is   important  to   recognize  that   this   evolution encompasses melody, harmony  and  rhythm--not only  the  ways  in  which   the melodic solos  of  Charlie   Parker and  his  followers surpass in  complexity and sophistication the work  of earlier  performers identified with  “Swing” music,  the saxophone of Lester  Young  and  trumpet of Louis  Armstrong, but  also includes
