proto-theory of emergence in describing the history of the improvisation, transcription and  composition practices of Be-Bop  musicians ; and  the  crucial role  of  bifurcation  for  emergent  systems in  physics and   chemistry  (and   the related philosophical concept of individuation from  Gilles  Deleuze and  Gilbert Simondon, which  I discuss further in  Part  Two),  and  melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic “forks-in-the-road” in the  evolution of jazz from  Parker to Coleman-- particularly with  reference to the  monumental contributions of George  Russell, who Bordo does not address at all.  Still, this is a fine piece of work  especially for its   superb  analysis  of   “patterns”  in   the   “chaos”  of   contemporary  “free” expression.
