This   distinction   between   time-reversible  and    time-irreversible  systems   is important for two reasons:  First, the distinction itself results from how  scientists observe the  natural world, so that  it is implicated in cognition.   In terms  of the reversible perspective, all events  are assumed to be reducible to a geometric map of causality that  can  be replicated precisely.  From  the  irreversible perspective, the  event  is understood from  the  beginning as involved in so many  randomly variable  factors   that   an   eventâ€™s  exact   mapping  into   the   geometry  of  strict temporal causality (one  way  to  define  calculus) becomes  impossible.   Second, this  distinction plays   itself  out  institutionally  in  a  social  milieu,   because an embrace of one or the other  perspective determines decisions concerning the disciplinary procedures for knowing in physics or in cognitive science.   In other words, this distinction has ideological weight, which  affects how  knowledge gets made  in individual disciplines, including that  of computer science  and  artificial intelligence, but  which,  I have  argued, has  implications for  understanding the relationship between aesthetics and  politics  as  well.    I am  proposing that  this distinction performs powerful work  in  understanding the  avant-garde posture generally, and  the  history of jazz as artistic  expression of a minortarian culture, specifically.
