with  one (3 or E against the b7 or Bb) or two tri-tones (added b9 or Db against the
5 or G in the C triad  C-E-G) in Be Bop; and  then  the much  more  complex process involving continual forkings possible in advanced avant-garde ensembles, where the entire  ensemble might  deviate from a given  chord  structure and  end  up very distant or “outside” the initial  conditions (indeed), with  each instrument capable of its  own  harmonic and  rhythmic trajectory independent  of the  others.    The rules  by which  these  cascading deviations might  “work” from  the  view  of jazz harmony are  extremely complex and  rigorous, and  this  essay  will  only  hint  at how  the logics of this complex system of harmonic deviations can succeed as coherent musical expression.
