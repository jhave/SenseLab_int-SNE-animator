In  order  to  understand  bifurcations, we   need   to  understand  how   the   N- dimensional geometrical model “phase space”  revolutionized our understanding of complex processes.  Phase  space diagrams are visual  models designed to solve the  problem of  representing  complex systems where the  possible origins   and futures are  too  numerous to map  through traditional methods.  Originating in the  work   of  Poincaré,  The  Gibbs–Einstein ensemble  theory  offers  a  form  of geometry modeling points on  a matrix   of  space  and  time  corresponding to  a range   of  contingently possible futures  for  the  history of  a  system, from  one moment to the next.
