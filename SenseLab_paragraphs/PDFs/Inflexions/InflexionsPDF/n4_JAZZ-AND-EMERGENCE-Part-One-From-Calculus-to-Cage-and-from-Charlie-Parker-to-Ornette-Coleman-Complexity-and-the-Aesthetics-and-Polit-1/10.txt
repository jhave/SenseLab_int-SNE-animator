How  do  assumptions about  duration or  time  shape the  very  different creative processes in classical  and  jazz music?  I refer specifically to the western tendency to spatialize time since the 17th  Century when both calculus, and  standard music notation with  even  temperament and  bars and  time signatures, emerged. Examining these  assumptions may also help  to explain why  jazz musicians often have   the  capability  to  master  the  principles  of  classical   performance  at  the highest levels, but that the reverse cannot often be said.
