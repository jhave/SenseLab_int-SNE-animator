Just  as  "How  High   the  Moon"  became   "Ornithology,"  many   other   standards became  the initial  conditions for new  compositions.  For example, the song  “I’ve Got  Rhythm”  became   at  least  two  dozen  distinct, classic  jazz  Be-Bop  tunes, including  “Anthropology,”  “Chasing  the  Bird,”   “Cottontail,”  “Dizzy Atmosphere,” “Lester  Leaps  In,”  “Meet  the  Flintstones,” “Moose  the  Mooch,” “Oleo,”   “An  Oscar  For  Treadwell,” “Salt  Peanuts,” “Red  Cross,”   and   “Shaw
‘Nuff.”  And,  there  were  tunes  written on tunes,  and  then  again  written on tunes, with  each iteration evolving into more  complex melodic, harmonic and  rhythmic materials, each more  sophisticated than  the original, as in John Coltrane’s “Fifth House,” derived from  Tadd   Demeron’s  “Hot  House,” which   originated from Cole  Porter’s  “What   is  this  Thing   Called   Love.”     Even  complex  tunes   like Parker’s “Confirmation” became  the basis for the even more  sophisticated “Juicy Lucy”  by  Horace  Silver,  and   “Striver’s  Row”  by  Sonny   Rollins;  while   John Coltrane’s monumentally difficult  “Giant  Steps”  became  “Dear  John” by Freddie Hubbard.
