46  With  regard to the history of American Roots Music,  I am indebted to my old childhood neighbor and  personal hero Peter Guralnick, whose  series of books constitute  a  most   impressive  history  of  the   blues   tradition  from   the   delta, through Chicago,  Memphis, Detroit  and  Muscle Shoals, and  his latest study, Sam Cooke  and  his desire  to both  perform and  produce (and  thus  own  the means  of his own production) the music  of his tradition. His brother Tom Guralnick is the famed founder of a jazz performance space in Alburqurque, NM, widely praised, called  The Outpost, and  an  avant-garde saxophonist and  composer in his  own right.
