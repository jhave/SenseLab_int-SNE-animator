We find  these  juxtapositions structuring heterogeneity even  in the compositions of jazz musicians having recourse to the same kinds  of ambiguity applied to both percussive  and   harmonic  rhythms  in   a  composition.     In  the   Miles   Davis composition “Its  About  That  Time,”  from  the  album In A  Silent Way,  we  have distinct  iterative sequences of  harmonic rhythm  from  both  the  bass  and   the piano,  with  the drums poly-rhythmically supporting both.   In the bass, we have a two-measure ostinato or repeating melodic line,  with  a simple  and  memorable blues  inflection. This line then  underlies a three-measure repeating harmonic progression that  is  extremely  complex, with  each  chord   implying a  range   of melodic resources quite  distinct from  the  following and  preceding chords, and suggestive  of  the   difficulties  improvising  to  a  Schoenberg  Tone   Row.   The sequences remain distinct and  independent, only  coming  into  synchrony every six measures.
