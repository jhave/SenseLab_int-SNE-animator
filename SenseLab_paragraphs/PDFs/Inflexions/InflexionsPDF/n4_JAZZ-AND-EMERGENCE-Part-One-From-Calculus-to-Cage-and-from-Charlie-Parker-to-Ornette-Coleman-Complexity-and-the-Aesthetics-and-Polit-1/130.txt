But this is a far cry from the processes by which  these same principles of contingency might  become  applied by analogy to the spontaneous improvisations of Be-Bop musicians. Be-Bop musicians, in effect, deviate from
the calculus of music notation in the form of the "lead sheet" containing the chord progressions and  melody of an old standard like How High the Moon. This deviation becomes  the crucial initial  condition for the composing processes out of which  new, more complex compositional forms like the jazz standard Ornithology might  emerge, itself then  preserved in the calculus of music  notation. Here  we find the relevancy of research by Charles Stivale, Ronald  Bogue and Eugene Holland in particular, who address Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s concepts
of “the refrain,” filtered as it becomes  through Deleuze’s earlier  work  on “difference” and  “repetition,” as central  to an understanding of musical form as a form of repetition. We may think  of repetition in terms  of what  scientists studying complexity call “iterative processes” which  may, to a greater or lesser extent,  enable  differences to emerge through processes of repetition capable of evolving towards greater musical order and  complexity.  This is the prime difference between the “swing” music of the 1930’s and Be-Bop: with  swing repetition or iteration enables  a framework for spontaneity; with  Be-Bop, repetition or iteration becomes  embodied in a process of creative evolution which enables  differences to emerge that enable  greater complexity and sophistication of emergent form.  I wish here to up the ante on those  discussions by bringing to bear details from both music  theory and theories of complexity to
fully unpack the significance of Deleuze and Guattari’s meditations on the nature of creativity in music as de-territorialized “becoming.”
