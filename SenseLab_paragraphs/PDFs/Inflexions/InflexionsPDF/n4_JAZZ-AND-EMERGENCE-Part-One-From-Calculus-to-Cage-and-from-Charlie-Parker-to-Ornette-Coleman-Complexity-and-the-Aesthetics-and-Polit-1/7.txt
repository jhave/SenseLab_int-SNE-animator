Now,  I will have recourse to the work  of Gilles Deleuze and his collaborator Félix Guattari (with reference to other  fine thinkers like Jacques Attali), as well as cite a number of Deleuzean scholars writing on music  (such  as Ronald  Bogue, Eugene Holland, Aden  Evans,  Charles Stivale and  Greg Siegworth), in order to address a number of these  concepts (such  as nomadology, minortarian), with  reference to jazz  performance.4     While  Deleuze and  Guattari use  these  concepts largely  to describe  classical   music,   we   will   see   that   these   concepts  have   particular resonance with  the  study of jazz performance and  composition.5    I will refer  as well  to recent  (and  remarkable) scholarship on jazz so as to straddle the distinct discourses of music  theory, philosophy and  science with  some specificity.  Trans- disciplinary research often  enables  certain  questions to emerge that  do  not  get asked  within a single  discipline.  Deleuze and  Guattari speak  to this  when they exhort   us  to  “forge   alliances”  (1994:  “Preface”  xix),  amongst the  three   main arenas of our  conceptualization of the  world: science,  philosophy and  the  arts.6
But one must  draw these alliances  carefully.
