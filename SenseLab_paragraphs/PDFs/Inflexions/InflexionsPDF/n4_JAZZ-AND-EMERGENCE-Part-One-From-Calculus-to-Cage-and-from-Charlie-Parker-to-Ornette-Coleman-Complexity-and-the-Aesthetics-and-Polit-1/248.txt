33  My thanks to Erin Manning for pointing out the ample evidence for the consequences of  this phenomena of avant-garde posturing with  respect to John Cage  and  Merce  Cunningham. This observation should complicate Eugene Holland’s excellent  point  concerning the genealogy of “habit” and  the refrain  in music,  and its relationship to Deleuze’s notion of repetition (Holland, 2008).
