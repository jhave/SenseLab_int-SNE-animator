The audio files for this essay were  recorded at Martin Thomas Studios, New Kensington, PA.  I would like  to express my  appreciation for  Martin Thomas’s assistance in shaping audio files from  pre-existing tracks,  as well  as performing piano  for  the  renaissance counterpoint  examples, as  well  as  providing accompaniment  for  the  demonstrations  of  various  chord/scale  relationships. The quality of the  demonstration audio files of chord-scale relationships is my responsibility alone.   When  I was  finishing this  essay,  I began  playing guitar regularly for  the  first  time  since  the  1970's,  and  I wish  I might   have  waited another year  before  recording them.   In any case, the process of re-learning how to perform jazz  on  guitar becomes  part  of the  narrative of Part  II of "Jazz and Emergence" in order to replicate the prescient work  of David  Sudnow in his landmark phenomenological study of 1970, _Ways  of the Hand_, with  reference to new  knowledges in neuro- and  cognitive science.   I would also like to thank the drummer and cultural theorist Bob Budny,  and jazz educator, trombonist and educator Nelson Harrison, as  well  as  two  other  Pittsburgh jazz  performers – pianist Howard Alexander and  bassist  Paul Thompson -- for engaging in several interviews that proved useful  for both parts  of this essay.
