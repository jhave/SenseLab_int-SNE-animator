doing so,  Coltrane  seeks  to  widen what   I  call  “the  bandwidth” of  melodic, harmonic and  rhythmic relationships possible.  He  does  so as he maintains the coherence of  the  melodic line  (or  narrative) through the  aurally comfortable shapes (from  the  perspective of the  audience especially) enabled by those  very pentatonic scales, despite the juxtaposition of distant and  dissonant tonal  centers implied by  this  method.   Many  have  experienced this  recording as one  of the most  beautiful and  spiritual performances in the  history of jazz.   I will wish  to return to  this  point   in  Part  Two  of  this  study, as  I  explore   the  relationship between the  embrace of polyphonic, polytonal, polyrhythmic textures, and  the sense  of  the  “spiritual,” which   I will  argue has  a  direct  correlation with  the emergence of distributed cognition of players and  their  auditors. But we  have jumped ahead of ourselves, with  respect to contrapuntal textures.
