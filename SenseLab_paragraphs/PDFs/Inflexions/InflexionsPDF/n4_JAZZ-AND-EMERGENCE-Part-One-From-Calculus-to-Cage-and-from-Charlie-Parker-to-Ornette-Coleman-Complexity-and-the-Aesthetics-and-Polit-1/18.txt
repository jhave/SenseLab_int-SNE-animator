We will discover that  the  laws  governing the  expression of musical thoughts in the  irreversible duration  of  jazz  performance, as  they  are  capable of representation  in   music   notation,  resonate  with   those   laws   governing  the behavior of complex systems.8   While the concern with embodied and distributed cognition constitutes Part  Two of this study, what  I wish  to address here  are the aural  and  visual  manifestations of performance, rooted in a minortarian apprehension of time  or duration that  embrace both  contingency and  emergent aesthetic form through iterative acts of jazz improvisation and  then  composition. I consider it minortarian because of the subject  positions of those  who  create  the art  form  with  respect to dominant culture.  In other  words, I will  insist  on  the African-American, and,  later,  the  post-colonial cultural bases  for jazz aesthetics precisely  because  of  the  logic  of  the  minor   as  spelled  out  by  Deleuze  and Guattari.  A serious problem with  current jazz performance and  research has  to do  with  its dependence upon largely  affluent white  instructors and  students in academic institutions, which  takes  the  music  out  of its cultural context.    Many contemporary  jazz   educators  such   as   Dr.   Nelson  Harrison  complain  that academic jazz performance programs in particular have  engaged in reductionist formulas for  mimicking the  melodic, harmonic  and   rhythmic content of  jazz without having any  sense  of  the  “life”  of  the  music  as  it  emanates from  the culture, which  produces it.9
