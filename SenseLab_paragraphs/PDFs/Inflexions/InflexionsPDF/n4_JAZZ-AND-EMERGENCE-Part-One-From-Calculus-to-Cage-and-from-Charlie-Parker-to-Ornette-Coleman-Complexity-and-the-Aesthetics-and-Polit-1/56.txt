A way to reconcile  the contingent “feel” of Be-Bop musical performance, with  the geometrical and  rhetorical resources dominating the textures of renaissance contrapuntal technique, is by recourse to the  ways  in which  those  contrapuntal techniques become  appropriated by  sophisticated jazz  composers interested in the  rigors   of  larger   scale  musical forms   involving multiple  structures  while preserving  the   contingent,  spontaneous  and   unpremeditated  nature  of  jazz musical expression.  It is this  synthesis of contrapuntal composition with  a jazz improvisational   context    that    will   point    toward  a   peak    achievement   of collaborative invention, made  possible by structures introduced in Be-Bop, and partially achieved by Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane and  his bandmates McCoy Tyner  and  Pharaoh Sanders, Miles Davis  and  his band  members Dave  Holland, Jack DeJohnette and  John Scofield,  and  the  Art Ensemble of Chicago,  especially Roscoe Mitchell  and  Lester Bowie, to name  just a few masters of the avant-garde strains  of   jazz.24    In   this   sense,   the   principles  of   jazz   improvisation  and composition  of  jazz   Be-Bop  musicians  not   only   apply  to   the   distributed, consensual circumstances for radically liberated “free”  jazz performance, but  in fact I will argue that  the conceptual and  intuitive conditions enabling “free jazz” evolve  organically out  of those  Be-Bop innovations.   But  we  should explore  a little more  deeply how  top-down geometric superimpositions typical  of classical physics are also applied to the control  of musical textures in the earliest  periods of western music  notation, so we can understand by contrast just how  profound the influence of jazz has been.
