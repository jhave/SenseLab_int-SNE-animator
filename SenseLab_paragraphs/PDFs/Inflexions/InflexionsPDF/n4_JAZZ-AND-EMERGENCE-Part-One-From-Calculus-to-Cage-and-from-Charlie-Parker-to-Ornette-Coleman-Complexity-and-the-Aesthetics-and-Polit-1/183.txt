But  it  was  with  the  Free  Jazz  innovations of  Ornette Coleman and  his  early ensembles that  jazz reached the  full implications of the  conceptual line of flight begun with  the Be-Bop embrace of ambiguous harmonic bifurcation points in an aesthetic based   on  the  creative-evolutionary dialectic   between the  calculus of music  notation and  the contingencies of emergent form.  For, if every  tonal center of  every  single  chord   becomes   in  effect  a  field  of  all  harmonic and   melodic possibilities, it is only a step  to recognize that  Coleman's Free Jazz simply makes all resources, melodic, harmonic and  rhythmic contingent and  dependent upon the  range  of permutations of the  musical motif  such  as found in his “Broadway Blues,” completely freed  from  the calculus of music  notation, and  completely at the mercy  of the distributed cognitive élan of the performing musicians from one moment  to  the  next.     This  is  the  tenor,   so  to  speak,   of  Ornette  Coleman's Harmelodics (actually Mr. Coleman plays  alto  sax), and  only  a step  away  from freedom even  from  the motif  in the work  of the Art Ensemble of Chicago,  Dave Holland, Albert   Ayler,  to  name   a  few  of  many   others,   like  Sam  Rivers,  the saxophonist David  Borgo has so insightfully explored.43
