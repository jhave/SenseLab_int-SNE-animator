is actually compelled equally in two distinct harmonic directions. In this sense one can say by analogy that while  the term  "bifurcation point"  which  is applied
to turbulent physical systems poised on the threshold of resolution either  toward disorder or toward greater orderliness, these musical moments highlight a moment when expectation and  surprise are juxtaposed, implying a complex system poised at a bifurcation point  between two attractor states.38  While neither of the two harmonic directions is intrinsically more  or less ordered than  the
other,  it is the fact of the condition of instability and bifurcation, embedded in the new harmonic resources implied by altered chords, that indicates that this innovation constitutes a major evolution in the sophistication of jazz improvisation and  composition.39
