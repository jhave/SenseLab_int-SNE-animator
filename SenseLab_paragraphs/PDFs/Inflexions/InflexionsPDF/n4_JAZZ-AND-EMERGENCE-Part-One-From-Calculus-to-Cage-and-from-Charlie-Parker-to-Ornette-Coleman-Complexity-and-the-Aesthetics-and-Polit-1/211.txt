relationship with  irreversible time presented in this paper still resonates with  an older  model of resistance from  the  dominant cultural perspective of reversible time  in a way  resonant with  Bergson’s  account of the  problematic cognition of metric   time  with   respect  to  durée.   This  resistance  is  consonant  with   what Foucault calls  the  “insurrection  of  subjugated  knowledges.”   We  are  talking about   micropolitical resistance  that  manifests  literally as  a  “becoming imperceptible” (1987: 232-309).  Jazz is an oral  tradition, whether academic jazz instructors and  students recognize that  fact.   It constitutes a “secret” society,  as my friend  and  jazz educator Nelson Harrison constantly emphasizes.  It is secret in the sense  that  Deleuze and  Guattari, writing about  something quite  different, state:  “the   more   the  secret  is  made   into  a  structuring,  organizing  form,  the thinner and  more  ubiquitous it becomes,  the more  its content becomes  molecular, at  the  same  time  its  form  dissolves” (TP  289).    One  could   not  find  a  better description  of  the  creative  processes  of  jazz  musicians  undergoing morphogenesis from Be-Bop to “free” improvisation. While Bergson’s critique of cognition seems most applicable to science and  aesthetics, and  I have spent  much of my research demonstrating how  this critique is applicable to the tactics of resistance in  avant-garde art,  the  aim  of  this  paper is  to  insist  on  the  micro- political  implications of this embrace of irreversible time  as a tactic of resistance to determination.
