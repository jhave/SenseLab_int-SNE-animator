In  this  last  example of retrograde invention, we  find  the  limits  to  the  musical rules  governing melodic invention for the  purposes of contrapuntal texture.  In this  case we  have  the  melody of the  first  voice  written as the  second voice,  but with  the  durational and  pitch  orientation occurring backwards, by  a strict  an inverted movement (this is what  the term  “retrograde” means)  as the location  of the half-steps permit.  In the first case, the point  at which  the two voices meet  at the  middle of the  piece  provides the  opportunity to then  recast  the  voices  and their  intervallic relationship according to the rules  of contrapuntal composition, so to accommodate the already existing  voice in a case of forced  symmetry.  We have  here a direct  analogy the principles of reversible time, as articulated by Prigogine and  Stengers, played out  by the  rules  of calculus which  can calculate the motion of the planets, or of the periodic arrival of Hayley’s Comet,  forwards or  backwards  in  time.     The  musical  utility,   both   in  terms   of  the  aesthetic creativity of the  composer, and  aesthetic affect  on  the  audience, as in strict  12 tone   composition  (now   with   respect  to  pitch   defined  by  even-temperament rather than  duration defined by  regulated meter—as in  4/4  time),  finds  itself extremely limited by the arbitrariness of the method.
