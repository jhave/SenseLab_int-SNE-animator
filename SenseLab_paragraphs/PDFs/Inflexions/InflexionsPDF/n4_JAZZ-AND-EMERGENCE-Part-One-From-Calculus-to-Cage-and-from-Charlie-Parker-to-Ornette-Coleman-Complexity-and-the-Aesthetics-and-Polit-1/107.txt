In a strict  invention sequence of a single  melody, repeated after  two  bars  in the second voice from  exactly  the  same  pitch,  the  “flavor” is identical or almost  so, with  only  the  distraction of the  first  voice  beginning a new  melodic figure  or scheme,  as well as the temporal difference in the initiation of the musical phrase, to keep  the  voices  from  seeming identical.  Here,  the  spatialization of time  and pitch  enables  us to refer  to the geometric principle of congruency to refer  to the identical  shape  of  that   melodic  line.     But  other   possible  forms   of  melodic invention involving the  creation of increasingly “independent” (non  identical) secondary “voices”  were possible as well.
