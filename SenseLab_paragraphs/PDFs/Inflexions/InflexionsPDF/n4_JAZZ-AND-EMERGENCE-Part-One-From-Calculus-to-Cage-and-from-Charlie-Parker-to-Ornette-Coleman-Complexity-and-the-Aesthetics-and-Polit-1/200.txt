Many  Be-Bop  performers gathering at  birthplaces like  Minton's in  New  York City deliberately set out to create an art form so difficult  that it would take a long time for imitators to develop the technical skills and  hearing ability  to perform it. For example, instead of playing, and  then  recording on an old standard such  as “How High  the Moon,”  and  thus  have  to pay  royalties on it, musicians would at first  simply record a  reharmonized version with  new  melodic materials as  a vehicle  for improvisation. In other  words, Swing  as a minortarian art originating from  the African-American community, became  de-territorialized by white  band leaders,   club    owners   and    record   company   executives.      Be-Bop,   while aesthetically  enacting  micro-politically  the  processes  of  aesthetic  de- territorialization with  respect to the  epistemological and  ideological investment in a dominant model of reversible time, enacts  political-economically a re- territorialization for the  purposes of returning the  means  of musical production and  renumeration to the “minors” responsible for creating the art form  to begin with.    But  as  more  conceptual  and   cognitive resources  were  required of  the audience to “hear” this aesthetic tradition, the more  the audience, largely  white, came to drift  away  from jazz and  begin  listening to rhythm and  blues,  rockabilly and  then  rock  and  roll.    The  problem is  that  these  more  simple   traditions of musical expression also have  their  roots  in the African-American tradition.  And so,    the    same    procedures   of   adoption,   appropriation,   exploitation   and
