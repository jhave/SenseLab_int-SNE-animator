Be-Bop becomes  significant in terms  of this  discussion because historically, this particular form  of jazz enables  for the  first  time  fully  independent and  creative voices (and  therefore musical roles in the performance) to every  instrument performing: piano,  bass,  horns,  drums.   The calculations for juxtaposing independent voices over a given  harmony, necessarily performed on blank music composition paper transcendental to the deterministic, spatialized vision  of time represented by the music  notation on that paper for the purposes of composing a two, three  or four-part invention, suggest an altogether different kind  of environment than  the contingencies of jazz performance in the real time of lived duration.     This  view  of  music  notation as  a  form  of  calculus involving  the geometric  spatialization   of   time,   can   be   contrasted  with    the   contingent, improvised feel of often  hilarious juxtapositions  of contrary “rhetorical” intent (from  the  music  notation of  the  song  being  performed) during a  Be-Bop  jam session,   and   then   the   fixed   recordings  of  those   juxtapositions   in  recorded archives and  transcripts, which  provide the  further basis  for both  composition
