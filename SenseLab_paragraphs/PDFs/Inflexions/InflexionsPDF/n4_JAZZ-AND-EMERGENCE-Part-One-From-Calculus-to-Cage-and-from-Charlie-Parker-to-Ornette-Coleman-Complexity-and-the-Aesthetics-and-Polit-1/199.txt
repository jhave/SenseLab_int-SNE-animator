of jazz's popular audience in the lurch  as well.  Some have  argued, as I have, that one  primary motive for the  rich  and  sophisticated innovations in harmony and melody during the early days  of Be-Bop were inspired at least in part  by African- American improvisers, arrangers and  composers expressing disgust and  outrage at the consistent theft not only of songs  but of an entire  genre  by derivative white jazz musicians, as well  as by their  radio  station and  record company sponsors, who   then   shut   them   out   of  the   economic  benefits   of  commercial  artistic expression.    This pattern of adoption, appropriation, exploitation and disenfranchisement  proved  daunting  for   African-American  performers, composers and  arrangers in their  attempts to earn  a decent living  in the  face of the total control  over the political  economy of music  production.
