Poincaré invents what  becomes  a widely-cited behaviorist model for creativity: Preparation—Incubation—Illumination—Verification.  In this model he refers  to illumination as the “Ah Ha!” stage  of creativity when original insight occurs.   He describes this  moment by analogy to the  classical  philosopher Epicurus and  his description of hooked atoms:  “during a period of apparent repose, but  of unconscious work,  some  of them  are detached from  the  wall  and  set in motion. They plough through space  in all directions ... like the gaseous molecules in the kinetic  theory of gases”  (1910: 61).  Poincaré describes habitual thoughts in terms of entities anchored in an inertial frame  represented by the  spatial metaphor of walls to which  thoughts are hooked.  He describes liberated thoughts in terms  of entropic processes (once  those  thoughts are  unhooked).  Thus,  he characterizes the  materiality of thought in terms  of the  physics of reversible and  irreversible systems. More to the point,  in this passage we find  the first serious attempt by a scientist  to suggest that  the tendency toward disorder that  we associate with  the “endgame” of thermodynamic equilibrium might  also give  rise  to processes by which   order emerges out  of  chaos.    Poincaré describes, autobiographically, a bifurcation,  in  effect  (and   in  Deleuzean  terms)   a  singularity in  his  thought processes  moving  toward  the   spontaneous  emergence  of  his   monumental insight. He  speaks  of his  greatest discovery, which  forged an  alliance  between two disparate fields, ensembles and  N-dimensional geometry (an alliance,  by the way,  that  eventually enables  the  representation of bifurcations in phase space!). As Poincaré states  of this correspondence:   “My comparison is very  crude, but  I cannot well see how I could  explain my thought in any other  way”  (62).21
