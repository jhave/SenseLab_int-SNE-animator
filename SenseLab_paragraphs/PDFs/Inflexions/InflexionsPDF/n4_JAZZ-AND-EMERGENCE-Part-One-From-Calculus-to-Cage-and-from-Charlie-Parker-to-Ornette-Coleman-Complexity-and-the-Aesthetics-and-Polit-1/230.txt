18   See  David   James  Stump’s   1988  dissertation  “Conventionalism  and   Truth: Poincaré’s  Mediation  Between   Relativism  and   Absolutism  in  Science,” Northwestern University, 1988, UMI Order Number 8811513.  See especially the chapter “The  Development of Non-Euclidean Geometries and  the  Fall of the  A Priori.”  I got a chance  to meet and  talk with  Professor Stump when I was invited to give a talk at the Duchamp/Poincaré conference hosted by Stephen Jay Gould and  Rhonda Roland Shearer  at Harvard in 1999, and  very  much  appreciate our discussions on conventionalism, as well as his bibliographical help.   In my book project   Fables of  Emergence,  I  go  into   much   greater  detail   on  the   complex, mutually influential relationship between Poincaré and  Bergson,  and  their influence on the work  of Marcel Duchamp.
