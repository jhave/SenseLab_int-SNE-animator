So let us recast  this notion of a "fork in the road"  enabled by the contingencies of improvisation, in terms  of how  we understand Be-Bop composition as a self- organizing aesthetic.  We may illustrate the usefulness of the concept of self- organization   for   understanding   the    rhetorical   concept   of   Invention,   by connecting this concept to the process of jazz composition common since Be-Bop. An  “ensemble” or  collective  of  jazz  musicians begin  by  performing with  the preserved memory of an  earlier  performance in  the  form  of sheet  music  of a particular “standard” or  original composition, and  then  improvising in such  a way that the structures of melody, harmony and  rhythm are all contingent at any point  during the  performance of that  song.   That  contingency, in turn,  depends upon the lively creativity and internal intellectual mastery of music  theory by the musicians.  Often  those  musicians will record the performance, note  the changes in melody, harmony and  rhythm, and  then,  individually or collectively compose a  new   song   that   will   become   the   vehicle   for   further  improvisations  also contingent upon the  mastery and  spontaneity of the  performing musician(s) at the next improvisatory event.
