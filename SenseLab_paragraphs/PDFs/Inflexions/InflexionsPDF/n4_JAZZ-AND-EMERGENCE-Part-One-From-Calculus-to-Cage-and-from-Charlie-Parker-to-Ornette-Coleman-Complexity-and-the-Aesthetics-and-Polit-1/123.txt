The focus for these alterations lies with  the eccentricity of effect, as those  aural disruptions contend with  both the accomplished skill of the pianist performing on the most mechanized musical instrument in the Western tradition, and  the expectations for orderly sound that constitutes the affective response of the audience. A Duchamp-influenced project to disrupt the underlying assumptions of the aesthetic game between artist  and onlooker, the result  effaces the
conceptual boundary between noise and  music,  between the contingency of aural entropy (often enabled by deliberate musical silence), and the trajectories of mirroring melodic lines propelled by the assumed laws of musical logic governing the dialectical relationship between dissonance and consonance.
