More on this will become  clear, when we make  analogies between bifurcations in complex systems, and  target chords as the contingent harmonic “forks-in-the- road”—or  what   Deleuze would  call  “singularities”--available  to  both improvisers and  composers, which  are  enabled by  the  complex ambiguities of these hybrid polytonal chords. Let’s simply refer to George  Russell’s intention to propose a  theory of  harmonic “gravity” towards which  particular modes feel
