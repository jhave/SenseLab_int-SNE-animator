The  range  of modal and  pentatonic scales  available to  play  coherently over  a single   Dominant  7th    Chord  is  astonishing  in  the   diversity  of  their   implied harmonic structures, “flavors” and  melodic potential, with  improvisers quite consciously drawing on any of these  resources as they  search  for novel  materials through which  they  might  express themselves to delight in novelty and  provoke incipient affective  activity,  extending eventually to  the  full  range  of emotions, from   each  other   and   their   audience.    Given   the  role  of  surprise  (from   the perspective  of   the   listener’s   expectations  for   melodic   coherence)  in   jazz aesthetics,  one   can   hear   how   conceptually  sophisticated  improvisation  can become    over   a   single   chord    such   as   C7,   how   many    implied  harmonic progressions might  be constructed, how  many  foreign-sounding target notes  for a melodic line can find  through these  resources.  When  John Coltrane once said in response to a question of how  he is able  to improvise with  such  astonishing creativity and fluidity, he said “First learn everything you have to learn  about  the laws   of  music,   and   then   forget   everything  and   just  play,”   it  was   to  these resources that  he  referred.   This  understanding provides as  well  a context  for understanding how  jazz musicians often  comment that  any note  can be a correct note  to play  if you  have  a coherent way  to approach, and  leave  that  note  in the shaping of a melody over a given chordal sequence.
