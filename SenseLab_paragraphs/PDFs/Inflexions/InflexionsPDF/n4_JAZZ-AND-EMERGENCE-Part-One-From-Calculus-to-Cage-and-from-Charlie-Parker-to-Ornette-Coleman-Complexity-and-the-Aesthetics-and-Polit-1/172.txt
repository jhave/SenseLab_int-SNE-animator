We now return to a simple  end-game thermodynamic model, because we can now make  a direct  connection from the direct  rejection  of strict causal  models of physical behavior exemplified by calculus, to more  statistically-oriented models of stochastic complex processes, with John Cageâ€™s rejection  of the calculus of music  notation established during the Renaissance, and towards a more stochastically-oriented diagrams of musical events  modeled on phase space.
We can see how prescient Cage was in identifying a need  to transform the basis for modeling musical events  according to a diagrammatic system capable of accounting for an understanding of duration as contingent and  irreversible.
