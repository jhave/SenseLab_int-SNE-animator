This  two-part essay  inquires into  the  history of  jazz  from  Be-Bop  composing practices of the 1940’s, to the development of Free Jazz in the 1960’s, in terms  of the concepts of “complexity” and  “emergence” in physics and  cognitive science.1
Thus,  it continues my  past  attempts at cross-disciplinary investigations, which drift  from  the  relationship between complex systems and  art  into  the  realm  of philosophy, by  addressing  the  transgressive  and   yet  inevitably  complicitous nature of avant-garde art and its posture towards dominant cultural formations.2
