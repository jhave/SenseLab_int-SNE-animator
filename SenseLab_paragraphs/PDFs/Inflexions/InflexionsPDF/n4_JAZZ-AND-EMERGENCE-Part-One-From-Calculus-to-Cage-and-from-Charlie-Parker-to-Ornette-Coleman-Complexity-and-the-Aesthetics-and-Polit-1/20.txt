opposition to  the  dominant  tradition of  what   I  call  the  calculus  of  western classical   musical  notation,  with   the  primacy  of  the  pre-determined  map   for musical performance under the control  of the composer at the peak  of the performative pyramid.   Yet, jazz  music  has  had  recourse to  the  standards of western classical  music  notation since  its inception.  This “complicity” with  the sign  systems and  cognitive schema of the  dominant musical tradition occurs  in part  out of the pragmatic necessity for establishing what  cognitive scientists call a “consensual realm” which  will enable  the initial  conditions for contingent, spontaneously emergent performance.10   In other  words, while  Foucault points out  in The Archeology of Knowledge that  “the  map  is not  the  territory,” following Alfred   Korzybski, music  notation constitutes a  limited but  useful   map  of  an interior world largely  inaccessible to us.   While  this map  reveals  only  a glimpse of cognitive processes involving sensory, proprioceptive, memory and conceptual/linguistic integration, that glimpse remains sufficient to make  certain initial  claims about  the subjectivity of jazz performers, empirically observed, that will  be  elaborated in  Part  Two.    This  becomes  especially significant when we glimpse,  through  the   matrix   of   western  classical   music   notation,  musical processes of contingency and  emergence that  short-circuit the very  assumptions which  structure music  notation to begin with.
