4  The  relevant passages in Deleuze and  Guattari’s  A  Thousand Platteaus: “1730: Becoming  Intense;  Becoming  Animal;  Becoming  Imperceptible,” esp. “Becoming—Music” 299-309; “1837: Of the Refrain”  310-350; “1440: The Smooth and  the Striated,” 474-500, with  special  attention to their  discussion of the relationships  among  “the   technological  model,”  “the   musical  model,”  “the maritime  model,”  “the   mathematical  model  (multiplicities),”  “the   physical model,” and  “aesthetic model (nomad art).”    Notice  especially the  linking of music,   complex  modeling  in  phase  space,   and   nomad  art.

I am indebted to Gene for his conversation and  support of this project, especially leading up to my presentation at the Trent Conference in 2005, as well as for his willingness to read  an earlier  “iteration” of this essay.
