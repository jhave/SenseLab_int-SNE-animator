Profoundly influenced by  both  Poincaré and  Bergson,  Ilya  Prigogine suggests that  the  spatialization of duration in our  representation of physical processes-- not only the calculus of Newton and  Leibniz  that  Poincaré and  Bergson  critique, but   also  the   reversible  perspective  within  quantum  mechanics, special   and general relativity, quantum  electro-dynamics and   so  forth--actually  interferes with  our  ability  to  perceive contingent processes in  the  natural world.   They interfere because contingency necessarily lies beyond the procedural limits of observation in a deterministic epistemology. These procedures depend upon the freezing of duration into  an  infinite  series  of still  frames,  like calculus, like the endless  chain   of  still  frames   of  a  recorded  event   in  cinema   (prior   to  the juxtaposition  of  montage), like  the  spatialization of  time  and   pitch  in  music notation, for the purposes of operational control.
