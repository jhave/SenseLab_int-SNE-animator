sense  as  a  continuous history would  break  up,  we  are  told,  into  a  series  of successive states”  (1911: 30).  What  Bergson  would hope  for is a form  of science capable of observing that “continuity of life” without freezing time, which  would parallel the role of intuition in cognizing the present moment as a field of infinite emergent  potentiality.   In  a  famous  passage,  he  writes:   “We  believe   that   if biology  could  ever  get  as close  to its object  as mathematics does  to its own,  it would become,  to the physics and  chemistry of organized bodies,  what  the mathematics of the  moderns has  proved to be in relation to ancient geometry” (1911: 37-8).  We recognize now,  of course,  that  what  Bergson  was prophesizing, in  effect  was   the  eventual  deployment  of  N-Dimensional  geometry,  and   in particular,   the    work    of   Riemann,   Poincaré   (that    he   describes   in   “On Mathematical Discovery”) and  eventually Gibbs, in the formation of phase space as  a  way  to  visualize emergent  processes in  physics, chemistry, biology   and cognitive science.
