31  I have  written elsewhere of the  role of chess  in the  production of Duchamp’s posthumous  masterpiece  Étant   Donées  (Rosenberg:  1992;  1994;  1999).     The invisible  floor  of  the  assemblage  constitutes  of  intersecting  planes  of  chess boards, as  if in  N-Dimensions.   Let  me  mention also  the  fact  that  Duchamp taught Cage how  to play  chess, and  played with  Samuel  Beckett on and  off for 9 years when they both were living in Paris.
