Here  we  have  a scale  played over  a C dominant 7 chord,  whose  melodic and implied harmonic resources derive from  the  F Melodic  minor  scale,  with  one altered note  (b13) among otherwise “naturally” occurring upper harmonic resources for a dominant (Mixolydian) scale from the 5th degree of the expected F Major scale.28
