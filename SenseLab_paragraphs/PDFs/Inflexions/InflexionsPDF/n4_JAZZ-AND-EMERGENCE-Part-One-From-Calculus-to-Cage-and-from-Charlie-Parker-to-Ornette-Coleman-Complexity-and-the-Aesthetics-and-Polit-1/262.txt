47 See the movie  ‘Round Midnight,  which  includes in the lead  role Dexter  Gordon as the fictional  stand in for the doomed piano  player Bud Powell,  but who  in his real  life  puts   the  lie  to  the  self-destructive personae  of  those   ex-patriot jazz musicians, This film boasts  a cast of superb jazz artists  such  as Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter,  John McLaughlin, Bobby Hutcherson, Billy Higgins, Wayne  Shorter, Tony  Williams,   Freddie Hubbard,  Cedar Walton   and   many   top  French   jazz artists.    It offers  the  best  version of the  top  players from  the  1960’s and  1970’s, paying homage to the  earlier  generation, such  as captured by  Art  Kane  in the famous photograph of gathered luminaries in Harlem, 1958.   The movie romanticizes (reifies)  and  in  fact  allegorizes the  role  of  Europeans, especially French  audiophiles, in keeping “jazz alive” during those  years of exile.
