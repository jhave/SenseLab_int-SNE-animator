Variations  of  this  mode,   this  time   a  Mixolydian  mode   for  an  altered blues dominant C7b9#11b13  chord  (in the  key of F), has  available within its harmony the notes  of its antagonist chord  a tritone interval or #4th  degree away,  which  in this case would be a dominant Gb7 chord  (in the key of B), which  could  resolve consonantly equally to the  key of B as well  as to the  key  of F.  In this  case, we have   a  single   chord   containing  two   dissonant  tritones,  with   both   chords' dissonant tritones wanting to  resolve  consonantly to  a harmonious F major  7 chord.   Here  a polytonal texture becomes  available WITHIN  a single chord  and  a single,  but  now  complex and  ambiguous mode  implying more  than  one  tonal center.   In other  words, jazz musicians have  the melodic resources, within these relatively simple  ambiguous harmonic contexts, to imply  one harmonic trajectory while pursuing a second one.
