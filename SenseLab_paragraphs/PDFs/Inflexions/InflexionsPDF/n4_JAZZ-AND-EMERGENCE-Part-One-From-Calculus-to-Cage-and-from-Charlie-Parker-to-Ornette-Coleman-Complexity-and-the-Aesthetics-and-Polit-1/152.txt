recorded  with   a  tape   recorder  in   order  to  serve   as  the   basis   for   further adaptations, becomes  transcribed, thus  committing these  improvisations to a collective  memory, which  then  becomes  grounds for composing a new  song  in standard  notation.   As  with   “Ornithology” this  new  song  then   becomes   the vehicle   for  further  improvisations  of  greater  sophistication  and   complexity. These  improvisations, in  turn,  may  or  may  not  become  preserved in  another, even more  advanced jazz composition.
