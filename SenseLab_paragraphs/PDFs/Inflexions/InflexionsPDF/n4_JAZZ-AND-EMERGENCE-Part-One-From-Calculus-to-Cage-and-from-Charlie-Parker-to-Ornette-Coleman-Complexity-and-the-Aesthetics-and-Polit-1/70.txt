In  each   case,  the   displacement  of  the   half   step   contributes  to  a  profound displacement  of  the  melodic feel  or  “flavor”, harmonic  logic  and   emotional content.  For example, the  earlier  the  placement of a half  step  in the  scale,  the more  emotionally dark  the musical expression: Ionian  (Do), Lydian (Fa), Mixolydian (So) modes, which  have  the  initial  half step  between the  3rd  and  4th notes  or  above,  tend  to  brighten the  affect;  conversely, Dorian (Re), Phrygian (Me),  Aeolian   (La)  and   Locrian   (Ti)  modes,  which   have   the  initial   half-step between the  2nd  and  3rd, or below  between the  1st  and  2nd  notes,  tend  to darken the affect. Rather  than  simply argue that  the sound emerging out of the darkness of silence  initiates, in the  language of philosopher Brian  Massumi “an  incipient affective  potential” (2002: 30), I suggest that  scales with  ½ step  intervals early  in the scale move  beyond to evoke  a more  somber emotive response as well, which, within a long western musical tradition, becomes  a learned response by both performers and audience (but much  more  on this in Part Two).
