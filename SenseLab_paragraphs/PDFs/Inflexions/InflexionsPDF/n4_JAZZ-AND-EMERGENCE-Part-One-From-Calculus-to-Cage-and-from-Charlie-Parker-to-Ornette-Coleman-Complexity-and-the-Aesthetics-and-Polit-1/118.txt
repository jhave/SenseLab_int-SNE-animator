and  renaissance counterpoint as a model for understanding jazz improvisation according to rules,  not of geometry and  fixed forms,  but of contingency and  self- organization. But I think  that  this approach might  reveal  something much  more to  the  point   concerning  the  spontaneity  of  invention,  and   the  necessity  for recasting   the    melodic,   harmonic   and    rhythmic   forms    by    which    those spontaneous  moments  allow   new   thoughts  to  emerge,  new   formations  of thinking that have profound social and  political  implications.  In other  words, we must  understand how jazz as an aesthetic bears much  scrutiny as a manifestation of  the   logic  of  avant-garde  resistance,  as  the   avant-garde  has   come   to  be understood. Thus,  the value  of a detour to a conceptual artist,  with  intimate ties to the  avant-garde movements of mid-century, seeking initially to dethrone the tyranny  of   spatialized  time   and    those    deterministic  rules   governing  the production of music: John Cage.
