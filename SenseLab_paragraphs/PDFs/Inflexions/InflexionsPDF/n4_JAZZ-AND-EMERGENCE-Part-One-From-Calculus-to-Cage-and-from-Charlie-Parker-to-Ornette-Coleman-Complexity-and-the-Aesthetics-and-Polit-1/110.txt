Here  a metonymic shift occurs  in the location  of the half-steps, which  makes  the melody repeated in the  second voice  noticeably distinct from  the  first  voice.   A second, distinct aural  “flavor” occurs due  to the displacement of those  half-steps, that the listener would pick up on and notice as a reflection of a shift in harmonic orientation.  More  to the point,  that  difference in the location  of those  half-steps signals  the “independence” of the second voice or melodic line from the first one. The  juxtaposition  of two  flavors  brings  greater complexity to  the  contrapuntal texture.
