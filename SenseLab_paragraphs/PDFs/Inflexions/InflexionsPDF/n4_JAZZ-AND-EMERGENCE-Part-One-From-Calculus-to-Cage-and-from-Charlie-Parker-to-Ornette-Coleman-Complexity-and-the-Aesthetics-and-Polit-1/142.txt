Beginning with  the  Tonic (I) G Major 7 chord,  the  two  sequences (moving from the  bottom to  the  top  of the  page)  on  the  left  offer  standard resolutions from subdominant  (ii-7),  to  dominant  (V7)  to  tonic  (I).    The  difference  is  in  the dominance chord:  an Ab7 (bII7) instead of the D7 (V7).  This distinction is easily understood by  pointing out  that  both  Ab7  and  D7  share  the  same  dissonant tritone  (C, Gb/F#),  which  yearns according to  musical logic  to resolve  to  the consonance of G Maj 7 (B, G; or B with  the remaining F# as the leading tone or 7th degree implying the  tonal  center),  and  so serve  as substitutions for each  other. So we  can  call this  harmonic sequence a simple  fork-in-the-road or bifurcation point  in the history of that  harmonic progression. The complex trajectories to the right  of these  two  are  more  difficult  to understand.  Here  the  harmonic motion converts the  G Maj 7 to a dominant G7, but  here  with  altered extensions of the harmony so that  we find  two tritones in this G7 chord  instead of one.   With two tritones we  have  a possible resolution to a minimum of four  distinct harmonic targets: C7 (alt); F#7 (alt); Eb7(alt) and  A7 (alt).  We could  substitute easily a C-7, F#-7, Eb-7 or A-7 as a subdominant target, or C maj7, F# Maj 7, Eb Maj 7 or A Maj 7 as a tonic target.  With each following target chord,  the number of possible resolutions  proliferate, so  that,   when  looking from  the  vantage point   of  the original G Maj7 chord,  what  we see is a cascade  of forks in the road  leading to a bewildering array  of possible harmonic trajectories.  In  fact,  one  rarely  comes across    a   continuous   proliferation   of   bifurcations   strictly    from    cascading dominant chords because of how  completely alien  that  line  of harmonic flight
