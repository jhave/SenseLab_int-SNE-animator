24  Some  may  object to my  comparing Dave  Holland with  Ornette Coleman and the Art Ensemble of Chicago,  but aside  from his significant musical contributions as   a  bassist   and   composer  (see   my   discussion  below   of  his   composition “Conference of the Birds”), let me also point  out that he helped found the famous Creative Music  Studio  in  Woodstock N.Y.,  where the  serious study of  World Music,  with  its resources drawn from  all over  the post-colonial world emerging from  European domination, first  began  in  earnest. I was  lucky  to  spend time there  in 1976, and  I performed “Conference of the  Birds  throughout the  1970’s with  my own ensembles.
