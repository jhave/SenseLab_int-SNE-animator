11  One  historically significant example of a successful analogy can be located by comparing the work  of 19th Century physicist Ludwig Boltzmann and  pioneering information theorist Claude Shannon.  The mathematical equation at the core of Ludwig Boltzmann’s Order Principle (S = - Σ p1  log2  p1; or more  simply S = k log p, with  k containing an equation called  Boltzmann’s Constant), describes the behavior of a complex system (Given a complex closed  system, the history of that system will  tend  inevitably to  the  state  of  greatest probability).   Boltzmann’s Order Principle provides a profound mathematical analogy upon which  Claude Shannon  constructs  his   mathematical  formula  (H   =  -Σ p   log2     p1),   which distinguishes noise  from  information in a communications channel (In a closed communications channel or  system, information can  lose,  but  not  gain, specificity).  To confirm  his commitment to the  mathematical analogy, Shannon coins  his  discovery “The  Entropy of Information”). While  I discuss this  in my
1989 dissertation “From  Being  to  Becoming:  Physics,  Hegemony, Art  and  the Nomad in Ezra  Pound, Marcel  Duchamp, John Cage  and  Thomas Pynchon,” as well  as in my  Fables  manuscript and  several  articles  (1992; 1993), see essays  by N.  Katherine Hayles  (1991); David  Porush (1992); and  books  by  Hayles  (1990), William  R. Paulson (1988); Michel  Serres  (1990); and  of course,  Ilya  Prigogine (1980); Ilya Prigogine and  Deleuze student Isabelle  Stengers (1984).  I was  lucky enough to  have  met  Prigogine in  a conference in  1979, and  to  interview him twice for my research in 1994.
