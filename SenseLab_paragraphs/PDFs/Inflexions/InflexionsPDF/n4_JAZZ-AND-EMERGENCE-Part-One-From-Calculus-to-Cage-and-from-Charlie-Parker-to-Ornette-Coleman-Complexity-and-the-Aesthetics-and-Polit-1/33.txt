Bergson’s  major   source   for  the   mathematical  underpinnings  to  this   line  of inquiry can  be traced in part  to Henri  Poincaré, his  colleague at the  Académie Français,  whose  work  on the conventional or social nature of all geometrical constructions foregrounds the  ways  in which  human beings  have  forgotten that they  themselves are  the  authors of their  own  schema systems: the  mind seems trapped by “a latent  geometry, immanent in our idea of space,  which  is the main spring  of  our   intellect   and   the  cause   of  its  working”  (1911:  210).    Bergson demonstrates that  the  domination of human lived  experience by clock time  and by   calculus  characterizes  habitual  human  cognition  since   the   birth   of  the Industrial Revolution.  He  argues that  while  this  domination leads  to  greater control   over  the  natural  environment, it  also  closes  off  human  cognition to always-already alternatives to the future moment, an awareness of the condition of contingency that  enables  not  only  the  apprehension, but,  as I will  argue, the active   deployment  of  bifurcations  or   “forks-in-the-road”  in   the   history  of physical as well as cultural systems.
