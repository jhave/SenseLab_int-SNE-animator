riches  that  these  moments imply.  If we  examine briefly  this  graphic indicating the  range  of possible resolutions given  the  initial  ambiguous harmony, we  can see the range  by which  iterations representing the journey through one repetition of a verse,  a chorus (a refrain),  can generate a range  of harmonic deviations or differences available contingently to a creative improviser and  composer.  Notice as well  that  we  will  not,  given  the  space  of this  essay,  address false  harmonic cadences which  deliberately ignore  standard rules  for harmonic resolution (with respect to dissonance and  consonance) and  culminate in a harmonic target that would be as much  a surprise to the listener as the most eccentric  melodic note.
