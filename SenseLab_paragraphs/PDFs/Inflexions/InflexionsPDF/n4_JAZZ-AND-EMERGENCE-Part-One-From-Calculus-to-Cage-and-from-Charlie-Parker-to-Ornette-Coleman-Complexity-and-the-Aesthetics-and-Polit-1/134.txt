Let us anchor our discussion here with  music history, for we will find the actual practices of Be-Bop musicians, as they move  from spontaneous improvisation to composition, map  precisely onto Bergson’s theory of creative evolution.  In this case, we use a rather simple  harmonic and  a complex melodic reworking from a given  tune  (How High The Moon) to a new composition (Ornithology).   The tune Ornithology emerged from a variety of sources. The opening figure  can be traced to Parker’s solo performance on the tune  Jumpin’ Blues with  the Kansas  City McShann Orchestra on a few sides recorded July 2 prior  to the August 1942 ban on recording (Russell 128; Owens 19-20; 40-41).  The bulk of the song is a rewritten and  re-harmonized version of the classic standard How High the Moon (you can listen to Ella Fitzgerald’s later recording of that standard, how she adds the “head” or opening melody from Ornithology to the many  paraphrases in her own improvised "scatting").   First recorded for Dial Records,  March  1946, with Miles Davis on trumpet, Lucky Thompson tenor,  Dodo Marmarosa piano,  Arv Garrison guitar, Vic McMillan  bass, and Roy Porter  drums, it was released as a single (Dial 1002) with  Dizzy Gillespie's composition A Night in Tunisia on the flip or “B” side.37
