When  Renaissance composers  had  the  benefit   of  standard music  notation to freeze  time  and  to  plan  out  complex contrapuntal  textures in  advance of  the actual  performance, then it was no wonder that they turned to rhetoric, and  more specifically stasis  theory (which  after  all  is  about  the  freezing of time  for  the purposes of establishing the circumstances for argument), the four master tropes, in the form  of musical “figures,” (or "riffs" as jazz musicians call them).   There  is so  much   to  say   about   this   correspondence  between  classical   rhetoric  and Renaissance contrapuntal  tactics  that  I will  restrict   this  discussion just  to  the relationship  between  the   Four   Master   Tropes   and   the   four   main   forms   of contrapuntal Invention.  Remembering the  importance of the  placement of the half-steps in the  mode  for determining the  "flavor"  of a particular melody, let's examine these four examples.30
