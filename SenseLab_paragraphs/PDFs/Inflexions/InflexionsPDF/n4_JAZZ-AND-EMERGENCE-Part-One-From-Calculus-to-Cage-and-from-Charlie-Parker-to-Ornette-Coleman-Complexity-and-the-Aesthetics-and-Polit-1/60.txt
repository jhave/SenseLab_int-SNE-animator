Renaissance counterpoint  pedagogy  becomes   organized by  reference to  these very  same  Four  Master  Tropes.  The  Renaissance musical world borrowed the term  Invention from  classical  rhetoric to aid compositional practices in pursuing the  range  of expression circumscribed by  the  logic  of the  Pythagorean modes (these  rhetorical allusions persist past  Palestrina from  the  17th   Century to  the most  sophisticated contemporary classical  techniques). The reason for this borrowing came from the capacity of standard music  notation to freeze time, and to allow  for the  contemplation and  design of increasingly complex and sophisticated aural  textures enabled by the weaving of multiple distinct melodic voices   constrained  by   harmonic  conventions,  which    are   derived  from   a notational vocabulary, and  which  have  shape in the striated space of bars, staves and   standard  time   signatures:   I  refer   to   standard  pitch,   timbre,  rhythm, harmony--all of which  come from  the possibilities inherent in the sonic "flavors" of particular modes.25
