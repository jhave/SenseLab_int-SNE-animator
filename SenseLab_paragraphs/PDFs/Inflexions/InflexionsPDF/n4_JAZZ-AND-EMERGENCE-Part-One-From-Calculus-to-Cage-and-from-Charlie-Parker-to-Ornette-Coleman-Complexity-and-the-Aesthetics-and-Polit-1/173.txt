We can find  direct  echoes  of phase space  diagrams of thermodynamic processes such as equilibrium and  periodic attractors, in the music  score of Concert for Piano and Orchestra by  John  Cage.  Compare the  bizarre revamping of  the  rules  for music  notation in this  score  with  the  phase space  diagram of the  Evolution in phase space  of a cell corresponding to a mixing  system.  Again,  here  is another score of John Cage to compare with  a phase space diagram.
