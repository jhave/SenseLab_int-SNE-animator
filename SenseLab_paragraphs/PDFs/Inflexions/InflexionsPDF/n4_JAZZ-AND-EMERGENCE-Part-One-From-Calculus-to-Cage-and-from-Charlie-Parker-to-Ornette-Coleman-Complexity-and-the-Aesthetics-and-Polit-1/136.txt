The process of re-harmonization in Be-Bop composition must  be discussed in terms  of the contingent moment of improvisation, when a musician hears  or plays a complex chord,  such as the one described earlier,  the second of George Russell's  scales: a mixolydian mode  that is married to an altered dominant 7th b9
#11 blues chord,  which  is comprised of two distinct and  dissonant tritones resolving to the same chord,  but capable of resolving to a number of other  chords implying other  tonalities as well.  In other  words, when a jazz musician arrives at such a chord,  he is at a bifurcation point,  musical fork-in-the-road with  a minimum of four distinct harmonies as possible avenues to imply  through his melodic line, implications which  may be followed or not after the duration of this chord  is
over.  If we can think  of music  in terms  of cause-and-effect (by recourse to the precise  analogy of calculus), the tritone dissonance of B and F within the V7 chord  of G7, must  resolve  to C and E of the I chord  of C within the Key of C.  If there  are two tritones, then we have a moment of ambiguity in which  the music
