Complexity theory embraces a broad range  of disciplines that share  an interest in the  relationship between disorder  and   order—especially  how   order emerges from  chaotic  conditions.  The emergence of order or the  appearance of disorder highlights the problem of time's  directional arrow, and  this problem appears as a paradox for  scientists in  the  act  of observing. It makes  visible  the  problem of cognition’s role in epistemology, even in the so-called  hard sciences.   On the one hand, the mind intuits that  events  occur  contingently in an irreversible way.   On the  other  hand, in order for the  mind to exert  operational control  over  external physical  events,   it  structures  these   events   in  a  formal   system, premised  on geometry, which  enables  the  mind to identify simple,  immutable laws  that  are reversible  with   respect  to   time.      These   laws,   in   turn,    enable   the   spatial representation of physical events,  as exemplified by clock time and calculus.
