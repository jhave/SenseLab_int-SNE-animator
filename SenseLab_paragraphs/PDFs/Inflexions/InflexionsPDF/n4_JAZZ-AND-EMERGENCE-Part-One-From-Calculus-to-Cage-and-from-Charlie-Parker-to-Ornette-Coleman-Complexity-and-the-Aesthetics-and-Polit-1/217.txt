7  I address this topic as a trained jazz musician as well as a student of the epistemological  processes by  which   emergent,  “forged  alliances” that  enable hybrid investigations of topics  that  traverse science, philosophy and  the arts may occur.   I have  been profoundly altered by the direct  intuition concerning the unfolding of time while  performing as a jazz improviser, and  as a composer who often uses improvisational materials in my compositions. That intuition might  be called  an embodied yet distributed cognition that  emerges spontaneously during the performance of jazz.   At that  performative moment, one senses  that  musical duration is  not  determined  like  notes   scripted on  the  page   of  a  lead  sheet, arrangement or full-fledged composition, but becomes  a contingent, virtual field resonant with  infinite  possibilities, which  seems  to capture what  the Bergsonian tradition,  as  well   as  the   now   fifty   year-old  work   in   the   physics  of  self- organization associated with  the  work   of  Ilya  Prigogine and  Henri   Atlan  (to which  Deleuze in particular owes much),  calls “becoming.”
