Bergson  theorized his  way  to an  irreversible, self-organizing model of physical (and  human  intellectual) systems from  his  sense  of  the  irreducible subjective experience   of   irreversible   time,    largely    due    to   the    influence   that    the mathematician Henri  Poincaré had  on his understanding of how  trapped Westerners had  become  by first buying into the transcendental model of mathematics inherited from  Greek  and  Islamic  cultures, and  then  surrendering to  the  dominance of clock  time  and  calculus since  the  dawn of the  Industrial Revolution.    Furthermore,  this   relationship  between  the  older   and   younger minds  proves  reversible.   While   Poincaré eventually  rejects  strenuously the extreme positions on conventionalism adopted by Bergson’s student Le Roy, and even engages in debates with  Le Roy, he finds  much  compelling about  Bergson’s philosophical work  on  contingent time  and  creativity.18      Poincaré moves  from his conventionalist critique of the social rather than  transcendental nature of geometrical  models  of  physical  processes,  to   a  deepening  appreciation  of internally subjective processes of contingently emergent thought when he begins to think  about  how  creativity manifests in the  sciences  and  mathematics.19  This appreciation, in part  due  to the influence of his much  younger colleague’s work on intuition and  “creative evolution”, compels him to theorize about  creativity as analogous to thermodynamic processes modeled in the N-dimensional geometry of phase space that  he helped to invent. Poincaré’s concept of ensembles, and  his description of their  behavior through N-Dimensional geometry, helps  us to understand Deleuze’s  concepts  of  multiplicities and   singularities,  with multiplicities comparable to a cluster  of points representing the range  of possible futures for  a  system;   and   singularities  now   understood  as  vital  moments of bifurcation leading to drastic change for a system.20   Here  we have  an analogy as
