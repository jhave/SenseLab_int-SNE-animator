In this work,  the precise  mechanical movements of chess pieces, though contingently determined by the tactical whims of the players Marcel and Teeny, become  undermined by the indeterminate ways  in which  the machine would be made  to trigger musical selections that, while “composed”, were themselves governed by principles of contingency. And yet, the entire  "event" was directed, in fact "determined" with  some precision by Cage himself.   This underscores the play between the contingent eccentricity associated with  Duchamp’s concept of exposure (analogous to Deleuzean difference), and  the dynamic, iterative oppositions associated with  Duchamp’s concept of delay (analogous to Deleuzean repetition), as this play is integrated into the determined oppositions of formally composed musical sequences at the mercy of the expectations and  moods of the audience forced  to sit through the meta-musical motives/motifs of the event itself.35
