How  dependent are John Cage’s compositions, by foregrounding the interdependence of music  and  noise, upon a carefully considered deconstruction (in the  Derridean sense)  of the  calculus of music  notation dominant since  those
17th  Century innovations in contrapuntal composition. We will then  notice  how he adopts models of music  notation that  look  uncannily similar  to phase space diagrams of such complex irreversible processes as attractor states  in thermodynamics.     Cage’s  transgressive  aesthetics force  a  shift  in  the epistemological assumptions about  the  nature of duration.  Yet, because of his subject  position as “auteur” for these  events,  exerting top-down control  despite the inherently contingent nature of those  performances, Cage demonstrates complicity with  respect to top-down European aesthetic sensibilities.
