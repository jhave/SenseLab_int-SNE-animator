Now,   there   was   a  deliberate  exploration  of  all  the   harmonic  and   melodic resources available between a tonal  center  and  a target pitch,  so that  each  tonal center  becomes  a field  of all harmonic and  melodic possibilities: as exemplified by such early  jazz modal compositions as Miles Davis'  cool “So What?”  and  John Coltrane's hot  “Impressions,” but  which  become  much  more  richly  explored in John  Coltrane and  Eric Dolphy's Africa Brass recordings of “Greensleeves” and John Coltrane and  Pharoah Sander's frenetically outrageous Live in Seattle recordings.     Furthermore,  ambiguity  becomes   embraced  not   only   for   the purposes of improvising poly-tonal (more  than  one key at a time)  textures. Jazz composers began  to integrate deliberate poly-tonal juxtapositions in actual compositions.  One  of the  most  famous and  beautiful examples can be found in Herbie Hancock’s  masterpiece “Tell  Me  A Bedtime  Story,”  where we  find  the Introduction in  the  Key  of  G  Major  (with  one  accidental), while  the  melody explicitly embraces the notes  of an E Major scale (with  four accidentals), creating a gorgeous dissonance that  also recalls a George  Russell  scale construction called a Lydian Augmented Mode:42
