For  jazz  musicians,  ability   often   becomes   defined  by  how   a  performer  can maintain the presence of mind to cognize  and  then  fulfill artistically a few of the musical promises that  emerge in  a  single  instant of  the  contingently complex sonic  field  of performance, as  that  field  is distributed  cognitively amongst the collective  performers (and  audience) sharing that moment in real time.  For some new initiates into that sonic field, especially those  accustomed to the ordered trajectories of  classical  musical expression, Jazz  can  seem  not  much   different from  noise.  But  as  we  examine those   sonic  field  layers  of  order, as  well  as contingently  emergent   orderings,   become    readily  apparent.14    By   musical promises, I refer to the material content of music  as both  information and  affect, which,  with  respect to  melody, harmony and  rhythm, obeys  laws  comparable (up  to a point)  with  the  rules  governing grammar and  syntax  in linguistics, or with  the  rules  of any  code  for that  matter.  (Here  I defer  the  question of affect, defined as the  range  of embodied cognitive responses to  internal and  external stimuliâ€”from the senses,  to proprioceptive activity  originating from the muscles, sinews  and  nerves, to the  cognitive loops  by which  sensory and  proprioceptive activity  engages short  and  long-term memory, to the  diversity of emotions that define  our humanity--which will be addressed in Part Two).
