Thus  emerges as  well  a  “down side”  to  this  unboundedly  creative aesthetic process, unfortunately.    Soon  everyone  was   trying  to  play   Be-Bop;  but   not everyone wanted to listen  to its strange dissonances and  its unfamiliar musical logic, especially since that  logic increased in complexity and  sophistication more quickly  than  the largely  white  audience had  the capacity to “hear” and  enjoy.   It became  inevitable that  a vacuum in  the  common aesthetic tastes  of American concert  goers  and  record buyers would get filled  by other  forms  of music,  also originating out of the African-American community, but eventually becoming appropriated and  exploited by white  performers and  record company owner sponsors, only  to  lead  to  the  very  disenfranchisement of the  originally ethnic creators of the genre--just as had  occurred in jazz.
