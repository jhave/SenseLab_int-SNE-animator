onto sensory data  by the Imagination, which  receives  that data.   Kant admits that this  superimposition results from  the  need  of the  human mind to exert  control over  its environment. Yet, he attributes transcendental status to these  categories, but  never  questions that  status.  Bergson's critique goes  further in his magnum opus  Creative Evolution to postulate a theory of cognitive freedom parallel to a model of evolution at work  in physical systems.  This theory has had  enormous influence on painters, novelists, poets  as well  as philosophers, theologians, and scientistsâ€”especially the Nobel  Laureate Ilya Prigogine.
