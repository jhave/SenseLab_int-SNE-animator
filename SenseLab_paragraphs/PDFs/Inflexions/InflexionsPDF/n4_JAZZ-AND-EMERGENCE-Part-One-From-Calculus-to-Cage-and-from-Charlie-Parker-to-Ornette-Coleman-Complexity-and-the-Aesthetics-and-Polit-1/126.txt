The noise becomes  acceptable, integrates itself into the parameters of expectation, and becomes  music—that is, sound with  aesthetic potential.  This leads to the obligation on the part  of the artist to depart from habitual rituals, until  departure itself becomes  habit.  Duchamp made  his career on the paradox of departing from obligatory forms of expression while  at the same time collapsing the trajectory implied by that departure: in Duchamp, we have the deconstruction of the “new” as a cultural obligation. We have here an incipient
critique of “free jazz,” as well, which,  by alienating its mass audience through the embrace of an increasingly hermetic complexity, becomes  potentially the “self- creating, self-destroying artifact” (a phrase Calvin  Thompkins employs to describe a dada piece by the artist  Jean Tinguely). It is from this perspective that we should approach the more  regressive and minimal structures of creative obligation represented by the game  of chess, particularly at endgame, in the works of Duchamp, Beckett and  Cage. As I have written elsewhere, the game of chess embodies the epistemological and ideological implications and consequences of the reversible perspective of physics, and underpins
conceptually John Cage’s attempts to short-circuit the habitual relationship (and thus  the established communications channel) between composer and audience by deconstructing the audience’s expectations for the experience of musical pitch and  duration.
