Calculus cannot accomplish this  task,  simply because it must  assume a cone  of causality by  which  this prior  event  causes  that successive event.    Phase  space accounts for a range  of possible causes  and  a range  of possible effects, allowing for identifying a statistical probability that  this will cause that,  while  recognizing the  impossibility  of  identifying  any  such   event   in  the  future with   absolute certainty.  Here  we have  three  shaded shapes representing a system at different points in  time,  with   the  content of  each  shape corresponding to  a  cloud   of possible future conditions for that  system.  Each dot within those  shaded shapes represents one  possible outcome  out  of  a  myriad of  outcomes for  the  entire system.
