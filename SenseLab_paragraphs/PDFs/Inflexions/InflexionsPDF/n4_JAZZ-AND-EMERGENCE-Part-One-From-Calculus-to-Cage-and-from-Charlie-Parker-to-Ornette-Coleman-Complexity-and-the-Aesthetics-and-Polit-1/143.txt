would be to the  “logic”  and  thus  the  sonic  “world” of then  existing  song  form (except in certain  special  cases like the Circle 4 patterns of a bridge or “B” section of  a  song).   Where   we  do  find   such   cascading  bifurcations  are  in  free  jazz performances where the  improvisers liberate themselves from  the  “map” of a song  form.    Furthermore, if we  take  into  account that  not  only  can  one  chord substitute for  another, but  the  range  of modes and  scales  “in  tune” with  one chord    (The   range    of   those   scales   and   modes  varies   widely  from   being comfortably within the  harmonic center  or attractor state  of that  chord  to quite distant and  “outside” that  state,  depending upon the genre  of music  being performed.), can be used  as melodic resources for the  second. We find  in effect, endless melodic (and  implied harmonic) riches  that  unfold for  the  cognitively aware and  trained jazz musician from  one  moment to the  next,  over  any  single chord  in a harmonic progression.
