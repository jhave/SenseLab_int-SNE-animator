Phase  space can also offer models of large scale processes in biology  and  ecology, such as the seemingly random but coherent behavior of entities through time due to  a  range   of  variables.    The  range   of  possible applications  of  phase space diagrams to the  range  of behaviors of large  scale  as well  as a micro-system is thus  enormous, from insect morbidity to larvae  aggregation, and  even to changes in  human  population  density with   respect  to  historical  processes  of "urbanization"  indicating applications of phase space  diagrams to  problems in
sociology and  political  science.  Here are two such examples:
