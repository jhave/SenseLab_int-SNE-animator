To anticipate my  argument, the  rules  governing the  "flavors"  of sound apply as much    to   jazz   as   they    do   to   Renaissance,   Baroque,    Classical,    Romantic, Impressionist and  more  modern styles  of western music.   For, not only  do these half-steps (usually but not always two to an octave  scale) determine the “flavors” but also the forms  of chordal colorings that  can be built  from  each degree of any given  mode  or scale.  Here  it would be useful  to remember that  chords are built by  playing at  least  three  notes  related to  each  other--in the  simpler forms  of chords--because chords are built  from  the  root  note  upwards in 3rd  intervals (or every  other  note from within the same scale or mode):  C-E-G; D-F-A; E-G-B; F-A- C, and  so forth.   For extended harmonies, such as 7th  Chords, which  continue the
3rd   intervallic jump:  C-E-G-B; D-F-A-C,  and  so  forth,  until  one  may  construct chords consisting of five, six or more  independent “voices.”   Furthermore, there are  three  essential harmonic targets framed by a ii-V-I progressions popular in Be-Bop, with  the ii (and  the IV) representing a sub-dominant harmonic center  of gravity (perceived as a tentative resting place),  a V (and  the vii) representing the dominant harmonic center  of gravity (often  perceived as an unstable moment of dissonance), and  the  I (and  the  iii and  vi) representing the  strongest harmonic center  of gravity, the tonic (perceived largely  as “home”).
