15  This  argument pursues such  a synthesis by  foregrounding Deleuze’s  debt  to the  intuitions of  Henri   Bergson   in  his  masterworks Matter  and  Memory  and Creative  Evolution,  in  a  way   that   also  underscores  a  material rather  than   a metaphysical context  for Bergson’s work,  and  which  confronts many  objections to what  some  critics  have  derided as Deleuze’s  “vitalist” bias.  I refer  here  not only  to the  works  of Jean Baudrillard, Francois  Lyotard, but  to that  of Zizek  as well.
