In  his  “Jazz  Improvisation:  Music  of  the  People   to  Come”,   Eugene Holland begins  with  a crucial  observation that  poses  the pertinent question that  this two- part  study seeks  to address: “One  of the  truly  remarkable things about  Deleuze and   Guattari’s  treatment of  music  is  the  way  they  consider it  in  relation to nature, and  as  one  of the  most  creative parts  of nature” (2006:196).   To what extent  does  the epistemological and  ideological distinction between (irreversible) human and   (reversible) in-human  time  also  help   to  define   the  creative  and destructive forces in human society?16  While  much  of my earlier  work  concerns how  this  drama plays  out  in other  disciplines as well  as the  arts,  here  I wish  to ask  this  question:   Can  we  use  the  history and  the  micro-political aesthetics of jazz as a way to illustrate the play of those  forces on a much  broader canvas?   By addressing in  some  detail  jazz  theories of chord-scale relationships, harmonic progressions and  their  harmonic rhythms, as well  as percussive rhythms as the basis for improvisation, and  the role of time in complexity theory (Part One); and then  as the  emergent nature of both  embodied and  distributed cognition within an individual jazz musician and  amongst jazz performers (Part  Two)--this study seeks  to make  good  on a claim  to confront what  Deleuze and  Guattari mean  by Nature, and  the place  of human cognition and  action  within it.  What  I seek are symptoms, in the life of jazz performance, of a material, rather than  metaphysical vitalism.   Jazz  and  Emergence: together  they  may  reveal  something pragmatic about  life itself as an emergent phenomenon.
