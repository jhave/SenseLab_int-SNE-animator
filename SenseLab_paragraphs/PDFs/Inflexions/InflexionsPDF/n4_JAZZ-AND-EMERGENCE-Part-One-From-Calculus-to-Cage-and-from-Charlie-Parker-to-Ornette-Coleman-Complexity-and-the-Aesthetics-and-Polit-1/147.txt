Charlie   Parker could,   in  effect,  engage the  composing  process as  a  form  of “creative evolution” involving prior  existence  of the  calculus of music  notation, the  contingencies of  the  performance with  other   musicians, propelled  by  the creative  energies  of  his   own   “vital   impetus,”  the   use   of  technology  (tape recording) as a form  of memory, leading to a cycle of further performance and composition as  the  preservation in  memory of  that  performance through the calculus of music  notation once  again.    The  fact that  he  could  accomplish this within his head  and  with  his ability  to sense  what  was  in the  mind of the  other players, does  not  invalidate the  model I am suggesting. But, for jazz musicians, this process hardly ever took place in isolation from each other.   As I will address in  Part   Two  of  this  essay,   both   from   the  perspective  of  improvisation  and composition, jazz  becomes  not  only  an  embodied but  also  a distributed act  of aesthetic cognition.
