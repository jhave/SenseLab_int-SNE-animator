We confront here  as well  the  assumptions underpinning the  efficacy  of analogy formations across  disciplines.11   Reasons  for both  skepticism in, and  enthusiasm for,  trans-disciplinary investigations are  manifest, but  the  pragmatic value  for such  analogy formations remains hard to ignore.    That  both  physical processes and  human thought (as  translated into  signals  and  then  projected  through an electronic medium) may  obey  analogous laws  (expressed precisely through mathematics as  in cybernetics or  information theory), presents us  with  a most unnerving challenge to our  conventional understanding of the  status of human cognition and  behavior as it finds  itself in Nature.12    This is one context  for understanding Jacques  Attali’s investigation into  the  relationship between noise and  musical art  from  a  political/economic  perspective (and  which   addresses “Free  Jazz”  among other  topics),  as  we  also  recall  William  R.
