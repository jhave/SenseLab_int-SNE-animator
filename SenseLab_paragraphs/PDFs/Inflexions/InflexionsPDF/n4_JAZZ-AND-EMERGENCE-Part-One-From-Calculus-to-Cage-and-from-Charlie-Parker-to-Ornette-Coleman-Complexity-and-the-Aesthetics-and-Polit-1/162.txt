The explanatory power of phase space diagrams has been nothing less than spectacular. It can map  the trajectories of pendulums, indicating the range  of deviation in  the  rhythmic repetition of  the  swing   as  it  becomes   affected   by gravity.   It can map  the contrast between pressure and  volume in a heat  engine, thus  indicating the  source  of power resulting from  that  contrast, as that  power, enabled by irreversible thermodynamic processes, becomes  harnessed to impel the reversible movements of an internal combustion engine.   It can map  as well the  evolution in phase space  of a cell undergoing  Brownian motion, indicating the completely random behavior of a system approaching thermodynamic equilibrium. As an example of a self-organizing, emergent process, the Bromide- Ion  concentration in  the  Belosouv-Zabotinski reaction demonstrates  how processes beginning  at  random in  the  heat  of  turbulence may  be  capable of moving in  the  direction of greater orderliness, here  with  actual  images  of the vortex-like  swirls   of  the   chemicals  that   emerge  spontaneously  during  the
chemical  reaction “far-from-equilibrium.”
