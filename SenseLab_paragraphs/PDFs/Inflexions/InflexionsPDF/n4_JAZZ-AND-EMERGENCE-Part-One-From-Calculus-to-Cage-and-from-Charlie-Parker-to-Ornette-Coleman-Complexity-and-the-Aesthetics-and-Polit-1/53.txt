Recourse to traditional contrapuntal analysis to describe the circumstances of Be- Bop  improvisation  may   seem  fruitful  at  first,  simply  by  suggesting  a  fixed structure comprised of autonomous parts.    This  enables  us  to think  of distinct melodic lines,  within contrapuntal textures, as models for understanding how  it is   possible   for   jazz   melody   to   diverge,   develop   and    then    interweave unpredictably in the contingencies of collective  performance.    Yet, this is in contradistinction from what  we understand about  Jazz.
