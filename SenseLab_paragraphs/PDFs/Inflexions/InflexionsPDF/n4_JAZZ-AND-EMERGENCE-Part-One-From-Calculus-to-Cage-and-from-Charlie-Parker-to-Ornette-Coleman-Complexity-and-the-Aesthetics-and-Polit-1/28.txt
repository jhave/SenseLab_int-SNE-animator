Winner of the Nobel  Prize in 1977, chemist and  physicist Ilya Prigogine describes this paradox in terms  of the philosophical categories "being" and  "becoming,” in a  number  of  works   written  (one  with   a  student of  Gilles  Deleuze,  Isabelle Stengers) for a general audience.   Prigogine defines "being" as the static representation of  events  as  fundamentally reversible from  a  postulated frame transcendental to time and  space, such as the way calculus computes movements of planets in a solar system, the trajectory of a cannon ball, the interaction of sub- atomic  particles mapped  on  a Feynman diagram) into  the  future OR into  the past.   Being is the inhuman time of mass,  energy and  gravity.  Prigogine defines "becoming"  as the  irreversible and  contingent temporal experience irreducible to such   a  frame,   with   the   possibility  for   spontaneous  emergent  orderings  in turbulent fluids:  such  as bénard cells that  emerge as heat  dissipates through a viscous   fluid,   or  the  appearance  of  vortices   during  the  Belosouv-Zabotinski reaction; the  production of complex chemicals from  simpler ones  (as  in  linear and  non-linear catalysis),  the  spontaneous emergence of coherent states  within metals   and   fluids   close  to  the  temperature of  absolute zero  (Kelvin);  or  the
