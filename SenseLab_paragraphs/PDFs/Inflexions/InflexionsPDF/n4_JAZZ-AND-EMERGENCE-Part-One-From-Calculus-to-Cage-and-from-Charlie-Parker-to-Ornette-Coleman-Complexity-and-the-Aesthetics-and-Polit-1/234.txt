21   When  I interviewed Ilya  Prigogine in  May,  1994, he  specifically cited  both Bergson  and  Poincaré as major inspirations for his research on the physics of self- organization, and  acknowledged his affinity  for the philosophical work  of Gilles Deleuze, particularly his  masterwork Difference and Repetition.   Incidentally, we have,   in  Poincaré’s  model  of  creativity  with   reference  to  the   hooking  and unhooking  of  thought atoms,   as  well  as  to  the  reconfiguration of  the  walls themselves after these thought-atoms are put  into motion, a precise  illustration of what  Deleuze and  Guattari call processes of “de-territorialization” and  “re- territorialization.”
