10  I would like to acknowledge my  good  friend  Mark  Lawrence McPhail’s work on complicity.  We’ve had  many  long conversations on this topic,  because of the fruitful ways  that  our  interests have  impinged on  each  other.    While  his  work focuses    on   how    black   intellectuals   become    complicitous   with    dominant intellectual culture through embracing the essentialist discourse of the academy, my   work   focuses   on   the   relationship  between  aesthetic  transgression  and complicity  in   the   avant-garde  through  its   embrace  of   the   processes  and institutions for the dissemination of the art work,  and  an implied dependency on the consumers of that  work.
