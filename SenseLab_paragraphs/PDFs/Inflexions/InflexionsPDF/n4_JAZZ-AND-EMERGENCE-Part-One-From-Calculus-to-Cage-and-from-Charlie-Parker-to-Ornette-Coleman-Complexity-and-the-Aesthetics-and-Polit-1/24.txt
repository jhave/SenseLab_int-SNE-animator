I argue that  the  intuition of contingent and  irreversible time  of even  mediocre jazz  musicians (such  as  myself)  becomes   implicated in  a  profound argument with  the history and  philosophy of science, as well as social philosophy, over the origins   and   consequences  of  particular  models  of  duration in  physical  and cognitive  systems,  and    in   intellectual  and    organizational   systems.     This argument, in turn,  may have much  to say about  how creativity and  invention can be construed as generally as possible (effacing  the  boundary between birds  and humans as originators of creative expression through sound, for example, as Deleuze and  Guattari seem to argue).15
