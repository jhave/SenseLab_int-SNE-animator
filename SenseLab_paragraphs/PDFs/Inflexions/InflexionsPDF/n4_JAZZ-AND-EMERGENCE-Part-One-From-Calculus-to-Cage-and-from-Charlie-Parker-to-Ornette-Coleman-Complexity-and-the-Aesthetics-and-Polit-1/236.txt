the introduction of poly-tonal clusters by Thelonious Monk,  the juxtaposed (and competing)  primary  (polytonal) triads  of  Bill  Evans,   as  well   as  ambiguous chordal  voices   in  4ths   (rather  than   3rds)   of  McCoy   Tyner—to  name   three influential pianists, and, the pioneering poly-rhythmic textures of drummers Kenneth  Clarke   and   Max  Roach—culminating  in  the  achievements  of  Elvin Jones. This breakdown of the logic of standard melodic, harmonic and  rhythmic resolution leads  eventually  to  new  chord-scale relationships,  harmonic progressions both  complex and  tonally ambiguous, and  new  forms  of collective improvisation as exemplified by the work  of Charles Mingus, Miles Davis,  John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy, Ornette Coleman, and  eventually, the  Art  Ensemble of Chicago,   Dave  Holland, Albert   Ayers,   Sam  Rivers  and   many   others.     Poly- tonality, poly-rhythms, and  contingent, spontaneously performed contrapuntal textures all become  possible because of the  “creative evolution” of the  musical lines of flight of Be-Bop performers and  composers.
