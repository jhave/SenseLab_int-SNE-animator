Phase  space diagrams map  the accumulation of a set of points representing a range  of locations that can be defined as vicinities that are irreducible to the matrix  of the horizontal of space and the vertical  of time, with  each point/vicinity representing one future for the entire  system. This irreducible “set of points” describes the concept of “ensembles” in phase space, which
