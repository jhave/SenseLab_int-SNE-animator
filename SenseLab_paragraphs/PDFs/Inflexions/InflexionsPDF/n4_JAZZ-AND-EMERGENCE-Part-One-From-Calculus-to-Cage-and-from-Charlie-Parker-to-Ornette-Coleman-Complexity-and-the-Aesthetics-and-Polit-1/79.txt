Here  we  have  a scale  played over  a C dominant 7 chord,  whose  melodic and implied harmonic resources derive from  the  G Melodic  Minor  scale,  with  one altered (#11 or Lydian) note among otherwise naturally occurring harmonic resources for a sub-dominant (Lydian) scale, but  which  has  a b7 note,  and  thus contributes to the melodic resources of dominant 7 chords. Here,  we have  a scale played  over   a  C  dominant  7  chord,   whose   melodic  and   implied  harmonic resources derive from the Db Melodic  Minor  scale, with  no less than  four altered notes  (b9,  #9.  #11,  b13) among the  resources in  this  very  dissonant (1/2 step away)  tonal  center  away  from  the actual  chord,  and  a minor  third interval from the targeted tonal  center  (F).
