While paying heed  to the history of research on entropy in terms  of the endgame of thermodynamic equilibrium, Prigogine seeks  to include those  processes that involve a movement toward greater orderliness and  complexity.   The result  of his work  in statistical mechanics to formalize non-equilibrium thermodynamics (or  as  the  physicist Erwin  Schödinger coined   it in  What  Is Life? twenty years earlier,  negentropy [negative entropy]) can be called  the first sophisticated theory of self-organization. The  differences between the  deterministic cast  of Western classical  music  and  the  celebratory contingency of  African-American  classical music,  finds  a  tentative meeting place  in  what  I am  calling  the  “calculus” of standard music  notation. Furthermore the  problems reconciling these  two  aural worlds bear  a  striking relationship to  what   Prigogine and  Stengers call  “The Clash”  of the cultures of time.   We will see that  the connection between calculus
