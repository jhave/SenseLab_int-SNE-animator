While  I might  want  to finesse  the  distinction between what  is dominant (in the  cultural studies sense  of “hegemonic”) with Deleuze and  Guattari’s machineries of “control” and  processes of “becoming,”  I think  we  are  too  quick  to  efface  the  continued conditions of suppression with respect to  the  complex intertwinings  of political,  economic and  social  forces— especially where the  condition of African-Americans in the  United States  is concerned.3
