The simultaneous juxtaposition of competing harmonic textures in “Broadway Blues,” which  are implicated in the melodic “lines of flight,”  to be employed contingently, and  at will, by bass, piano,  and  horn,  over  the complex alternating (and   implied juxtaposed  time  signatures) of  polyrhythmic drums,  makes   for difficult  listening.  This is especially true  for those  with  certain  expectations that the  specific  roles  of  a  melody instrument  like  the  saxophone,  the  harmony instrument like  the  piano,   and   the  rhythm instrument of  the  drums remain consistent and  predictable.  Yet, if the listener as well as the performer of jazz has learned anything since Be-Bop, it is the celebration of the contingently inter- subjective experience of pure  time which  structures the heterogeneity of aural textures and  provides a unity  amidst the diversity of expression.
