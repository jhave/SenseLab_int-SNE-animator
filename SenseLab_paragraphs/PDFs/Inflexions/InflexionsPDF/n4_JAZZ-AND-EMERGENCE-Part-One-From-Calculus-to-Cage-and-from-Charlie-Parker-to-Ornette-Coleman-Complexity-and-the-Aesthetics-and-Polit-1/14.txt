How  we  may  identify processes of de-territorialization and  re-territorialization, and   the  iterative, emergent  or  self-organizing nature  of  the  refrain   (and   of harmonic rhythm generally), as central  to an understanding of the micro-political motivations of an  aesthetic?   We  will  also  see  how  a shift  from  the  model of calculus to the  model of phase space  in conceptualizing the  nature of duration enables  us to theorize, and  visualize, the crucial  role of systemic bifurcations: in both  complex processes from physics (and  cognitive science in Part Two), and  in jazz.   We will  be able  to locate  systemic bifurcations with  reference to melodic resources, the  adaptive nature of harmonic structures with  respect to  tonality, and  the rhythms of harmonic progressions as well as percussive rhythms.
