40  We could  easily  apply, as I have  done  in research on  avant-garde architects Arakawa and  Madeline Gins, the language of phase space  and  of emergent, bifurcating  systems,  in  a  discussion  of  bodies   moving through  architectural spaces  (Rosenberg: 2002; 2009-forthcoming).    More  significant work  on embodiment and  emergence can be found in Erin Manning’s work  on dance  with respect to  “becoming” and  “incipient action.”      See her  just  published Relationscapes: Movement, Art, Philosophy, especially 13-28.  See as well Manning’s discussion of Arakawa and  Gins in the last chapter of this volume.
