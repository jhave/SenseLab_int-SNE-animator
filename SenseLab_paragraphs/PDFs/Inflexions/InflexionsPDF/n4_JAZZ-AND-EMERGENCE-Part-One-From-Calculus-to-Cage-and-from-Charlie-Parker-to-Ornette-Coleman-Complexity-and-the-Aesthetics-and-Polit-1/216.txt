6 The problematics of analogy formation and the construction of correspondences is central  to my theoretical concerns, first articulated skeptically in my article  on tropes of the  subject  in Freud and  Deleuze and  Guattari (1993); and  more  fully realized enthusiastically in my development of a model of emergent (and transgressive) trans-disciplinary inquiry.  See “Chess RHIZOME and  Phase  Space: Mapping Metaphor Theory  Onto  Hypertext Theory” (1999; translated into Portuguese, 2002).   I argue that  the  concept of metaphor (and  meaning tropes and  analogies generally) can  be recuperated from  a Deleuzean perspective, by recasting the  function of tropes generally as  “tools”  with  “agency” capable of performing work  (much  in the way  Bruno  Latour and  Peter  Galison  discuss the exchange of tools in science  generally, and  computer hardware and  software specifically).  In this way,  the question of “identity” becomes  discarded, and  the issue  of the  “event” of emergent juxtaposition of allied  conceptual questions in distinct disciplines, becomes  foregrounded. I believe  this to be the underpinning to Deleuze’s exhortation to “forge  alliances” despite his critique of metaphor and analogy as forms  of transcendental identity.  The process of forging alliances exemplifies the  condition of emergence, as the  hybrid disciplines of complexity studies, cognitive science and  nanotechnology demonstrate.   The theoretical problems underpinning this  particular issue  of the  cultural work  of metaphor with  respect to the relationship between jazz and  emergence, formed the basis of my  presentation on “Jazz  as a Viral Metaphor” at the  NSF Seminar in Honor of Peter  Galion's   notion of  the  “Trading Zone,”   ASU,  2006—a  talk  available in quick-time  video   online   at:      .  See  also  my  forthcoming  essay:  “Reconciling Deleuze’s  Rejection  of Metaphor with  His  Plea  to Forge  Disciplinary Alliances: Tropology as an Emergent Property in Difference and Repetition,” first  presented at a panel  I created for the Modern Language Association entitled “Between Semiotics  and  Geometry: Metaphor, Science and  the Trans-Disciplinary ‘Trading Zone’,” with  guest  speakers Peter  Galison,  Brian  Rotman, Ken Knoespel, James Bono, James Paxson  and  Arielle Saiber, Dec. 28, 2004.
