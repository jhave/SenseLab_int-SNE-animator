Here  we have  a repetition of a melody, with  a certain  “flavor,” in a second voice at twice  the  speed of the  first  occurrence (which  alters  the  aesthetic affect  in a different way  despite the  repetition of melodic shape).    The opposite was  often employed:  a  melody introduced  at  the  beginning  of  an  invention might   be repeated at twice  the notational duration.  These two tactics create  poignant and reflective moments that  fix the feel of a particular melody in the listener's mind and  enable  a whole  array  of variations for the  elaboration of a musical topoi:  a classical  version of this  can  be  found in  the  opening sequence of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.
