Seigworth’s essay  “Fashioning a Stave, Or, Singing  Life” does  not address music directly except through the allusion to music  notation, its link of the “stave” with the  dominant epistemological and  ideological entrapment in the  geometries of cognition, and  “singing a life” with  strategies of resistance and  liberation from those  geometries, and  linking these  oppositions to Freud’s life and  death drives, is superbly insightful.
