For these  two  diagrams, we have  representations in phase space  of the range  of possible outcomes with  respect to systemic behavior over time.  The first refers to the  correlation of the  presence of specific  chemicals in the  environment to the starvation of a specific  insect  population.  The second refers  to the  aggregating behavior of larvae  over time in response to specific stimuli, with  aggregation understood as  fine  example of  a  self-organizing process applied  to  biological systems, with  other,  more  familiar examples being the behavior of prairie grasses and  slime mold.
