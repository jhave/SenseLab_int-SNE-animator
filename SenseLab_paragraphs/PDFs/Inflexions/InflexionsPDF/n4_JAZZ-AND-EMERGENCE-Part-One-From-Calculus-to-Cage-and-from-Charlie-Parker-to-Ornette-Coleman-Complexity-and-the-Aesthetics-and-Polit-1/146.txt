statement is apocryphal.40    The  fact  of the  distributed nature of the  composing process, which  occurs  through several  iterations among several  hands, actually strengthens the case that  I am trying to make  here,  but more  on that  in Part Two. This  does  not mean  that  Parker was  illiterate: far from  it.   There  are  numerous recountings of Parker reading through a complex arrangement once, not looking at it again  for days,  and  then  playing it flawlessly from memory. By all accounts he had  a photographic memory, and  it remains unfortunate that  many  still hold that  the  jazz aesthetic must  be somehow “natural” and  primitive.  While  I will finesse  the term  “natural” here  for productive purposes by suggesting that  there is an alliance  or a common linkage between the minortarian state and an embrace of irreversible duration, I find its use suggests the continual underestimating the intellectual prowess of jazz musicians (as both  performers and  composers fully cognizant of Western classical  music)  as part  of a history of the  patronizing of African-American culture.
