The  initial  conditions for  such  systemic transformations  are  mapped in  phase space  by  reference to  what  are  called  “bifurcations” and  one  can  see  how  the metaphor “fork-in-the-road” works  as we  examine these  next  two  diagrams of bifurcations,  the  first  mapping a  simple   bifurcation  indicating  two   or  three possible  outcomes  for   the   history  of   the   system,  the   second  a   complex, bifurcation which  indicates the  instability of cascading branchings pointing to potentially infinite  number of outcomes.
