Here we have a scale played over a C dominant 7 chord,  whose  melodic and implied harmonic resources derive from the G Melodic  Minor  scale, with  one altered (#11 or Lydian) note among otherwise naturally occurring harmonic resources for a sub-dominant (Lydian) scale, but which  has a b7 note, and thus contributes to the melodic resources of dominant 7 chords.
