neglected volume The Noise of Culture.   Paulson’s work  remains particularly apt, since,   by   following  the   work   of   Michel   Serres’   explorations  of   noise   in cybernetics, and  Serres’  fascination with  the  relationship between “noise” and “emergence,” Paulson argues that all of literary aesthetics (and by implication, all artistic  expression) emerges spontaneously from  the  noise/entropy  of modern, technologically-driven cultural (and  therefore informational) cacophony.13   Since the  large  literature on emergence or self-organization now  spans  the  disciplines of physics, chemistry, biology,  cybernetics, computer science, cognitive science to name  a few, we may  find  such  analogy formations extremely useful  in understanding the  complex nature of spontaneous creativity expressed through African-American classical  music  and  find  analogies between jazz performance and  the behavior of emergent systems compelling.
