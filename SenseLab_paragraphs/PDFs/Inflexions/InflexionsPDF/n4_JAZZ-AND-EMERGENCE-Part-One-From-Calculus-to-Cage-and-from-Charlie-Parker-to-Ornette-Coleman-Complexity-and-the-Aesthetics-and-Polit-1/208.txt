invention in real-time multi-object-oriented  environs as analogous to both  jazz improvisation and  the science of “emergence”, I have  presented several  times  at the  Computers and  Writing Conference, including June  1, 1996; Conference on College  Composition and  Communication, March,  1998.  I also created in 1989, with   Thomas  I.  Ellis,  an   instructional  software  program  called   RHIZOME, modeling creative and  analytic heuristics, based  in part  on  iterative non-linear sequences from  complex systems, and  in part  on  the  iterative processes of jazz improvisation and  composition, and  modeled in hypertext for users  to emulate, including   one    called    “Jazz    Writing.”   The    results,   and    its    theoretical underpinnings were  published in “Physics and  Hypertext: Liberation and Complicity in  Art  and  Pedagogy,” Hyper/Text/Theory,  ed.  George  W. Landow, Johns  Hopkins UP, 1994, 393-443; Contingency, Liberation and  the  Seduction of Geometry:   Hypertext  as  an   Avant-Garde  Medium,”  Perforations  3,  Spring- Summer 1992: After the Book: Special Issue on Hypertext,  ed.
