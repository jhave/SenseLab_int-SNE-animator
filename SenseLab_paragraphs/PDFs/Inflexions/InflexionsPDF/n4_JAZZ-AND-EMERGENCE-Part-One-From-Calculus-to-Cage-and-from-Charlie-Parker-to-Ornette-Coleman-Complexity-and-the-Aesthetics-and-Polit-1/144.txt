Here  we  have  bifurcation points or  “forks-in-the-road” leading to  a  range   of implied or explicit  differences or deviations from  the  given  map  in the  calculus of music  notation of the lead sheet: implied if the jazz improviser seeks to merely “suggest” the  foreign  harmonic deviation for  the  purposes of creative melodic de-territorialization;  explicit  if the  jazz  improviser wishes  to spontaneously re- harmonize the song,  to re-territorialize the calculus of music  notation to his own harmonic and  melodic, and,  eventually, compositional purposes, by  departing from  the  song  structure  entirely.   We  can  compare this  again  by  analogy, to Poincaré’s account (see above)  in his dream of dissolving the walls themselves as well  as  the  unmooring of  atoms   attached by  hooks  to  those  walls.    How  an ensemble  of  jazz   musicians  can   spontaneously  make   these   decisions  in   a collective  and  consensual way, in the contingencies of real-time performance, constitutes one of the topics for Part Two of this essay.
