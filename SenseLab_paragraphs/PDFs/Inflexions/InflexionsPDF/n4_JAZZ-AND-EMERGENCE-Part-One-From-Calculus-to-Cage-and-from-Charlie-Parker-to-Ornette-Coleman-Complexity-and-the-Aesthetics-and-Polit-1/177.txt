explore    harmonic   progressions   that    celebrate   the    absence    of   immediate resolution.   In  other   words,  compositions like  John  Coltrane's “Giant   Steps” represent the apotheosis of attempts to offer, within the “logic” of harmonic flow, pivotal  dominant  chords  that   not   only   did   not   resolve   as  expected  (false cadences),   but   which    did    much    to   explore    in   extremely  abstract   ways relationships among distant harmonies that  pointed towards hybrid harmony and  melody, often  presented in dense  and  complex "sheets"  of sound. In these two works,  we have  an implied phase space model of harmonic movement, with no  determined  resolution.   For  example, in  “Giant   Steps,”  we  have  coherent harmonic motion despite symmetrical tonal  centers  exactly  a major third interval apart (G, B, Eb), with  no  center  weighted over  the  other,  nor  any  compelling musical   logic   governing   that    harmonic  motion  through   traditional   V7-I dissonance-consonance  resolutions.    These   harmonic  progressions  might   be likened  by  analogy  to  non-equilibrium  periodic  attractor  states   in thermodynamics,  with   the  musical  composition  “system”  shifting  from   one attractor state  to the next in sequence, and  without any final attractor state  (such as equilibrium—as in the endgame analogy) achieved, except  at the ending, and often, not even then.41
