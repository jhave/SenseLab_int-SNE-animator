equilibrium, or systems-death of the game itself, which  both players seek to avoid as long as possible (and it is in fact the “creative obligation” of those players to use the creative ingenuity of their minds to find patterns of avoidance). Yet circumstantial evidence abounds suggesting that he had (see note 22).  For example, in the last "chess performance" which  included Teeny Duchamp playing chess (Toronto, 1968) within a Cage “event”, each square on the board contained a photoelectric cell, wired to trigger separate tape machines when a chess piece came in contact  with  the square. Upon  the contingent
stimulus of deliberated yet unpredictable moves,  those  tapes  would play random selections of compositions by David  Tudor, Lowell Cross and other  classical composers, as well as by Cage himself.   Here determinacy and  chance  play themselves out non-dialectically on a chessboard dominated by tensions between reversible and irreversible time, with respect to the composer as the aesthetically deterministic “auteur”, and  the contingencies of the movements of chess pieces
in real time which  trigger randomly iterative performances of those  determined compositions scripted according to contingent and  statistically modeled compositional practices.34
