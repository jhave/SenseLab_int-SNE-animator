only  for students of improvisation, but  for jazz improvisers wishing to become composers  (Russell   1973,  181-3).    So  here  is  the  "chorus"   for  my  argument, precisely in the Bergsonian terms  underscoring his vitalist  model of creative evolution, but here recasting it in materialist terms  applying to both physical and cognitive domains.  The preserved memory enabled by the  tape  recording of the contingent  moment, recast  in  the  spatialized time  of  standard music  notation through transcription, enables  contingency and  memory to become  an  integral part  of the composing and  arranging process motivated by the vital impetus of the musiciansâ€™   creativity.  Thus,   the   musical  bifurcation  point   enabled  by   the ambiguous harmonic resources of the jazz piano  player as well as the introduced altered notes  of the soloist,  makes  all future formal  innovations in jazz possible, including and  especially the  fully  complex and  distributed free  jazz  events  of Ornette Coleman and  those  followers of the Free Jazz Movement since.
