In Renaissance counterpoint, the  composer constructs painstakingly precise juxtapositions  of voices  according to  strict  rules  governing acceptable melodic figures   and   harmonic  textures  involving  acceptable and   forbidden  intervals between notes  and  strict  rules  for  melodic shapes involving contrary (vertical) motion  of  distinct  melodies,  in  terms   of  pitch   intervals.    While   the   rules governing those  textures become  relaxed and  more  sophisticated as  we  move through  Bach,  Beethoven  and   Mahler,   to  Stravinsky,  Ives,  Schoenberg  and Bartok,  in  every  case,  these  compositions are  written with  the  experience of duration-- lived  in a continuous flow during a performance--as frozen,  in suspension, for  the  purposes of  operational control   over  the  behavior of  the musical system represented by the composed score.
