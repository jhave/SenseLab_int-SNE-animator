As a result,  the compositional method involves a tone-row sequence reminiscent of Schoenberg, but with  one crucial  exception. Instead of the fixed pitches of a relativized chromatic half-tone scale, Cage constructs sequential variations upon themes generated out of notes of indeterminate pitch due to the “interference” of competing sound waves  (a term  analogous to “noise” in information theory) created through the random insertion of thumb tacks and rubber bands among the piano  strings. The emphasis for the composer, naturally, becomes  the exploration of contingent percussive and rhythmic expression, and more  to the point,  the exploration of contingent, un-metered duration within the mind of the listener having certain  expectations for orderly musical expression according to long-established rules understood or intuitively internalized through cultural conditioning by that listener.
