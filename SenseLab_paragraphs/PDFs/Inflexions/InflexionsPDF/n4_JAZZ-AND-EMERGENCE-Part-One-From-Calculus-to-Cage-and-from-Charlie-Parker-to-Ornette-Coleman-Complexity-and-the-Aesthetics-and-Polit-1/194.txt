I mention poly-rhythms numerous times  above,  but  here  I wish  to foreground the same  potentialities for bifurcations, leading to layers  of percussive rhythmic abstraction  beneath  and    supporting  the   range    of   performances   by   each instrument during a session  of improvisation.  In fact, one  might  say that  poly- rhythms, occurring in all the world cultures that  have  contributed to the richness of jazz  music,  constitute the  secret  key  to the  nature of the  sonic  landscape of jazz.  For  example, a 2/4  rhythm (meaning two  beats  per  measure with  every quarter note  worth one  beat),  can  be merged contiguously with  a 3/4  rhythm, producing a pulse  of 5/4  or  five  beats  per  measure.   Or,  one  can  play  a 4/4 rhythm at  the  same  time  as  a 3/4  rhythm, producing a cycle  that  comes  into synchrony and  repeats every  12 beats,  which  enables  the soloist  to decide which rhythmic pulse  s/he will embrace, and  which  will be ignored during the solo, or, in a call and response approach, imply  each rhythmic pulse  alternately.
