13   I  would  like  to  express  my  debt   to  William   R.  Paulson,  my  “de   facto” dissertation director at the University of Michigan, for showing the relevance of the work  of  Michel  Serres  to understanding 2nd  and  3rd  order cybernetics. This proved a valuable context  for understanding the  work  of Jacques  Attali.  It did not take long to discover the contribution of Henri  Bergson  and  Ilya Prigogine to Serres’ project.
