9  Conversations with  Dr. Nelson Harrison, Pittsburgh, PA, June  and  July, 2009. Dr.  Harrison, whose  Ph.D.  is in clinical  psychology, is an  alumni of the  Count Basie  Orchestra and   many   other   ensembles  over  the  years,  and   a  nationally recognized jazz educator in Pittsburgh, recently interviewed for the 2009 PBS documentary From Harlem to Montmartre.   This  is a complaint voiced  by many well-known jazz musicians over the years.   I repeat their  arguments here, despite having been a 1970â€™s product of precisely that form of education.
