How  one might  define  Ornette Coleman's theorization of “Free Jazz,” in terms  of a   distributed  form    of   musical   expression   (called    "Harmelodics"),   as   an evolutionary extension of the line of conceptual flight  opened up  by Be-Bop composing practices. Other  artists  also  embraced the  distributed nature of jazz performances, involving the maximum freedom in juxtaposing independent and sometimes contrasting melodic, harmonic and  rhythmic materials, so that  those associated with  John Coltrane (for example McCoy Tyner  and  Pharaoh Sanders), Miles Davis (for example John Scofield, Jack DeJohnette, and  Dave Holland), and the  Art  Ensemble of Chicago  (for  example Roscoe  Mitchell  and  Lester  Bowie), were  enabled to reach for a full realization of performative freedom.
