then  followed by re-composition and then  further improvisationsâ€”what Deleuze and   Guattari  might   call   aural-visual  de-territorializations  and   re- territorializations.  These processes enable  song structures, as the vehicles  for improvisation, as well as the conceptual/linguistic musical content (harmony, melody  and   rhythm) of  those   songs,   to  evolve   into  increasingly  subtle   and abstract forms at breath-taking speed.
