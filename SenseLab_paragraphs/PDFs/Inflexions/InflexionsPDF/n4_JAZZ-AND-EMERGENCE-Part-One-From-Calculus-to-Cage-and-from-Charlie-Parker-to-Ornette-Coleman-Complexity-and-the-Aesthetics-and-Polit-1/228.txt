17   Bergson’s  answer to  the  rigidity of  western  cognition and   the  conceptual systems that  this  rigidity produces, is to postulate “an  original impetus of life”. This impetus, “sustained right  along  the  lines  of evolution among which  it gets divided,  is  the   fundamental  cause   of  variations,  at  least   of  those   that   are regularly passed on,  that  accumulate and  create  new  species”  (1911: 87).   The memory, or instinctual habit  of the  system, when engaged with  the  contingent flow of time through the impetus of its vital force, proceeds to differentiate, and then  to  stabilize that  difference, through  preserving the  memory of difference against contingency. In some way then,  matter is instinct and  memory, energy is creativity and intuition.   Crucial  for Bergson  is the correspondence of this evolutionary process, which  he calls “the  continuity of life” (1911: 27) governing physical  systems  with   the  growth  of  human  thought  and   social  formations towards greater complexity and  diversity. How  we interpret this continuity rises the same problems as those  posed by the overreliance on calculus in physics, and on mechanistic and  finalistic  models in biological evolution: “In vain,  therefore, does  life evolve  before  our  eyes as a continuous creation of unforeseeable form: the  idea  always persists in that  form,  unforeseeability and  continuity are  mere appearance—the outward reflection of our  ignorance.
