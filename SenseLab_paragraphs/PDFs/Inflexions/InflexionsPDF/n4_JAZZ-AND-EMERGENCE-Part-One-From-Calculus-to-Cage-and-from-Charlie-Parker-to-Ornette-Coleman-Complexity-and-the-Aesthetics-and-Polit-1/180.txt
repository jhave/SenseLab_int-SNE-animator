harmonic voicings  in 4ths, and  begin  to use competing triads that  juxtapose non- resolving tonal  centers,  and  thus  become,  through hybridity, ambiguous tonal centers--as exemplified by  the  playing and  compositions of pianist Bill Evans. These ambiguous chordal voicings  in 4ths of McCoy Tyner,  and  upper-structure triads comprised of juxtaposed simple,  yet often  harmonically distant) triads of Bill Evans such as B/A (Lydian), C#/A (Augmented maj 7), or even the very dissonant A/Bb  (diminished), offer  ambiguity at a greater level  of abstraction, bringing jazz, ironically, back seemingly to the modal simplicities of Renaissance counterpoint and  its  textures, only  with  much  more  complex, George  Russell- inspired scales capable of resolving in multiple trajectories, at its basis.
