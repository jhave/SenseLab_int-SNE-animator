and   three-measure  sequences do  indeed  appear  together at  certain   climatic moments.  As a rule,  however, the  white  British  guitarist John  McLaughlin for solos  over  the  complex “Western” chord  sequence, while  the  African-American soprano saxophonist Wayne  Shorter,  implying the  complexity of those  Western chords merely by utilizing to the fullest  the blues  scale resources, solos over  the predominant funky   blues  bass  line.      In  effect,  this  song  thus  straddles the traditions of Western Classical  music  and  the  blues  basis  for African-American classical   music   (with   the   concluding  solo   by   Miles   both   integrating  each approach and,  as  composer and  arranger, making the  implicit  argument as  to which   tradition  is  superior!),   with   the   full   support  of   the   poly-rhythmic techniques of  jazz  drummers  exemplified by  Jack  De  Johnette  on  this  music track, a disciple of Elvin Jones, the pioneering polyrhythmic performer with  John Coltrane.
