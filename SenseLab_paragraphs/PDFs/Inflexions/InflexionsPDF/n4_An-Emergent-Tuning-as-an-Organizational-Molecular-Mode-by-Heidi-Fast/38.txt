order to generate fine movements of transformation in touch  with  these  planes and  substances. I want  to intentionally use  the  term  ”knowledge” or  ”thought material”, to create  a distance with  the idea in which  art is fundamentally (only) a bunch of affects,  (and  not,  say,  a creation of a knowledge). This is something Deleuze and  Guattari discuss in their  book  What  is Philosophy? (1993, 200-201). For them,  a remaining object, that  is a work  of art,  is a bloc of sensation;  which means   a  certain   kind   of  composition  of  perceptions  and   affects  (Ibid.,  168). Deleuze and  Guattari really  say:  a work  of art  is a creature of perception and nothing else,  existing  ipso  facto  (intrinsically). Existing  thus  already before the viewer  or  the   listener,  who   are   thereby  able   to  experience  it  always  only afterwards.  Even   though  there   is  much   beauty  in   Deleuze  and   Guattari’s definition of art, I cannot not resist the dimension in which  art is a collapsing and enveloping  composition,  and   in  which   the   art   happens  already  before   the listener-viewer, and  particularly, in which  the work  of art cannot be affected,  but it must  stay strong.
