The  virtual, ”habitable zone”  deals  also  with  the  proliferation or  breeding of power, of movement.  In relation with  the deep  human ability,  (this condition to both  “good” and  to “bad”), Giorgio  Agamben talks about  power and  potency as something, that  the  human is,  or  what   she  has  that  is  existent.   Meaning “a simple  fact of ones  own  existence  as a potentiality or a power” (1995, 46).  After that  everything seems  to become  complicated for a human being.   And  for this very  same  reason the ethics  are starting to work  (Ibid.).   In power-ethics, (or the ethics  of the  condition to both  compassion and  hostility) – that  is, according to him,  the  only  possible ethical  experience – there  is no  room  for regret.    This  is because Agamben’s  ethics  are  fundamentally linked with  the  potential and  the not  yet actualized, the  not  yet “sprouted”.  The most  beautiful thing  with  what he says, is it’s request to deal with  the jointness of power and  action (of a human) in the  shape of a particular kind  of a halo  or an  aureole.  This  jointness  in the action   is  applying  particularly  to  new  forms   of  subjectivity,  resonances  and feelings  arising and  emerging.  I think  that  the  important thing  still is the  scale through which  Agamben presents the potential generation of new  subjectivities: the new doesn’t mean  that  we need  to establish an entirely new  world, since it is enough just to “move  this cup a bit or that  plant  or this rock, and  thereby all the things” (1995, 53).   The same  minimal scale, a slightly-sized offset, or a transformation,  rules   also   in  the   entwinement  or  interdiffusion  of  art   and philosophy, or, art and  therapeutic action.
