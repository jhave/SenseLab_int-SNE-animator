Even  though I am  not  willing  to  draw a sharp line  between listening to  and looking at,  since  it might  be even  more  appropriate to think  about  that  which sounds and  one can or has to listen,  and  the  sights  one sees or tries to see, more as synesthetical and  constantly crossing currents, my point  with  this essay  takes up a position closer to the scale of listening and  the audible act of attuning.
