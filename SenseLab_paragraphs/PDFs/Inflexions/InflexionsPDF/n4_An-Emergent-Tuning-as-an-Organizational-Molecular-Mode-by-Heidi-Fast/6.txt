With   this   paper  I  cannot  obviously  have   a  satisfying  answer  to  this   wide question,  but  I  hope   that   during the  paper,  I  will  be  able  to  present some elements of a singular aesthetic “method”, which  I call an emergent (or becoming) tuning, which  nevertheless has some proximity with  Virno's  question. This vocal- bodily  method, or practice, is not  an exact method – nor  it is an exact answer – but  proceeds rather as series  of fragile  and  uncertain experimentations, in order to create  some  molecular moments of transsubjectivity, of sharing, and  light, temporal communities (with  no designated common denominator).
