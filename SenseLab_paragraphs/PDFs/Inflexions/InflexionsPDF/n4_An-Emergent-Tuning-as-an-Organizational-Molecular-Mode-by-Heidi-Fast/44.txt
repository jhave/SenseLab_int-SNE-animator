“a breath”. Further, it was  thinking about  a process – a breathing – between a life, that  a human “has”,  (a life that  she belongs to), and  a life, which  is not  her own.  The breath means  a hospitable, gentle  and  tentative practice:  a continuous emanating,  becoming and   change between  virtual  and   actual   “spaces” –  in between the  concrete notations and  the  immanent happenings, that  happened during, and  regardless, of the work:  the moving of the people – listener-viewers, passers-by – the sounds of the square of Theatre Academy of Helsinki, the agora (where the  work   took  place),  the  talking, and   of  course   the  vocal  sang  and videoed material of the work.
