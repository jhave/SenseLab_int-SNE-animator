In the  basis  of my  vocal  thinking there  is an understanding of the  vocal  human voice, (and this is a factor of a human species),  that is fundamentally inter-spaced and   concurrent  with   its  own   interior  and   exterior  places,   because  it  is  co- sounding and  resonating both  of  these  areas  at  the  same  time.  Vocal  voice  – which  doesn’t clearly  belong  to the  realm  of speech  but  emanates as occasional pulsations and  strings of energy – affects and  comes to the listener on an unclear level.  This  level  or  space,  which  activates many  senses,  doesn’t  happen in  the internal and  intimate, or the external space  of the listener, but is an utter  state  of complication  and   confusion.  This  confusion arises  from  the  point   that  voice opens  the perception of the body  – both  the one who  produces it, and  potentially also  the  listener’s  –  by  happening  and   resonating  in  both   of  these   spaces, (internal and  external), at the same  time.  Thus  the human voice is an opening in between different extensions, more  than  a stretch, or, analogously an inner  and private happening of  one  human being.  It composes itself  rather as  a  spatial interval,  or  a  happening, that  always  includes and   evokes   the  multitude,  as Finnish  musicologist Milla  Tiainen  said:  the  assembly of both  the  human and non-human  components.  I  will   now   modulate  a  bit  Ettinger’s   idea   of  an “extimate zone”,  or  “matrixial borderspace”, in  order to  move  it maybe  a bit closer to the “realm” of vocal voice. Within  this “realm”, the extimate zone might no longer  be only a psychic  space,  but also, (in a molecular level), a physical one: with  vocal voices rather extending than  binding dimensions, the voice cranks  the oppositions of different spatial dimensions out  of their  joints,  causes  molecular flicker, and really touches the body: the skin, the flesh, the inner  organs.
