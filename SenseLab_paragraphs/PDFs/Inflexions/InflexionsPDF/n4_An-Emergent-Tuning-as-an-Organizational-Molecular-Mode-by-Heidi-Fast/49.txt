As a conclusion, there  is no thick,  meaningful sentence that  can be given  as an answer to  the  question from  the  beginning – of  an  organizational  base,  that would cradle,  somehow, this  condition of a human to  both  hostile  action  and compassion,  to  action   that   can   cause   both   paralyzing,  or  gentle   molecular (therapeutic) “movement”. I hope,  however, that  during this  paper, there  have been   some   moments  of  flicker   and   attunement  around  this   problem.  The potential   moments   of   molecular   resuscitation   or    gentle    resonation   are nevertheless something that  need  to take place in such events,  that  have at least a slight sense of an immanence – or urgency – within them,  and  then  carry on from those  conditions, from  those  singular, particular zones,  in order to awaken the stiff and  paralyzed parts,  or moments, or memories, in us.
