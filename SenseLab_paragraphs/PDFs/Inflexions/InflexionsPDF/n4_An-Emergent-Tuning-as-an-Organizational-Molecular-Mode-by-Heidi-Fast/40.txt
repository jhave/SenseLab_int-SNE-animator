talks about  as ”the absolute sharing”. This unconditional sharing means  an intermediary knowing  between an  artist  and  a listener-viewer, between me  and not-me, (and  maybe  also between a human and  non-human), that is being passed on by an erotic attuning. This way of knowing is realized by and  within local and constantly renewing structures, (see also Deleuze and  Guattari, 2005, 88).  A non- cognitive  knowledge  as   an   emerging  power  articulated  by   vocal   thought material  is  as  porous,  small   and   brittle   as  a  human  voice,  and   the  crucial condition of it is not to serve any particular (“exterior” or symbolic) end.
