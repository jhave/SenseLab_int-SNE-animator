A musicologist, Gascia  Ouzounian, writes  that  my work  enables  an “actualizing philosophy”.  One  that  is placed in “the  zone  of indistinction” between art and philosophy.   She    argues   that    this    philosophy,   (or    philosophy-in-action), “actualizes virtualities (unrealized potentialities), affecting  transformative shifts through  small    mutations  in   perceptions   and    behaviors  –   displacements specifically centered upon refocusing relationships between bodies  and environments”. (2009, 75)  I have  been  applying the term  “compassionate zone” to  describe the  work  of an emergent tuning  within my  artworking.   There  is a certain   phrase in  astronomy, which   describes a  zone  that  is  favorable to  life around a star  as a “habitable zone,  HZ”.   A non-life,  that  is, not  death, but  “the non-life  as not  yet  emerged, as the  not  yet  becoming alive”,  as Bracha  Ettinger writes  (2005, 709).  The not-yet-emerged life is something that  is still virtual, and not  yet actualized.  For an artist,  the  zone  that  is “habitable”, but  the  zone  of a non-life, may  enable  the  generation, (or  the  sub-breathing), of a certain  unclear “place” with  an artwork. A place  that  opens  up  for the potential germinating of something new  – “molecular” thickness between the  internal and  the  external, between the listener-viewer and  the artist,  small mutations of moments of subjectivity.    This  is  a  new  kind   of  encounter –  an  “encounter-event”, after Ettinger (2006c, 201) – with  the world, that  is in the mode  of happening without being  foreclosing or segregated.  Or it is a place of mutation between the virtual and  the  actual,  as Akseli  Virtanen articulates, the  power-field of becomings and
