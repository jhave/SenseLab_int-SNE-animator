A reciprocal logic, which  drives the  common communication between people is different when it is realized within duration. This kind  of logic, suggests Guattari (2008),   that   doesn’t   only   concern  human  subjects,    but   also   for   example landscapes, ”group subjectivities”  or faces,  is a logic of intensities (2008, 12). An erotically toned “body”, one that derives or causes  affects, is not exactly the body of an individual human being,  but utterly an assemblage. The affect, according to Deleuze and  Guattari, is the “body’s” condition at the moment of it being  under the influence of another body.  This influence is not just transient, but “affects  my duration, my pleasure or pain,  my joy or sorrow”. They argue that in affects, one doesn’t only  transfer from  one  ”state” to another, but  the  human becomes  non- human. (1993, 177) The state of an art-work may also be like this: potentially generous, yielding and drifting.
