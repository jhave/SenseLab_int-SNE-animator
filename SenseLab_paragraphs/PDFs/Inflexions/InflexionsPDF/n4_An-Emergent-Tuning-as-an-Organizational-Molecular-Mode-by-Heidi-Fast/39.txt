When  Agamben talks about  singularity (1995, 63-64), he talks about  a certain “happening  of  the  outside” (Ibid.,  64).  A  happening  that   doesn’t  have   any particular, determinant concept or identity, but  which  is as a door  with  which there  is no other  space (or symbolic reference) behind (Ibid., 63-64). I consider my vocal works  through the structure of singularity in so far that  they  don’t present or represent the world, but try to participate in it, or even generate it. They are not organizations  of   representation  or   authentic  and    total   presence,  but   are problematic fields  that  (always) also  refer  to something unforeseen. So far,  (in their  participation, exposure and  drifting), they  are  also  performative. In vocal performances the  vocal  “elements”, (for  example, in  It’s Voicy   [another vocal work  of mine  from  2007] there  were  assemblages of staccato-like vocal  voices, long  and  even  vocal  voices,  all without any  words, and  more  freely  dispersive sounds of an electric bass), in relation with  other  (living  and  non-living) material within the  piece,  can  be  some   kinds   of  joint  and   non-cognitive ”concepts”.
”Knowledge” doesn’t organize itself as an artistic  knowledge (of an artist),  or as an absolute knowing (in or with  art),  but  a bit like that  what  Ettinger (2008,16)
