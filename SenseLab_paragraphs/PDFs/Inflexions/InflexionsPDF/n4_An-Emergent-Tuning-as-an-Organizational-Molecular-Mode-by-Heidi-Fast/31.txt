The name,  Amorous Dialogues referred to a logic of an encounter-event, (see also Ettinger 2006c, 201), that  is the  logic  of currents and  change. Even  though the open  concert  in the apartment was  not singing together, (in a sense  that  I would have  invited people to  sing  with  me,  as  I did  on  the  second day  of Amorous Dialogues, in the Song of the Dwellings), the  condition for listening did  try  to be something  else  than   simply  passive. Amorous  Dialogues referred  to  a  certain power and  energy, (of which  Luce Irigaray writes  about),  that as a sap of musical rhythms and  tones,  arises  at us  from  below,  in order to create  transformation. This  power, says  Irigaray, (which  is not  mentally [or physically] paralyzing as some   other   powers  might   be),  is  the   power  of  listening  and   receiving.  A receiving, or acceptance, that  isn’t just passive, and  doesn’t just belong  to the ear, but  in which  the  whole  body,  breathing and  soul should participate. (2004, 134-
135).
