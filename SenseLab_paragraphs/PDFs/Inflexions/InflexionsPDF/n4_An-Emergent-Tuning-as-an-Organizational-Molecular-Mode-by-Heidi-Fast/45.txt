It’s Voicy was  a kind  of a trans-subjective  process, in which  the  horizontal line didn’t  signify   the  event   of  transgressing  and   abandoning none,   a  human, an individual, my  own  life, (or  the  life of others),  but  “letting go”  and  unfolding among these  all. “Haecceitas” is a word Deleuze (2005, 81) gives to these  kinds  of small  and  inseparable passages, as  he  describes this  non-personal singularity: “We [Deleuze and  Guattari] are not certain  that  we are persons at all: a breath of air, a wind, a day  and  night,  [---], a place,  a fight  or an illness  each  has  a non- personal singularity” (Ibid.)
