about   restoration, but  about   generating new  passages and   trajectories; about pulses and  rhythms.  Even  though the  context  of this  work  belongs roughly to the area of art, or the area  of vocal art, those  processes and  events  of a molecular anabiosis of humanity, (that  are the basis  of my work),  are not meant to be only metaphorical.  This work  – the  so called  “artworking,” after  Ettinger (see 1999,
124), or, as Brian Massumi and  Erin Manning have  termed “research-creation” – also   considers  a   few   areas   of   knowledge  other   than   art.   Areas   such   as philosophy, and  perhaps also some forms of therapeutic healing, or, “the work  of healing.”  The level, or “plane”, of artworking differs  however from  the abstract concepts of philosophy, or, for example, the clinical work  in medicine.
