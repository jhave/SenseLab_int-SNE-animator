The  breathing voice,  the  breath of  an  ear,  and  of  the  listening and  accepting body,  the  space(s)  as breathing elements, calls for the  artist,  (the  one  producing the  voice  – either  on  an  actual,  immanent event,  or  through different kinds  of media), and  the  listener-viewer, (as  well  as other  living  material), to  a certain constant and  emergent state  of tuning. I will give you an idea of a work  of mine, called  Amorous  Dialogues, practicing acoustic ranges, that  happened in  2006, in order to illustrate some molecular ways of resistance through ”emergent tuning”. This was  a piece,  co-commissioned by ANTI-Festival, an annual festival  of site- specific works  held in the Finnish  city of Kuopio,  and a local real estate  company, which   provided  me   with   the   use   of  a  temporarily  vacant   three-bedroom apartment in  a multi-storey building in  Kuopio.  Amorous  Dialogues took  place over  the  course  of two  days,  of which  on  the  first  day,  there  was  a three  hour long  ”open concert” happening within this  apartment. (Open  at least  in a sense that the audience could  enter  and  leave at will.) For the open  concert  I assembled a small multitude of materials inside  the apartment: five small loudspeakers that I installed in different rooms,  a synthesizer/sampler  that  I used  to control  the playback of pre-recorded vocal sang  (without any  words) materials, (along  with both   a  composition-notation  and   with   the   movements  and   rhythms  of  the listener-viewers), two  videos  that  I projected from  television screen  in different rooms,  a blanket with  a poem  I had  sewn  into  it,  and  a poster, with  a poem within it, that I mounted inside  an adjacent elevator.
