For  example, through  the   traces   of  moments  of  physical  and   mental paralyses, the small  stiff moments that  we might  feel and  sense,  but  not be able to show,  or know,  exactly where they  come from.   How  can we try to articulate – or  rather  resuscitate and   resonate –  those  stiff  and  immobile “parts”  (of  the trauma) in us and in others?
