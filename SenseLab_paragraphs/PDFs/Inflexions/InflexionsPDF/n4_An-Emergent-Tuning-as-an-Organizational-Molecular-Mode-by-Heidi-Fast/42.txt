An  emergent composition is  not  a  certain   form  or  genre  of  art,  but  a  living system, an event,  organized by certain,  “breathing”, logic, referred to earlier  in this  paper. This  logic  might   be  some  kind  of  a  composition of  an autopoietic machine, like  that  of Humberto Maturana and  Fransesco Varela,  and  of “a co- poietic” (as  Ettinger  2006c,  201  continues),  non   self-sufficient  mode   of  co- operation and  co-production. This kind  of   “a copoiesis involves conductive shareability, which  might  lead to traumatizing as well as to healing” (Ibid.). This is a logic that  doesn’t so much  – at least not only – need  the actual  compositional notations, plans,  structures and  tones  mediated by  the  composer, or  the  artist, but a certain  way of being wide open in the immanent event-moment of the composition. This means  widening up  the metabolism of the work  also towards the external elements of it, (as described before).  It might  be described by using Felix  Guattari’s  term  “the  logic  of intensities”, or,  “an  ecosophic logic”:  in  an emergent state,  (or  register), this  composition resonates each  immanent event- moment, trying to inhabit the human existence  of that moment.
