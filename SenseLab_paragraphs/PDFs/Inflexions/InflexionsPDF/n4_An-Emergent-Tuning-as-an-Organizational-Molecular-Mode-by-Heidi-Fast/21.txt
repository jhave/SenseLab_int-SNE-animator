Artworking in a world, in which  it is not possible to split any more  between that what  is mute,  and  that  which  can be communicated, calls for practices that  are not restricted purely (and  only)  to artistic  or aesthetic fields.  The central  point  is not  this   or  that   private  process, or  a  certain   disciplinary  capacity  to  solve problems, but  the  generation of manifold junctions  of co-resistance, solidarity and   joint  responsibility.  This  kind   of  a  delicate  and   “breathing”  resistor  is completed in the virtual (the  non-life)  sector,  and  is affecting  above  all our  own future. Alain  Badiou  uses  the  term  “infinite thought” for  this  kind  of zone  of indistinction (2005, 32). A thinking that  doesn’t close to any  specific  function or aim, but  a thinking – or thinking-in-action – that  envelopes inside  itself the  fine and  discrete pulse  of modulation.
