that Bracha Ettinger (see 2006a and  2006b, 85), has named through her psychoanalytical and  artistic  work.   This condition to be both  is positioned at the very  heart  of a deep  human ability.  The different appearances of friendship and sharing, and  as well the molar  imbalance, or the “paralyzings of becoming”, have concerned also  other  contemporary thinkers, philosophers and  artists  such  as Felix  Guattari,  Giorgio   Agamben,  Franco   Berardi,   Brian  Massumi  and   Erin Manning.  To   begin   now   with   the   affects   that   the   unstable  and   violent fluctuations of this ability  causes  in the bodies  it touches or penetrates into, I will pause in Adriana Cavareros’ project,  with  which  she tries  to unmask the lack of coherence being  built on the terms  of the spreading contemporary violence,  now being   called   (in  its  extensive forms)  as  “terrorism”, “war” or  “humanitarian war”.  To speak  primarily of the of crime of violence,  rather than  of the strategies and  politics  of it, she introduces the  word horrorism – “as though ideally  all the innocent victims,  instead of their  killers,  ought to determine the name.” (2009, 3). By horrorism, she  refers  to  the  physical affects  of violence  – the  bristling, hair- raising sensation of an “instinctive disgust”, in which  the  body  is disabled in a state of a total paralysis, a bit like the physical feeling  of gooseflesh and  growing stiff when freezing.  Terror, or panic  terror and  panic  fear,  refers  also to “not  a psychological  dimension  but   a  physical  state”   of  fear,   and   is,  as  Cavarero articulates, an  instinctive movement of  an  individual, in  order to  flee  from  a violent  death (Ibid, 4, 7–8) – or as for example Franco Berardi  (2006, 134–138), has talked about,  from the acceleration of the infosphere that  is too much  for us, and opens  our  minds up  into  a chaotic  state  of panic.   However, the  collective  and contagious forms   of  panic   seem  to  bring   the  fear,  as  a  physical state,  to  its fulfillment: according to Cavarero (2009, 6), it seems  to  turn  the  very  violence that  forces the body  to flee, into a killing  machine, (or other  kinds  of devastating, but non-fatal acts of violence  as well), against one another.
