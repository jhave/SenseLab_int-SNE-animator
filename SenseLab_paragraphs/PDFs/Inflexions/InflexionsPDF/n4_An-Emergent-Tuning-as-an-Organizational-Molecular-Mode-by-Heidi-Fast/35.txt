In  an  ethical  sense,  this  kind  of an  open-ness in  a listener-viewer calls  for  an arrival to a certain  level of fragility. The fact that  vocal voice is actually touching, even  penetrating, by it’s quality, calls for a particularly sensitive, hospitable and tentative kind   of  practice from  an  artist.   An  aesthetical-ethical practice, or  a method, that  “breathes” at the  extimate zones  of the  artist  and  listener-viewer, the work  and  the  Other  life. And  while  it is possible, but  not obligatory, for the listener-viewer to open  herself  to this  certain  frequency, this  fragile  state  of an active  acceptance, it is not  a truism. In  a hospitable, compassionate art-event, where the  artist  keeps  a certain  spatial distance, remaining a tone  of proximity, the  listener-viewer has  always the  possibility to react  critically  and  not  let the potential, or, the molecular flicker of the voice affect on her.
