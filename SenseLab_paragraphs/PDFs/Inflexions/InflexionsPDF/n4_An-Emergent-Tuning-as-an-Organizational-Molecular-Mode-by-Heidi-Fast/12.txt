Spinoza suggests that  we  can  choose  the  idea  of those  “bodies” that  bring  us delight (Deleuze, 2006, 219). The challenge seems  simple,  although as Cavarero highlighted, it actually is not – at least not for everybody.  What  are the ways  for art to participate or generate a production of the  solidarity, the  gentle  power or potency in human life?   I am talking about  small, molecular vibrations and resonations of power, (not hunting for a powerplant).  With an extension: under what  kinds  of conditions, or,  the  mutations of which  kinds  of processes can  a human generate her own  life?  This generation or creation would be rather more like   the   process  of   the   sprouting  and   germination  of   a   plant,    than   the extravagance of the divine creation of the world. This kind  of a “creation” is also an  act of resistance.   It  is  resistant  in  the  way  in  which   the  direction of  the resistance  has   transformed  from   one   more   restrained  to  a  more   yielding, expressive and productive one.
