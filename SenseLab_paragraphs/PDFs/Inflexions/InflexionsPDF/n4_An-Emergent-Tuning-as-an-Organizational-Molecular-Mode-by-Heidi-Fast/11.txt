As  Felix  Guattari  has  also  stated, through  a  different  frame,   the  ecological catastrophe that  we  are  facing  at the  moment doesnâ€™t concern only  the  state  of nature, but is thoroughly human - her body  and  soul.  Guattari worries about  the loss  of, not  only  the  species,  but  the  words and  gestures of our  understanding and  solidarity, which  we are about  to lose (2008, 12).
