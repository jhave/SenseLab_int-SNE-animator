A kind  of hypnotic effect kicks  in after  two  hours or so. The more  I watch,  the more  the shreds of fictional,  historical, and  “real”  time  seem  to dance  before  my senses.  For  The Clock does  not  simply give  you  one  scene  after  the  other;  this archive  remixes  cinema  through all kinds  of continuity editing, from matches-on- action  to  sound overlaps, thereby mixing  all senses  of time.  Claudette Colbert flirts  with  Patrick  Swayze,  at 11:27, which  is now. Juliette  Binoche  is neighbors with   Doris  Day.  Cary   Grant   calls  Daryl   Hannah. The  editing  techniques  of filmmaking have  rarely  been so conspicuously flaunted and,  yet, so enjoyable, so magical.  What  comes into sensation in excess of The Clock’s measured, linear chronology is time felt as a nonlinear folding. The sensation of magic arises  from the way  in which  contingent shots  are joined  together to create  a heterogeneous but  functional whole.  For it works.  It makes  sense  – if sense  is not  reduced to meaning.  Marclay’s   piece   backgrounds  signification, for  instance  in  that   it doesn’t  care  to  tell  a coherent story,  for  the  sake  of expression as  the  creative dimension of sense. The Clock does not so much  highlight the fact that  “cinematic time”  consists  of contingent images  and  shots  as it instills  an appreciation for the wondrous ways  in  which  film  creates coherent times  and  spaces  through the contiguity of  discontinuous  elements.
