One  might   discard  these   considerations  by  objecting   that   the  archive   quite simply cheats.  But that would be to accept chronometrics as the only rule of time. Or one  might  argue  that  my  fragmentary experience of The Clock (due  to daydreaming, sleep,  and  metabolism) is less  than  the  actual  artwork. But  that would  be  to  turn   The  Clock into  an  autonomous  art  object  when it  clearly foregrounds its relational qualities. It would be to ignore  that  all of these  aspects feed into  the experience in excess of the archiveâ€™s  mere  unfolding on the screen. The archive  comes  to life as it is attentively experienced, drowsed through, remembered, forgotten, ignored and  reported. In other  words, it is by virtue of their  lacks and  lags that  the felt times  of The Clock are more  than  just an archive in real-time. This felt moreness of time,  this excess over  Chronos, coincides with an emergent environment relationally co-created by the flickering playful screen, the  mesmerized human spectators (and  their  company if applicable) as well  as the few uncomfortable couches  of an improvised movie-theater-living-room in a museum.
