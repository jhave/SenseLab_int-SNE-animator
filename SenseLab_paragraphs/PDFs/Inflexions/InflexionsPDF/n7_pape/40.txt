[9] Interestingly, this remix of times and media also manifests itself thematically in many  landmarks of CGI filmmaking: Jurassic Park (Stephen Spielberg, 1993) dives into   the   deep   past   of  the   Earth   and   shows   a  strong  interest  in   reading (dinosaur’s)  footprints,   the   stock   example   of   indexicality.   Avatar   (James Cameron, 2009),  a  showcase at  the  time  of  what   digital media  can  do,  also purports a profound distrust of human technology and  a longing for a re- enchanted, animistic mode  of being  in the world. With  a focus  on cinema  itself, Martin  Scorsese’s   3D-spectacle  Hugo  (2011)  returns  to  film’s   beginnings  in homage to Georges  Méliès.
