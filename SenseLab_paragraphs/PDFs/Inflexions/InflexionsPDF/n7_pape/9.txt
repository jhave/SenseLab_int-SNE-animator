Tippi  Hedren talk  to  Christian Bale,  he  insists   that  an  edited moving-image narrative is a fundamentally nonlinear process  that  invents spacetimes as it folds one shot into another. (Every amateur filmmaker understands this creative aspect of making cinematic spacetime: get  the  180° rule  wrong and  space  falls  apart, time  seems  to fragment.) The notion of the fold is central  because it emphasizes that  the  co-creation of space  and  time  happens at the  cut,  through the  cut.  The sensed spacetime of a film scene comes  into existence  as the sequence folds  past and  future spaces  into  one  another at  the  cut.  Only  when a shot  becomes  the past,  its  content can  be  located  “over  there” or  “right here”  in  relation to  the outfolding shot.  In any  case, spatial orientation is only  in time.  In this  way,  The Clock enables an  intuitive understanding  of  the  disparity between “cinematic time,”  in which  contingent instants/images succeed each other  indifferently, and the   sensations   of   spacetime  that    cinema    continuously   invents.   Cinematic spacetime is a topological fold. [3]
