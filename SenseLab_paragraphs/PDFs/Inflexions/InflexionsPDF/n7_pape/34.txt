[3]  If  one  wanted to  create   some  (productive)  terminological  confusion, one could  say that  Marclay’s technique consists  of “false continuities” (faux raccords). The term  conventionally refers  to seeming incoherencies in editing, discontinuities in montage between images  that  seem  to belong  together. What  Marclay  does  is the  exact  opposite: His  editing creates  an  apparent (false)  continuity between images  that  do not belong  together. Based on my argument in the text, however, conventional  faux raccords  and   Marclay’s   false   continuities  have   the   same function:  From   false   continuity,  “there  results  an   effect   of   hiatus  which underlines the  disjunctive  nature of  change of  shot,  which  elaboration of  the rules of montage had  always concealed” (Burch cited in Deleuze 1989: 326, n. 47). This is not to say that  disjunction is destructive. To the contrary, false continuity underlines that  continuity and  discontinuity cannot  be separated out  from  one another.  (It  should be  mentioned  that   the  quoted note  from  the  Time-Image wrongly translates “faux  raccord” as “film  continuity,” which  may  add  another level of confusion.)
