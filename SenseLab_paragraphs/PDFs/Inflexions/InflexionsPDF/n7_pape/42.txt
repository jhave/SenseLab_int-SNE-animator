[11] William  Connolly’s film-inspired micropolitics resonates with  this  when he says that,  over time, the “objective  institutions that  preexist us become  infused to variable degrees into  dispositions, perceptions, beliefs,  and  resistances we share and   contest   with   others” (2002: 20).  Micropolitical investment  is  a  matter of experimentation  by  means   of  “relational  techniques  of  the  self,”  which   are “mixtures” of perceptual, intellectual and  semiotic  practices. In resonance with my  overall   argument on  The Clock, Connolly holds   that  “[i]nteresting things might  happen if you place film technique into contact  with  your  own  perceptual experience” and rethink your  ethics and politics  from there  (16).
