[7] These considerations arise  in part  from  a struggle with  my own  background, which  is partly in  traditional and  so-called  “post-classical narratology,”  which tacitly  assumes that  film  narrates in the  present. While  many  narrative studies now  distance themselves from  their  structuralist roots,  this  assumption and  the underlying question of film’s tense  of narration still originate in the  inadequate comparison of  film  to  literature, i.e.  language. This  question leads  to  a  false problem insofar   as,  on  the  one  hand, the  determination of  narrative tense  in language is  largely   a  matter of  morphology and,  on  the  other  hand, moving images  lack a comparable morphological marker of tense.  The “solution” to this false problem oftentimes consists  in concluding that  the temporal unmarkedness of moving images  must  mean  they  narrate in the  present. This  is a semiological answer, which  considers form  and  codified sense,  when what   is  needed is  a semiotic approach with  a focus on form-taking and  making sense  (Deleuze 1989:
25-43). In a way, then,  the present paper is an attempt to avoid  this false problem and consider the temporality of cinema  from a different – experiential – angle.
