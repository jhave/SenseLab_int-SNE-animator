For, after  trance,  there’s  fatigue. After  deliriously dancing with  the  archive  for five hours, I fall out of step.  I trail off along  the slowing rhythm of my own  time as the The Clock stubbornly follows  the staccato  of the clock. Memories from  the twilight zone  between sleep  and  waking include phones. Romantic late-night calls and  worried callers  reporting a relative missing. Frantic  calls from  the 30s, passionately answered in the 80s, half-witnessed in the now. [4] More heard than seen  as my  eyes  drift  shut.  If The Clock is an  archive, then  it is one  that  knows you’re  going  to leave or fall asleep.  As it slowly  exhausts my energy and  waking capacity, Marclay’s piece prepares its own  disarticulation. The somnolent viewer inevitably  fragments  the  archive   in  experience.  “Archive  fever”   is  certainly involved, both on Marclay’s part  and  mine. But the archive’s  unremitting force of reinscription is bound to outrun the most  avid  cinephile. I cannot  help  but  miss large parts  of The Clock during sleep, food and  toilet breaks.  The piece is as much about   remembering and  actualizing film  history as  it  is  about   letting  go  and forgetting. It can be said then  that  Marclay  has ‘completed’ the archive  insofar  as he  has  actually  filled  the  1,440  minutes  of  the  day   with   thousands of  film snippets. [5] However, for physiological and  cognitive reasons, the  viewer can’t possibly sift  through, let  alone  remember all  the  available data.  What  Jacques Derrida calls  archi-violence consists  partly in  this  imbalance between the overwhelming mass  of information and  the  viewer’s  limited energies, waking time, and attention span  (Derrida 1996).
