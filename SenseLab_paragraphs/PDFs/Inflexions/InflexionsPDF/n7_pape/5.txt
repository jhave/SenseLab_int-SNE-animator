I’m bodying myself  through The Clock, probably the most  ambitious project  that the  remix  artist  Christian Marclay  has  developed to this  day.  The Clock is a 24- hour  film  that  shows,  at each  minute of the  day,  scenes  from  film  history that contain a timepiece indicating that  very time of day. At 10:22 PM, The Clock gives you  five or six scenes  of couples going  to bed  at 10:22 PM. I wake  up  at 7 AM because a plethora of alarm  clocks set to 7 AM go off in The Clock. And  because 7 is a good  time for me. 6 AM is not “my hour.”
