eventually, The Clock’s proposition is much  less about  the  crafting of coinciding temporalities than  the experience of time this synchronicity enables. It is, as I shall explain, an experience of the differential between “real time”  and really-felt time. This differential is not  immediately activated. Not  for a few hours. Cinema has disciplined my  body  to  sustain an  adequate level  of attention for  at  least  two hours. I don’t  fall  asleep,  I don’t  get  hungry, no  need  to  use  the  washroom. Discipline  has   separated  my   body   out   from   the   experience  of  watching  a movie.  [1]  So  I  step   in  time   with   The  Clock for  a  while.   Scene  after   scene, Marclay’s  piece  makes  its way  around the  clockface.  Movie  snippets unfold in precise  and  orderly fashion,  at the  same  time  repeating the  portrayed moment, actualizing the  quoted film,  and  re-inscribing the  ruthless logic  of the chronometer. It  is  a  marvelous  collection   of  stand-alone  miniatures  of  timed moments, each  lighting up  film  history in  a flash,  each  straightjacketed  to  the circular grid of the clockface. The Clock is an archive  of times folding into times.
