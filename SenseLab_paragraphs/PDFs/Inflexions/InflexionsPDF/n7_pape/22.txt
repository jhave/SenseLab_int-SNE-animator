If, as  I argue,  The Clock brings  this  understanding of the  present as  a node  of temporal  relations into  felt  awareness,  it  does   so  on  at  least  three   different accounts. Let me briefly  sum  up  the first two  that  have  already been  addressed: first, the piece itself remixes  clock-time, story time, historic  time, etc. Second, as it successfully invites  a sustained engagement of the viewer, it creates  a heightened awareness of oneâ€™s  own  viewing habits,  attention span,  circadian rhythm, etc.
