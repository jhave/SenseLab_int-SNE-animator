The relational coming-together of these  elements makes  it possible to grasp The Clock not merely as an archive  but  as what  Gilles Deleuze calls a diagram. [6] A diagram is  “a  topological transformation  of  an  existing   social  field,  engaging both  with  possibility and  also  with  virtual potential, a reserve of newness and difference” (Thain  2010: 53).

In the case of The Clock (and  in the mainly durational  terms    used    here),   these   components  appear  as   a   plurality  of qualitatively  differing  temporalities,  including  history,  story   time,   cinematic time, viewing time, metric  time, the circadian rhythm, and retrospection, to name only  those  evoked earlier.
