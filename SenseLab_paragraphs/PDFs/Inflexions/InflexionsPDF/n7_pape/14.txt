This  is not  to  turn  The Clock into  an  unattainable, monumental art  object.  The point  is not to say that  the slept-through parts  of the archive  remain dead to me. On the contrary, I am interested in how  the archive  comes to life, how  it acts as a force in the  world. It partly comes  to life in retrospective conversation. Visitors who  have  sat  through the  night  hours tell  me  that,  in  fact,  the  archive  is not complete in the  above-mentioned sense.  At around three  3 AM, I’m told,  clock hands wildly whirl  around their  dials.  Timepieces break  or go mad.  Apparently, someone  speculates,  Marclay   has  run   out   of  material  for  that   time   of  day. Nothing much  seems  to be happening in the  in-between hours of the  morning, not even  in cinema.  Resistance to the archi-violent principle of the chronometer. And,  of course, I’ve slept  through it. Because my experience is incomplete, I must settle  for  hearsay about   The Clock’s very  own  incompleteness. The  archive   is determined  to  make   you   lose  bits  of  it  but,   through  that   very   gesture,  it integrates  the  unseen-unheard  as  a  collective   experience  of  storytelling.  As viewers  actively   participate  in  reconstructing  the   archive   for   one   another, narrative retrospection is added as another layer  of the  temporal experience of The Clock.
