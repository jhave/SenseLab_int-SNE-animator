to  me  that  The Clock draws on  this  temporal economy and its  effects  when it meticulously fills the  minutes of the  day  to  lure  its  viewer’s  into  a trance-like state.  To this,  we can add  the  fact that  the  audience of The Clock, at least  at the National Gallery  in Ottawa, is not  installed in cinema  seats  but  on couches,  the TV set’s  counterpoint par excellence in the  classic  setting  of the  living  room.  In many  ways,  then, the viewing experience that The Clock creates  is just as indebted to  television’s media ecology  as  to  that  of the  movie  theater. I shall  say  more about   the  interesting  challenge that  such  a  movie-theater-living-room hybrid poses  to the institution of the museum. For now,  I would like to address another strong resonance between The Clock and  television, which  consists  in their  shared capacity to lull the viewer into sleep.
