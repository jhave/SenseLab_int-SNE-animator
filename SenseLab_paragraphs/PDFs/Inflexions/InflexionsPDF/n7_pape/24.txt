We have  seen  that,  as The Clock diagrams time  into  existence,  it stays  within the regular beat of the clock and  at the same time goes beyond it. If this is a paradox, then   it  is  for  all  intents  and   purposes  a  productive  one.   Simply   put,   the proposition  is  that   The  Clock  affirms   the   co-existence  (and   co-creativity)  of multiple durations. It also  means  that  what  churns above  and  below  The Clock’s metric  archival practice is  the  anarchive. In  the  anarchive, information is  not stacked away  in orderly, chronological succession. Rather,  the anarchive must  be thought as the ongoing activity  of eventfully reactivating incommensurable pasts for  the  creation of novelty in  the  present, as  the  present. The  anarchive is an ongoing remix  of heterogeneous temporalities. In the  case  of The Clock, this  is easily  recognizable as  an  editorial practice of sampling and  remixing: while  it respects the steady measure of metric  time, The Clock disobeys all other  temporal orders. Thain  states  that  “Marclay’s  work  functions both  as display of archive that  plays  off of the  pleasures of recognition, while  simultaneously making felt the emergence of newness, as the clips generate an audio-visual entity  of the installation in  fluctuating tension with  the  discrete clips”  (Thain  2010: 66). In other  words, the dynamic anarchive simultaneously “doubles and  disrupts” the stable  archive   as  it  reactivates the  stacked-away past  (ibid.).  But  if, as  I have suggested with  reference to Murphie, time  is always a matter of pasts  creatively enfolding and  out-folding a present, then  even  the regular beat  of our  everyday life, including the steady cycles of the institution, is subtended by an anarchival chaos of remixing times.
