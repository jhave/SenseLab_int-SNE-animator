attention  declared  by   the   museum  betrays  its   interest  in   conserving  its institutional form.  The reservation towards carefully implicating cinematic artworks is  also  the  museum’s  resistance to  the  shifts  within its  own  media ecology,  resistance to respond to change, that  is, to time.  In return, the  visitor- viewer’s  discomfort with  such self-declared stability in the face of change betrays the  intuition that  even  institutional environments are  meta-stable at  best. [11] And  meta-stable environments, or  ecologies,  come  with  requirements for  their sustainability,   immanent    criteria    that    change   as    soon    as    the    ecology’s configuration changes. The Clock calls for such  adjustments  in a media ecology that  henceforth spans across  the  walls  of the  museum into  numerous other  art forms   and   institutions.  Conversely, to  understand the  museum as  a  neutral mediator of art  or knowledge is to disregard its immediate involvement in the eventful production of art and knowledge.
