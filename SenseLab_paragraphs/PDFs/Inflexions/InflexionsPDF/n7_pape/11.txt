‘cinema   proper.’  Marclay’s   timepiece,  though   most   often   described  as   a revisitation  of  film  history,  grants  an   interesting,  if  not   peculiar  place   to television. It is true  that,  as a resource for the archival remix,  television occupies a marginal place.  Few  television programs make  it into  the  mix;  the  ones  that come to mind are Emergency Room and  Extras. Significantly, though, television is one  of  The  Clock’s  most   recurrent  bit  players.  The  importance  of  the  small screen’s  small  part  comes  into  focus  when we  consider that  television figures most  prominently within  the  shots,  as  when  Dustin Hoffman watches TV  in Tootsie or Juliette  Binoche  irons  her  laundry in front  of the  small  screen  in Code inconnu.  What  The Clock refers  to in these  and  many  other  clips  is nothing less than  television’s very own temporal economy. In fact, it is perhaps the concept  of televisual time that  can help us grasp The Clock’s strange hypnotic effect. For, not unlike Marclay’s  24-hour  film,  traditional broadcast television used  to  obey  a strict   timetable  (of  airing   slots)   to   such   a  degree  that   “televisual  time   is programmed and scheduled […] down to the last second” (Doane  1990: 237). Yet, and  because of  these  strict  temporal conditions, broadcast TV folds  programs, commercial breaks,  and  trailers into that  infamous “flow”  by which  television is said  to anaesthetize and  immobilize the masses  (Williams  2003: 77-120).
