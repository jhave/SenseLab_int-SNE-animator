The Clock invites  us to acknowledge the  immediacy of relational form-taking as an  experience of really-felt time  in the making: “Immediacy is the  realization of the  potentialities of the  past,  and  is the  storehouse of the  potentialities of the future” (Whitehead 1968, 99-100). In a time  where the  idea  of the  future instills mostly   bleak   visions   of  doom [12],  such   a  concept   of  time,   based   on   our participatory implication in the creative becoming of a singular present, can open towards an  ethos   of  experimentation. “Interesting things  might   happen,”  as William   Connolly says [13],  if  we  ready ourselves to  anarchivally diagram a world into  existence.   To  remix  time  – with  clocks,  in  excess  over  them,   and inspired by The Clock.
