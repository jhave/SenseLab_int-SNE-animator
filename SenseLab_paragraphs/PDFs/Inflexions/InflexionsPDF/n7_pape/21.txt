It is not quite  right  to say that  the cinematographic image  is in the present. What  is in the  present is what  the  image  ‘represents’, but not  the image  itself, which  in cinema  as in painting, is never  to be confused with  what  it represents. The image  itself is the system  of the relationships between its elements, that  is, a set of relationships of time  from   which   the  variable  present  only   flows.   […]  What   is specific to the image,  as soon as it is creative, is to make perceptible, to make visible, relationships of time which  cannot  be seen  in the represented object  and  do  not  allow  themselves to  be reduced to the present. (Deleuze 1989: xi-xii, my emphasis)
