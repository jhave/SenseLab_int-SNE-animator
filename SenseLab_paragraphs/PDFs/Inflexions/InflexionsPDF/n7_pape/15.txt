As  if  this  incompleteness weren’t   enough, cinema   doubly resists   The Clock’s archival principle based  on metric  time.  On the one hand, as I have  just pointed out,  the  archive  must  remain incomplete because certain  times  of day  do  not seem to be significant enough to have  been recorded often  enough. On the other hand, there  are moments in the day that  are so important for film that  they flood the  archive’s  neat  chronological units.  I am  sure,  for  instance, that  12:00 AM lasted   longer   than   sixty  seconds. The  blast  of  fairy-tale departures,  witching hours, ultimatum deadlines and  New  Year’s celebrations lasted  for what  felt like a good  three  minutes at least. Midnight – or the way in which  cinema  imagines it
– overspills the  measures of the  ticking  archive.  What  this  means  is that  really- felt time  exceeds  Chronos, that  is, the  purely quantitative divisions of so-called real-time. In  experience,  time  is  elastic,  made   up  of  a  confluence of  various speeds  and    slownesses.  What    coalesces    around  midnight  is   a   series   of beginnings, endings,  thresholds  and   crises   folding  into   an  intensity  that   is irreducible to the homogeneous extension of the ticking  clock. I remember seeing an exploding bell tower at one point  during my thirteen hours at The Clock. This
