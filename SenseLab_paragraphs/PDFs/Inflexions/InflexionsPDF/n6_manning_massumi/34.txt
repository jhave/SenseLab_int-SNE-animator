Pre-operation, a  preacceleration agitating  in  potentia. Pre-operation, how  the many  become  one (Whitehead). “Perceptual landing sites occur always in sets – a flock  of  birds   flying   in  formation.”  (Arakawa  and   Gins  2002:  10).  To  land perceptually is to field-with in agitation, it is to become-body in a pre-operation that subtracts for a tending that apportions out. Organisms-that-person agitate in the  mix,  but   always  in  a  withness  of  environment:  a  becoming  ecology   of practices.
