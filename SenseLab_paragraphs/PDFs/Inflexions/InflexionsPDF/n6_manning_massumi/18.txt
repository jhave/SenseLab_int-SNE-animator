“Landing sites abound within landing sites” (2002: 9). The architectural surround is a criss-cross field  of many  streams. A field  of nested abundance. It is not  to begin  with  a form.  It is not yet to begin  with  a figure-background configuration. A populated field of alterant-altering interfusion. Agencies-patiencies abounding for the apportioning. For anything in particular to happen, a particular expanse must  be taken.  “The taking  of a particular expanse to be a landing site happens in a flash”  (9). Having been taken to be, the landing site now is. To be is to be had  in a flash.
