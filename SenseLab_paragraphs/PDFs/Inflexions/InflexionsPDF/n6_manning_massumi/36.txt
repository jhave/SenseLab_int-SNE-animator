Thisness:  a flocking.  A quality of experience that  folds  the  many  in the  one,  an interfusing of agency  and  patience, indissolubly alterant-altering. “A tentative constructing toward a holding in place”  not of the one, but  of the polyphony of potential: Do not  presume to know  concretely where the person who  makes architectural-body  sense   lies  (Arakawa  and   Gins   2002,  23).  She  lies  in  her potential. A flocking  toward concrescence, the many  in the one.
