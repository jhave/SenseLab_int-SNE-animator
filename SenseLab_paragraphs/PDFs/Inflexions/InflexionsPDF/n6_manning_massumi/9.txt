Perhaps it is simply too early to make a concrete  distinction between alterant and altered, affecting  and  affected-by. For the underlying activity  is a push that pulls. The  body  is pushed into  a taking-account already in  process,  and  this  pulls  it toward a  self-individualizing  realization. Not  yet  one  or  the  other,   agent   or patient,  the   body   is  finding  itself  in  an  undisentangleable  “interlocking  of modes”  (Whitehead  1967:  70).   Bare   activity.    Every   site   is   a   prehensive interlocking of reciprocal modes in bare  activity.  There  is no  “simple location” (69-71). The smile  spreads over  the face, as the face fits itself onto  the smile  (71). The couch  fits itself to the body,  as the body  spreads itself over the couch. The fit is already apportioning this  double potential the  instant the  couch  is perceived, even   at   an   uncomfortable  distance.  In   the   underlying  activity    of   every perception, there  is one two-way movement of reciprocal interfusion already incipiently, actively  taking  account. “Our  body  penetrates the sofas on which  we sit, and  the sofas penetrate our  body” (Boccioni 1975: 67). “What  emanates from bodies  and  what  emanates from architectural surrounds intermix” (Arakawa and Gins 2002: 61). A modal location  is a field of experience.
