“The  things which  are  grasped into  a realized unity,  here  and  now,  are  not  the castle, the cloud,  the planet, [and  the sofa] in themselves; but  they  are the castle, the  cloud,   the  planet  [and   the  sofa]  from   the  standpoint  of  the  prehensive [affective]  unification. In other  words, it is the standpoint of the [sofa] over there from  the standpoint of the unification here.  It is, therefore, aspects of the castle, the   cloud,   the   planet  [and   the   sofa]   which   are   grasped  into   unity   here” (Whitehead 1967: 70). This is a perspective. But it is not a perspective on a portion of the universe. It is a “perspective of the universe.” (Whitehead 1938: 108). Each realization figures  itself  out  against the  background of its own  unification, but that  figuring holds  its unity  in simultaneous contrast with  an endless abundance of  “potentialities for  alternative  realizations”(106). Its  foregrounding  of  itself configures  itself to them.  It figures  with them,  implicitly. Each decision-like event comes  into its own  individuality with an infinity  of alternate forms.  “It expresses its own  nature as being  this, and  not that  ... combined with the sense of modes of infinitude stretching beyond its own limitations.” In this sense, it implicitly “expresses its necessary relevance beyond its own  limitations.” “It  expresses a perspective of the  universe” (107-108). Its standpoint is a region  of the  world's potential, flickeringly taking  place.  It  tells  of intense experience nested in  the larger  penumbral region  of dimmer experience. It is a perspective of experience, in  the  same  sense  in  which  it  is  a  perspective of  the  universe. The  world  is landing sites within landing sites; regions of experience within larger  experience. The  world is the  larger  of the  experience. It is of experience, for  larger  or  for smaller. Every experience is a worlding. To land  is to world.
