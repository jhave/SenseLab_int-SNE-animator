JL: Exactly. You get that catharsis in the most traditional, conventional way. The form  is  absolutely  conventional, and  then you   walk  out of  the film  feeling satisfied.   That   feeling   of   satisfaction   is   disturbing   to  me.  You   become the equivalent  of  a couch potato. It’s all  been thought and digested for you  and presented to you in nice easy morsels, and at no point has something that you assumed  to be true been truly  confronted.  And that’s a lot  of  what constitutes “political films” now.
