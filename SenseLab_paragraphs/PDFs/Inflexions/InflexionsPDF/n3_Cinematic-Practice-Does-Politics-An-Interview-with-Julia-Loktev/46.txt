NH: But one is hinted at. The film plays back and forth with this kind of ambiguity, between belief and non-belief. At times,  it’s hard to tell what the protagonist is feeling  and it’s  never said—she  hardly  says  anything  through  out the film.  Her facial expression and bodily movements are unreadable, but very pronounced at the same  time. It’s impossible  to reduce  it to an emotion. The  film remains ambiguous in this way, but the ambiguity of the film is also what makes it so that the experience of watching her  is intense. It’s very affective.
