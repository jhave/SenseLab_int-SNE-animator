JL: Spoiler alert. That’s  what they do on IMDB, “spoiler alert.” I never care. I never care if people tell me the endings of movies. I  am always interested in how you get toward something, not what happens. But yeah, we can talk  about the end. I  was  really  only interested  in making a film about a girl  who sets out to be  a suicide bomber and fails. I was interested in her failure. The film wasn’t about the radicalization  of  this girl;  it wasn’t  about how she  came to make a decision.  It was a film about this girl who already made a decision but fails to carry it out.
