glossy  ones. I  finally  understood  why  they called  those guitars  or  cars  “candy apple red,” that’s the kind of red. I have to confess something, a little cheat. We discovered it was impossible to buy a candy apple in Times Square. They don’t sell candy apples in Times Square. So we spent the first four hours of the morning of  the shoot going  all  over New York  City  trying  to find  candied apples.  So they’re not as common as you think. But it seems it’s the kind of thing that should be sold in Times Square.
