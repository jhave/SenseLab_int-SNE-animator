academic speak  is   so  rusty  it  doesn’t even move at this point.  I  am not sure if coffee or beer is enough to lubricate it into moving. So, in some ways I think we have to bridge the language somehow because I  don’t know how to begin to talk    about  micropolitics.     Frankly,    because   I    am  not  entirely   sure    what micropolitics is, and I  am embarrassed to admit that I  am not sure  what micropolitics is.
