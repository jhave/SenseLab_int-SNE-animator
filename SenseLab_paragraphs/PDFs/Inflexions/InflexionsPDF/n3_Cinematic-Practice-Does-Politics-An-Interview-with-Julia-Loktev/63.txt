JL:  It’s  very easy.  But to talk  about why  you  like something  becomes  so much more difficult,  and then you  almost don’t want to.  I  stopped  taking film theory classes   as  an  undergrad—very  traditional   film   studies   classes   where  you watched movies  and analysed  them. I  didn’t like  watching  movies  and then liking  them and then talking about them with  people that I  didn’t necessarily like. I  felt like I  was sharing something so private and  so dear to me that I  didn’t want to share. I even have a hard time walking out of a movie with a friend and talking about it. I feel like it kills it to talk  about it. And at the same time, I feel that films should be jumping-off points for discussion, not necessarily for analysis, but a jumping-off  point to talk   about something  else,  where  the film  leads you   to rather than the film itself. But I do think there is something wrong about the fact that I can talk  about things I don’t like better than about the things I do like. I just told you   about this  film,  The  Headless  Woman, I   am really   not being  very articulate.  There  is  another film  I  saw  this  week, Violence  at Noon, an Oshima film that I got very excited by,  and yet  if you ask  me to describe it to you I would fail completely. I would just say go see it.
