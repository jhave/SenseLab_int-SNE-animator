To me, it  was  just  about a closed  door  that can‘t be reopened.  I  had to re- record  it  a bunch of  times  to make  the parents  nicer and nicer,  probably  too nice, because  people  would just  go into  these elaborate  explanations  that it was  all  about the parents,  and that she  had a fight   with   her  parents.  The audience is used to looking  for clues that are supposed  to mean something  or explain  everything.  I   think   that’s  one thing  that’s  often  been misinterpreted about my  intentions. It wasn’t my  intention to say that you shouldn’t ask why,  or that the why  is inexplicable, or that there is no why.  No, it just  happened to be not what this  particular  story  was  about.  A story  is not necessarily  the whole story. You can tell a love story where you talk about how two people meet, and you can tell a love story where you don’t tell how they met and you just pick it up at the point where they’ve been married for four years.
