NH: I’ve talked to a few people who also watched the film and walked out of it at the end feeling this bodily tension in their  gut. For me, that was the case, and for a few  friends I went to see it with,  for sure. It’s an intensity that’s felt with  the situation that’s  unfolding  on the screen.  You  walk  out of  the film feeling,  not stressed out, but like you’ve carried something with you  the entire time that’s still inarticulable once you leave the cinema.
