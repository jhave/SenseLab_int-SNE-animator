NH: I feel that when a work attaches itself to me it’s usually because I can’t say why  I  liked it or  disliked it. So coming to interview  you  I  was  nervous because  I wasn’t sure how to ask questions about a work that did just that—attach itself to me in this sort of sensorial way. Because I feel too that once I begin to talk about a work  and try to explain why  a work  moved me or why  I liked a work  it’s always going to be not exactly that. The effect of the work on me changes and it is no longer that which I had felt once I try to explain it.
