JL: Yes. I think a lot of the time I tend to focus on hands or on body movements— I was going to say more than face but that’s not true, as much as face but more than words—because  there is  so  much that can come across  in  how a hand moves, in  how a person  moves  their  body in  that moment to reflect  a feeling. That’s so much more interesting to me than what people say. I am interested in the kind of talk  that people might be having in a particular situation versus talk that’s for the  audience’s benefit, about explaining something to an audience.
