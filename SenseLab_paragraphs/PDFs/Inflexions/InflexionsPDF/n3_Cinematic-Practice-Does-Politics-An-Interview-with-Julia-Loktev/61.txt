JL:  Maybe  we should have  sat here  silently  and watched each other drink.  In general,  it’s  much easier  for me to say why   I  don’t like  something,  because usually the things I  don’t like are very easy to talk  about and easy to define. So it’s very easy for me to just  bitch.  There is a clarity to it. Bad reviews are always juicier  than good reviews.
