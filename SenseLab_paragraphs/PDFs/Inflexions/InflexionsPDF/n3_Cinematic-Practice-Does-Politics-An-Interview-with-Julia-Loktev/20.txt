JL:  We  all  want to believe  that they are  dangerous  to somebody else. People have the sense  that ‘Of  course,  I  knew all  of  this,  but there is  somebody out there who needed  to learn  it.’  It’s the way  people  approach  Michael  Moore films—I am using that as a kind of very shorthand example—because there are plenty  of  other films  like  that, both fiction  and documentary.  People  say, ‘Well yes, of course, I  knew everything he’s saying, but you know those other people needed  to learn this,  to them this  is dangerous.’  But  of  course  it’s not those “other  people” that are going to this  movie. The  people to whom it might be possibly dangerous are in no position to receive it or have no interest in it. So, in fact, the people who go to see it are the ones who feel very safe and who don’t feel  the slightest  bit  endangered  by the argument,  usually.    So,  what does it mean to be dangerous,  and  to whom? Something  should be  dangerous  to yourself, in some way, not to some imaginary other.
