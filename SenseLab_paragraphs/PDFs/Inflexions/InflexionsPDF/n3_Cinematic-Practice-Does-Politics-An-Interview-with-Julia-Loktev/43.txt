JL: The last shot I  filmed myself because it was supposed to be a kind of shot of nothing that  had  the  potential to  be  something.  It’s  very  difficult  to shoot nothing  that has the potential  to be something.  It’s very  difficult.  It’s almost  like the photograph of  the little  brother—something  can be too overloaded  with meaning. At the end, she’s looking for a sign, and I suppose a believer can see a sign  in  anything,  where another person  might  see absolutely  nothing.  So,  I wanted the potential  of  a sign  but possibly  the potential  for no  sign  at all.  I would go out by  myself long after we had edited the film and I would go across from   Port   Authority, a block  away  from   Times  Square,  and  go out to shoot nothing. I  tried thirty  takes  of  nothing and they didn’t  work very well,  and then finally  I  did manage  to shoot nothing.   I  liked  the idea  of  having  a conclusion that people could  enter  into  from  different  positions,  within  faith or  outside of faith, or in completely different ways. And there is no right or wrong way.
