NH: In  one interview  I  also  read you  said  something  about when people try to recollect a traumatic event and talk  about what they had just gone through— and this  was  something  you  said  in  the interview  that struck  me—is the way  in which they recalled banal details. Like this one woman, who was there on September  11th,  could only recall  losing  one of  her  shoes  and walking  around with a bare foot. This reminded me of the girl and her ritual of eating in the film, which  plays  a role  in  how she grounds  herself  as  she moves  in  the future  and past of what’s about to happen. She’s about to blow herself up.
