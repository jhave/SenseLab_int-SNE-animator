NH: I  noticed that in Day  Night Day  Night there were a lot of close-up shots on gestures. For example, this occurs in the scene of the first attempt at detonation. The intensity is felt very strongly because of how you  shot it using close-ups. These close-up shots focused on people’s hands, and the backs of their neck—micro- gestures—while  they’re  waiting  to cross  the street  with  the about to become suicide-bomber.  You  didn’t focus  on their  faces  but their  body movements  in parts as they stood waiting.
