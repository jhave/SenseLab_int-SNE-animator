JL:That’s part  of  the reason why  I  wanted the credits to be silent,  to let  people catch their  breath again and to just  sit  with  it a little  bit.  It’s  always  been very quiet when I’ve done Q &A’s after the film and when the lights come back on. There is always this kind of uncomfortable silence.   It was like that with my  other film too, Moment of Impact. And maybe that ties back into what we started out talking about—what  the  political can be—in  thesense  that   the work is not entirely finished. There is not a sense of a complete arc, something that you’ve gone through and now you know exactly what you feel, “Yes, I am satisfied.” It doesn’t necessarily stop where you expected  it to. I  thought it should be interrupted rather than concluded. So, the end can be a kind of beginning to a conversation,  and it’s  a conversation  that doesn’t have to involve  me and should not involve me most of the time.
