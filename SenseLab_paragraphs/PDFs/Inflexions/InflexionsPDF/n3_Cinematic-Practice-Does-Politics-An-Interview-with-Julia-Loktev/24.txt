know what the flesh is, literally. I need to find the flesh, and then figure out how it’s going to be in the film because it doesn’t come fully formed all at once in my mind.  I  am not somebody who can visualize a film  entirely  beginning  to end in my  head. I  think if  I can visualize it entirely (beginning to end)there is no reason to make it. There are filmmakers I  respect, like Hitchcock, who could visualize a film entirely.  I can’t. I am simply not capable of it. I need the real world to force me into situations and force me to come up with solutions.
