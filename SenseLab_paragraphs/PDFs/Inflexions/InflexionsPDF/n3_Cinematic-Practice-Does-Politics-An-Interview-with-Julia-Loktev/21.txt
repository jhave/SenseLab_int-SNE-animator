NH: I  start  to think  about how cinema today  experiments  with  technique.  For every new project  we begin  we engage with  an experiment  that is  going  to create a set   of   techniques,  right,   depending  on what the  project   is   and depending on the process.  I  was  thinking,  how do you then pay  attention  to your  own practice  (in  how you   create  your  techniques)  to try  and do things differently each time you make a film or experiment with an idea? How do  you think  about what you  want to do that’s going to be different  or  challenging? I don’t even know if that’s answerable.
