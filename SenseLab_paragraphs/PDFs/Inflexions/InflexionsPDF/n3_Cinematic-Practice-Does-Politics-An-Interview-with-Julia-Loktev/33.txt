NH: I  think  I  read  somewhere that you also  didn’t want the audience  to grasp onto something she would say that would justify her act or give an explanation for  what  she was  about  to do. And yet  the  prayers  kind  of   give  hints   at something,  especially  when she says,  “I  want this  death to be for you,”  this almost hints at giving a reason for her action.
