NH: For  me, from  what I  understand  from  what he’s  writing  about in  terms of affection-images, is that it’s something where you’re instantly affected by  what you’re seeing on the screen without necessarily recognizing how it’s making you feel;  it’s pre-cognitive,  operating outside what he calls  spatio-temporal coordinates.  It’s  felt  before it can be articulated or  reduced to something  we can recognize in language. A lot of the time, to explain this, I’ve heard people use examples of going to see a horror film and describing this moment before it is   that  you recognize   you’re   scared;   so  it’s   that  moment before   you  can determine the emotion as being scared;it’s before you can determine or define what has just affected you. And for me,  I  would say that your film would be an affection-image.
