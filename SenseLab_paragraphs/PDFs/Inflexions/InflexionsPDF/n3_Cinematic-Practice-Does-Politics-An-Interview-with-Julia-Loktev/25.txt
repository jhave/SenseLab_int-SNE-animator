NH: My question to you  that I thought about just while  you  were talking is about how much intuition plays into the work? I guess I  am also asking that because I am thinking  so  much about  the kind  of  process  youâ€™re  talking  about when shooting  for instance in Times Square  and how it becomes  about a pragmatic intuitive process somehow.
