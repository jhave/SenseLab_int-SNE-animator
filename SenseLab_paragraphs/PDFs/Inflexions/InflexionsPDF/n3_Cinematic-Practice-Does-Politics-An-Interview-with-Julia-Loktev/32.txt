JL: She had these strange prayers that she did, which I  always imagined would be subtitled.  That’s  how I   wrote  them,  to  be  subtitled. I   thought, well,  she’s speaking English, but you shouldn’t talk to your object of faith in the same way you talk to your friend; you have to have some other way of using language. It shouldn’t  sound like  a regular  conversation.  These  prayers  are  kind  of  oblique. At  the same  time, they were taken from  real sources,  from  an adaptation  of things  that I  had come across  in  my  research,  like  the prayer  “Everybody  dies. Some people  fall  from  windows and die,”  that was  taken  from  something  I’d read about a Palestinian  suicide-bomber  video. In the video, he says,  “Some people get run  over by  horses and die, some people fall off sheds...” and listed all  these different  ways  people  die, and then said  “I  want my  death to be for you”. I adapted it and I brought in a few more methods of death, changed the methods of death, but basically worked off of that.
