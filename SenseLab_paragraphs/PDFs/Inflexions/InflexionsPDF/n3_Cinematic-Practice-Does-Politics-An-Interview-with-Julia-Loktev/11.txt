NH:  I felt uneasy, as well. Because I wasn’t sure  what my intention was in trying to have an artist  talk  about her  work in relation to politics. What is my  intention in doing that? Why  is  that important for me? Why  it is important for me  to  think about politics in  relation to everyday practice and what do I  mean by  that? I realized it was a chance for me  to ask what is politics at this point, and how can we talk  about it in relation to cinema.  I  wanted to think  about it in a way  that takes the conversation away from content, from politics as content. I wanted to get at the question  of  how art  does politics—as  a way  to experiment  with creating  techniques—and  how does this  process  of  art  making  begin  to open up potential for a new articulation of politics that cannot be known yet  but that is  based  in   how  one  practices,   and  that  is   really    about  process   and experimentation.  What  does  art  do in  terms  of  enabling  new thoughts  for how the political can be articulated?
