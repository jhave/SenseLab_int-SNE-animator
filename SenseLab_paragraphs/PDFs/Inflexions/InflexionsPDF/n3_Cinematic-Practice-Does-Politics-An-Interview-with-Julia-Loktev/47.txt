JL: Sometimes even if you don’t know what a character  is thinking  you have a sense  of  the rhythm  of  her   breath,  the rhythm  of  her   physical  actions  in  that moment. This isn’t a girl that you  get to know based on knowing her back-story, knowing where she came from, where she grew up, or knowing what she’s thinking  at this  moment. You  kind  of  get to know her  based on the motions  of her  body and motions of her face, based on watching  her breathe and being drawn into  her  breathing. There was this very nice thing that somebody said to me in  Buenos  Aires  at a screening.  This  girl  came to me after  and she  said,  “A few  minutes into the film and I  felt  like I  was breathing  with her."  I  thought that was a nice comment. You feel inside this character and under her skin, without ever really knowing her thought process or who she is at all, but you  know what her  body is  doing  and how it’s  responding  to everything in  terms  of  how she’s moving   and different   ways  that her   body  reflects  degrees  of   tension  and anxiety. All of  it  is very  much about  her  body; it  plays out on her  body. I remember  when I  was  casting  the girl,  I  had all  these requirements  of  what I wanted from the girl, and one of things I  wrote in my  notes was she’s someone that events pass through and her face is constantly registering their  passing. And then I  thought it’s  not really  just  her  face  but also  her  body. Sometimes,  I  think you learn more by sitting there with somebody and watching them eat an egg roll than them telling you  something.
