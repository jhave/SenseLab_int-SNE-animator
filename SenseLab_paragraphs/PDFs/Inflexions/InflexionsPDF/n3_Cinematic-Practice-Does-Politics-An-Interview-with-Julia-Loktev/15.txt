thinking about my  work in a kind of direct political sense. I  don’t think  of it as a call  to action, as a recipe for behaviour, as a staking out of a position. But for me the most important thing is can it leave room for thought; can it leave room for argument; can it leave room for disagreement;  can somebody walk out of the film and not be so certain of what they feel. This destabilizing is maybe the most political  thing  that I  can do. Because  so  often  when we think  about political cinema  it  isn’t  necessarily  about destabilizing—especially  documentaries,  but also in fiction—there  are a lot  of  very  politically motivated  films now that are basically   preaching   to  the  choir.   They’re   about confirming   a position   and making you feel safer in your assumptions, and you see this all the time.
