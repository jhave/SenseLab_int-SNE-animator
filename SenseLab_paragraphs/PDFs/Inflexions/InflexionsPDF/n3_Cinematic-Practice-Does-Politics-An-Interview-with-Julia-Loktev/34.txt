JL: It’s not that I  didn’t  want people to grasp  onto some things.  It’s more  that I discovered once I  made the film  that people grasped onto the tiniest  shreds. I mean that was  a kind  of  unintended consequence. So  you would have these situations—there   is   a scene   where the  organizers   [of  the   suicide   bombing mission] are going through her  wallet and they’re taking her  ID and they take a photo of her  little brother, and she says, “Can I keep it?” and they refuse. Again, that was a little detail that I drew from an article about this girl that I researched a lot  on, a Chechen girl,  who set  out to be a suicide  bomber in  Moscow and failed. She said she was kind of sad because they wouldn’t let her take a picture of  her  daughter with  her.  She  just  wanted to keep  it.   It was  not that she was trying to do this for her daughter, it was just that she wanted to take the picture of her  daughter with her.  So, I used this detail and substituted a picture of a little brother,  and I’ve  had people make up elaborate  narratives  that it’s all about the little brother.  Whereas,  I  just  thought, she knows she’s going  to die and she wants  to have a picture  of  her  little  brother,  it’s  not anything  more  than that. I found   that  in  a  vacuum, people started   attaching   incredible   amounts   of importance to the slightest  detail. So,  you  almost couldn’t  have any personal
