[9]  Though  the  study  by  Koshino   et  al.  doesn’t  mention  Applied  Behavior Analysis, it’s clear that  ABA is not  the  kind  of therapy the  authors recommend. ABA focuses  on reducing inappropriate behaviors, not  on improving brain connectivity.  For  this  and   other   reasons,  the  vast   majority  of  self-advocates vigorously oppose ABA. See (Koshino  et al. 2005).
