The  two   epigraphs  stage   this   connection  between  words  and   images   as  a common matter  of  fingers   and  a  disparate matter of  technique. “Creation of dramatic painting starts  each time  in the movement of fingers  on sopping, great malleable gobs  of paint,” Bissonnette writes  in the  second sentence of the  first epigraph. This statement surely  reflects what  Erin Manning, referring to Amanda Baggs,  calls  “articulation through  sensation” (2009a:  215).  It  is  literally  “felt thought” (Manning 2009a: 214; my emphasis). The synecdoche of fingers  makes manifest both  the  problem of bodily  integrity and  the  instrument of hyper and hypo-sensation in classical autism. Dispensing with  a brush, Bissonnette’s fingers make  direct  contact  with  the  “sopping, great  malleable gobs  of paint.” One  can almost  feel language emerging from  this tactile  encounter. In contrast, “typing is like letting  your  finger  hit keys  with  accuracy.” “Leniency on that,”  Bissonnette notes,   “is  not  tolerated.”  Not  only  does   the  keyboard  seem  to  provide less palpable input, the  need  to  be  both  independent and  precise,  which  requires strenuous  effort  in  the  face  of  significant sensorimotor  challenges, produces stress.  “Am  easily  language impaired,” he  remarks, aware of his  characteristic typos  and  syntactical errors.
