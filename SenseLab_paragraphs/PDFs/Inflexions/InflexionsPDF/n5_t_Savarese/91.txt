Because   FC  allows   an   autist   to  “perform  as  a  self  in  relation  to  others,” Cartwright believes  that  the  “facilitator thus  facilitates the  very  structure of the order of language, her organizing activities having left a…change in the way the psyche processes the  input and  output of  feeling  rather than  simply existing there  in  the  psyche as  remembered  content of  someone who  has  been  there, touching” (2008: 221). “What  is imparted,” she continues, “is perhaps a blueprint for bodily  delimitation and  control.  The prosthesis of the  facilitator is a training ground   for   future   anticipation  of   self-controlled   action    with    an   other” (Cartwright 2008: 222). Not  complete delimitation,  to  be  sure,  but  enough to make  linguistic communication possible:  both  as a motoric act—“Damn hard to nail  accurately letters”  (Bissonnette 2001b),  Bissonnette says--and  as  a psychological desire.  Perhaps this is why  Bissonnette required full facilitation at the beginning of his language journey, even as he was making art independently, and  why  he still requires intermittent contact  on the  shoulder or back  when he types.  By comparison, painting is much  less technically demanding, which  is to say exactingly social. A given  work  need  not be representational or symbolic;  it may  simply depict “intuitions of plentiful feelings  and  sensations.” It may  begin and  end “in the movement of fingers  on sopping, great  malleable gobs of paint.”
