But don’t think  for a second that  Bissonnette is unaware of the politics  of artistic production and  quality—how even his preferred domain can be regulated by disciplinary pressures. In the  passage from  which  the  second epigraph is taken, he writes,  "Others  would say serious art is made  creatively holding paint  brushes nicely in a proper art school way. Scrap that approach. Work like Larry on letting your  hands take off on the large  paper without dealing with  orderly way  of premeditating every  stroke” (Inclusion Institutes n.d.). Bissonnete wants to fly, as his  implied metaphor  makes   clear,  in  an  utterly untutored  and   unrestricted fashion. In  doing so,  he  can  give  the  sky  its  “vivider dayglo colors”;  he  can dispense with  a simple  notion of the  “real”  or  “given.”  Notice  that  when he speaks  of linguistic communication, he says, “Typing is like letting  your  finger  hit keys  with  accuracy” (Inclusion Institutes n.d.;  my  emphasis). That  “like”  may reflect a compulsive analogizing, so that  an object may even need  to be like itself, but  the  word also  asks  us  to consider something else: inaccurate typing, letting your  finger  “take  off” on the keys, disrespecting all manner of convention. What if we were  to “tolerate leniency?” Bissonnette seems  slyly  to suggest. He wants “splashing language,” repaired relation through metaphor—“great gobs”  of it. Typing  is really like  letting  your  finger  hit  whatever keys  it wants. In  such  a scenario, the  alphabet potentially crumbles--not only  words but  also letters  lose their  distinctions. Perhaps they even become  figures  for one another.
