[18]  Hermelin  views   her   subject,   a  young  woman  named  Kate,   as  having produced such  figures  in the explicit  context  of writing poetry, and  yet she can’t help  but  disparage the  accomplishment:  “But  even  with  her  limited grasp and ability  to  search  consciously for  such  representations…” (2004: 61), Hermelin writes;  “In a minor,  modest way,  and  in spite of her poems’ limitations…” (2004:
62), she  repeats. Why  bother to  explore   the  apparent paradox of  disability  if
you’re only going  to use your  subject’s impairment to undercut that ability?
