Synesthesia joins with  another figure  of speech,  personification, to re-animate the world—in this  case  anxiously. Born  of  a  literal  experience,  the  perception is received by neurotypicals figuratively (“The spoon  has grown quiet.”). And  yet, the  senses   always  proceed  by  analogy—just  more   noticeably  with   autistics. Perhaps the  literal  itself is a mystification, as it only  emerges when unnaturally alienated from its sensorial siblings.
