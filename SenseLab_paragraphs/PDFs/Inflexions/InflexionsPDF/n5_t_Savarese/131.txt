[6] Tito Mukhopadhyay speaks  about  writing poetry in exactly  this  way.  In an interview with  him  entitled “More  Than  a  Thing  to  Ignore,” I asked,   “Does reading poetry calm  your  anxiety?  If so, what  kind?  Does  it need  to rhyme, be metrical?  Does  writing  poetry  alleviate anxiety?   Earlier   you  spoke   of  poetry giving  you  a "secure  feeling."  Mukhopadhyay responded, “A  rhyme is a very linear   auditory  experience. And   so  is  the  beat  —  be  it  in  tetrameter  or  in pentameter. It arouses the cortical  mind with  certain  meaningful language experience  and   arouses  the   subcortical  mind  with   the   expectation  of  the mechanical beat  that  is offered  by the  lines  of the  poem.  Anxiety  is subcortical. Anxiety  gets  diluted by  the  experience. That  is what  makes  it soothing. In my book How Can I Talk If My Lips Don't Move? I have  written about  a link between the auditory experience and  a motor  learning process of tying  my shoelaces. The anxiety   of  some   new  learning  process gets  diluted with   those   stories   about colorful  strings” (Savarese  2010a).
