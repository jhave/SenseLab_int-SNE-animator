The poem  finds  in the image  of that  very  colorful,  new  world parrot a figure  for the autistic painter who knows something of institutionalized living.  The work  is subtly  synesthetic, as we are asked  to ponder the relationship between sight  and sound in a poem  written by  a painter. The disparate analogical referents have been  made   to  fit,  which   is  to  say  that   a  specific  context   (poetry)  has  been exploited. The  clear  social  awareness and  witty  indirection astonish. That  the bird   is  nearly  extinct   seems   to  lurk   behind  the  poem,   resonating  with   the oppression of people who  are neurologically different. The implied analogy of a silent  film  star  points not  only  to  a more  hospitable medium for  nonspeaking people, one  in  which  speech  is irrelevant, but  also,  conversely, to  the  role  of technology in making synthetic speech  possible.  And  while  the poem  clearly deprecates the oral language production of the classical  autist,  comparing the characteristic echolalia, in another technological metaphor, to a broken tape,  it saves  its real venom for the effects of what  might  be called,  adapting Rosemarie Garland  Thomson’s  phrase,  an  “economy  of  auditory  difference” (Thomson
1997). [19] The intense investment in normative behavior generates the  need  to stare  and  incarcerate, to demonize departures from  neurotypicality exactly  as it renders them  objects of fascination. Hence,  the metaphorical zoo and  “tacky sideshow.”  Bissonnette pits the celebrity of the silent film star against this sort of attention, imagining a dynamic and  accomplished role  for  himself  (and  others like him) in the public  sphere.
