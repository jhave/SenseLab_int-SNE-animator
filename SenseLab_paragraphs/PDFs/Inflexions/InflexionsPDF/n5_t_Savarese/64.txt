might   lose  the  conscious awareness  of  any  information coming through other  senses.  Thus,  while  [he] sees something, he does  not understand what  he is being told and  does not feel touch.  When  the visual  stimulus fades  out,  the sound can be processed, but then  the sound is the  only  information the  person is dealing with (disconnected  from   sight).   As  the   person  focuses   on  only   one modality at a time, the sound may be experienced as louder (hypersensitivity) because it is all the person focuses  on (2004: 79).
