In places,  the letters  appear partially smudged, as if the paint  underneath hadn’t entirely dried  and   the  new   paint   had   begun  to  mingle   with   it.  The  short commentary reads:  “Powered print  treats  painted images  well  as long  as colors Larry  selects match.  Larry  loves pink  and  purple because pressured painter gets to lighten stroke” (Biklen 2005: 176). It’s almost  impossible to miss the “p”s  and “r”s  and  “t”s—all  of those  inherently meaningless but  nonetheless pleasurable, because patterned, sound effects.  It’s  also  difficult  to  miss  the  attention to  the activity   of  painting itself:  the  preference for  lighter  strokes and   perhaps the sensory requirements for producing them.  Bissonnette paints independently; he does  not  need  the  touch  of facilitation, though he does  need  a kind  of coach  or “persuader to do great  art when creativity is clashing with  serious autistic stubbornness” (My Classic Life 2005)—a distinction to which  I will return.
