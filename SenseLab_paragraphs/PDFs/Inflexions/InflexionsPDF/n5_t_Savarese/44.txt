And  yet, the “blindness” of cross-wired sensory perception or synesthetic media simply reflects  exaggerated interaction: one sense  or medium doing the work  of its partner. It could  also be called,  without any pejorative connotations, deafness or another impairment of the senses.  The point  is it reveals  new forms  of discernment—indeed a new  kind  of vision.  And  it instructs by foregrounding relation: from  how  the  senses  must  cooperate in neurotypicals to perform their seemingly discrete functions (as  we  will  see  in  the  very  next  section),  to  the startling analogies that  Bissonnette produces, to the physical and  interpretive facilitation provided by caregivers. The poet  Wallace  Stevens  once  proclaimed, with   uncanny  relevance,  “The   senses   paint/by   metaphor…The truth  must be/that  you  do  not  see,  you  experience, you  feel,/  that  the  buxom eye  brings merely its  element/to  the  total  thing” (1972: 197). Echoing  this  point,   Michel Serres  contends, “The  eye loses  its pre-eminence in the  very  area  in which  it is dominant, in painting”(2009: 37). “The  painter makes  us see through touch,” he says  (140). Analogously, “the  skin  has  eyes,  like a peacock’s tail”  (37), and  “we hear through our skin and feet” (141).
