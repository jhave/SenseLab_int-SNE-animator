Beyond   the   “movement  lapses”  of  classical   autism,  it  is  the   penchant  for sensation without interpretation—what Williams  calls the “unlost instinct”—that can   inhibit   linguistic  sociality.   With   Amanda  Baggs,   we   can   see  how   the “symphony of sound and  movement” (Manning 2009b: 42) in “In My Language” fails to line  up  with  any  conventional notion of personhood. As Erin  Manning puts  it in  “What  If It Didn’t  All Begin  and  End  with  Containment? Toward a Leaky   Sense  of  Self,”  “We  watch   entranced  as  [Baggs]  moves   through  the environment  and   it  moves   through  her,   feeling-with  its  forms   and   forces, expressing it as  it expresses her”  (Manning 2009b: 40). The  “language” of the video’s title,  which  Baggs explicitly contrasts with  ordinary symbolic language, reflects  a radical interconnectedness—to the  extent  that  entities fail to be strictly themselves.
