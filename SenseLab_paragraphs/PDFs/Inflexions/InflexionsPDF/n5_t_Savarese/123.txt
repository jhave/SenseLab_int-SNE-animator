The  poem  is  very  clever.  It  analogically condenses all  sorts  of  things, and  in giving   us  an  image   of  the   painterly  poet—maybe  even   the   painted  poet-- Bissonnette allows  us  to see something like the  cross-wired body  of the  arts:  a kind  of autistic new  media in which  an autist,  with  the help  of a computer and  a facilitator, brushes  on  gobs  and   gobs  of  metaphor  to  create   his  “muralistic lettered view  of life.” Who  knows what  might  happen if classical  autistics laid repeated  claim   to   writing   poems?  Who    knows  what    might    happen  if neurotypicals practiced a more  sense-based approach in their  own  work,  to say nothing of allowing poetry to spill  into  the  conversational quotidian? Each side of  the   neurological  divide  ought  to  be  given   appropriate  instruction  and therapies; each  side  ought to grab  its neurological passport.  “Promising strides of valiant” await.
