In a chapter about  an autistic poet from her sadly  pathologizing and  patronizing book, Bright Splinters of the Mind: A Personal Story of Research with Autistic Savants, Beate Hermelin concedes that  the “less contextual and  the more  open  to various interpretations a metaphor is, the  greater the  possibility of its evoking complex mental   processes”  (2001:  60)   and,   further,  that   the   “least   obvious,  least stereotyped references will result  in the most  powerful poetic  effects”  (2001: 61). [18] Bissonnette’s metaphors clearly evoke complex mental processes, and  clearly they  are not at all stereotyped. The question is: are these  metaphors apt? Do they come  to seem  inevitable—at once  surprising and  crucially necessary? Or is this the wrong question? For what  we have  been  analyzing is something like poetry but not yet a poem.
