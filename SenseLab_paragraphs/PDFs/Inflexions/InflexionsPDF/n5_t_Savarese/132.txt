[7] See Oliver  Sacksâ€™ profile  of Temple  Grandin in An Anthropologist on Mars for a description of this machine, which  Grandin devised and  constructed after extrapolating from  her  long  experience with  cattle.    She  found that  she  could lessen   their   anxiety   and   facilitate   easy,  purposeful  movement by  employing rounded chutes  that  hugged them.  The  principle of deep  pressure is key  here.
