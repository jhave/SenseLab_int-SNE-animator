to imagine what  autism might  sometimes be like and  how  any conception of the self is inextricably tied  to the physical body.  Sacks concludes, “She has lost, with her  sense  of proprioception, the  fundamental, organic mooring of identity—at least  that  corporeal identity, or body-ego, which  Freud sees as the  basis  of self” (quoted in Waterhouse 1998: 53). But we  need  not  look  beyond autism itself  to understand the  significance of an alternative neurology. A “lack  of control  over volition and  self-directed expressive action”  (Waterhouse 1998: 222), “problems…with a sense of being in a unitary, discrete body” (222), “fragmented perceptions of her  own  body  and  its environment” (222)—all of these  things, in Lisa Cartwright’s summary of Donna Williams’ challenges, plague people with autism.
