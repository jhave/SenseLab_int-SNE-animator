Alex   smells   and   touches  objects   or   food   to   check   his   visual perception   of   them.    Sometimes   he   shuts    down   his    vision completely and uses his ears to “see” his environments. He can recognize the objects by the sounds they  produce much  better  than their  visual  images.  The disadvantage of this  “auditory seeing” is that  when his  hearing becomes  overloaded and  cannot cope  with auditory and   “visual”  information,  it  may  either   become hypersensitive  (and   painful)  or  shut   down  altogether. Then   he finds  his  “world” unusually quiet  (“The  spoon  has  grown quiet”) and  dangerous. It leads to panic  attacks.
