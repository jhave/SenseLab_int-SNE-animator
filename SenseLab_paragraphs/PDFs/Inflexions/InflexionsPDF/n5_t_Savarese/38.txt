What  if, like the  study’s participants, Bissonnette remembers letters  visually, as shapes? What  if his right  hemisphere is doing the work  ordinarily performed by the  left  hemisphere, with  the  resulting abundance of  metaphor and  imagistic detail,  not  to mention the  syntactical problems associated with  left-hemispheric dysfunction (or relative inactivity)? What  if, in other  words, Bissonnette has somehow achieved the  greater connectivity required for  higher order thinking but has retained atypical cerebral dominance and  activation patterns? Then language, as in a recent  poem  by Mukhopadhyay about  birds  on electrical  wires, would be more  like calligraphy: a pleasing design that  also did  symbolic work (Mukhopadhyay 2010). [10] It would lose its strictly  utilitarian function, and  the typical   excess  of  poetry, its  infra-symbolic intentions, would  be  taken  a  step further. Bissonnette’s  lack  of subordinate clauses—“Nasty residential better  for growing  vegetables  rather  than   people,  Brandon   Training  School”--clearly reveals  a problem with  syntax,  but  it’s  as  if the  modifiers are  standing in  for details perceived before  the  apprehension of  a  whole   and,   thus,   must   come before that whole  (and  the word it goes by).
