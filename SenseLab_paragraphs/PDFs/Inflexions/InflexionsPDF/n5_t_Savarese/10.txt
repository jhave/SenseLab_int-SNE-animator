In  his  short  commentary [2] on  a  “papal red”  painting entitled “Birds  would violate   airline   dapper  standards for  appearance  but   the  skies  sport   vivider dayglo colors  when it can fly freely  and  uncensored by mankind” (Biklen 2005:
179),  autistic painter  Larry   Bissonnette  imagines  a  realm   of  unencumbered artistic  activity.   “Not  allowing people with  disabilities their  patterns of inspiring art through total freedom of expression,” he reiterates, “is like limiting creativity with  censorship” (Biklen 2005: 179). As he notes  in another commentary, [3] part of which  serves  as the essay’s first epigraph, verisimilitude doesn’t interest him; rather, he  paints to  his  senses,  and  the  senses  in  autism are  often  especially charged.  With   tremendous  wit  he  links   the  “vivider  dayglo  colors”   of  the painting’s skies with  the birds’ freedom to soar  as they  wish.   There  would be a violation  of  airliner  decorum,  he  contends,  if  winged  restrictions—what he figures  as censorship--were in place.
