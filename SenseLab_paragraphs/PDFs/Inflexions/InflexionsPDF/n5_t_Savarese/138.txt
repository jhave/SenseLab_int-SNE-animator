[13] Jamie Burke deserves his own  essay,  and  indeed the book  I’m writing has a chapter devoted to him.  As if to prove  the  link  between movement and  speech, when Jamie learned to speak,  not  only  did  he first need  to type  what  he spoke, but  he also couldn’t read  aloud anything  that  he hadn’t produced with  his own hand.  Eventually  he   learned  how   to  read   texts   that   he   hadn’t   physically authored, though even  now,   when  anxious, he  prefers to  type   his  thoughts before  speaking them,  as he did  recently in an Iowa  Public  Radio interview with me.
