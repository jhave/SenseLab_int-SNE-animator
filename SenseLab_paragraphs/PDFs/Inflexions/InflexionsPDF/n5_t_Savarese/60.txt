Here  Massumi helps  us  to understand just  how  dynamically and  cumulatively integrated are  the  sensing faculties  and,  further, how  their  dysfunction might cause experience to flounder. A philosopher very much  interested in aesthetic practices, he encourages us  to entertain overtly synesthetic projects  where “the body   and   thought  [are]  together  in  sensation”  (Massumi  2002:  97),  projects whose  medium is the “body as sensible  concept” (90). Surely,  autistic writers and painters fit this  bill. But let us stay  with  the  sensory and  movement challenges they  face in order to better  understand the role of touch  in language production. It’s   worth  reiterating  the   range    of   sensory  challenges:  gestalt   perception, fragmented perception, fragmented gestalt  perception, delayed perception, distortion, hypersensitivity, hyposensitivity, inconsistent hyper- and hyposensitivity, sensory overload, sensory agnosia, and  systems shutdown. Add to these  sensory issues  profound problems with  proprioception, vestibular functioning, and  body  percept, and  it’s a wonder classical  autistics don’t throw up their  arms—or, rather, flap—and quit.
