[2] In his book, Autism  and the Myth of the Person Alone, Biklen included a number of Bissonnette’s paintings, and  he asked  Bissonnette to write  some  short commentaries on  them.  When  I use  the  word “commentary,” I am  referring to these  writings, which  Biklen  does  not  analyze. I am  especially grateful to  Dr. Biklen  for  allowing me  to reproduce three  of the  photographs of Bissonnette’s paintings that appear in his book and  to the Syracuse University Copy Center  for making digital copies of these photographs.
