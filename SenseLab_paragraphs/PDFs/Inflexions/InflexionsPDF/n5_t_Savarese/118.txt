Rather  than  thinking of these  figures  as far-fetched, we  might  think  of them  as far-fetching: the  sensing body  on foot beyond the  furthest reaches  of town,  the sensing mind discovering and  naming the world through relation. The point  is to re-stitch what  has  been  ripped apart, made  arbitrarily distinct and  separate. In the  capital  of Iowa  we boast  a “living  history” farm,  replete with  costumes and time-specific farming implements. Why not living  poetry, striding metaphor, but without the  costumes? Why  not  the  world as processual painting:  perception’s freedom march?   We might  conceive  of Bissonnette’s metaphorizing as a kind  of thought-feeling neuro-cosmopolitanism, a witty  and  relentless globalization of the  mind made  possible by the  legacy  of FC’s typed massage. To play  with  the subtitle  of  Serres’  The  Five  Senses,  what   we   encounter  in  Bissonnette  is  a philosophy of mingled bodies  in a moving and  thoroughly mingled world.
