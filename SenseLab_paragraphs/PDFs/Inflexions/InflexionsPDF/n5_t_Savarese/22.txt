Exploring the notion of a “typed massage,” one needs  to be ever conscious of the two kinds  of input or touch  that Bissonnette receives  (from the paint  or keyboard and  from  his  facilitator) and,  as  well,  of the  performed relationscape that  FC enacts,   a  relationscape  amplified  by  Bissonnette’s  myriad,  often   mixed,   and spatially attuned metaphors. FC, Bissonnette writes,  “lands basis for neurological collection  of spatial awareness. Ladle  of doing language meaningfully is lost in the soup  of disabled map  of autism so I need  potholder of touch  to grab  it” (My Classic Life 2005).  The  potholder  of  touch   rescues   the  heated  instrument  of linguistic expression from  the mesmerizing murk of autism. Mediating the customary tactile  encounter, it helps  to gather crucial  information about  the  pot (proprioception) and  thereby makes  ladling (or typing) possible. Put too simply, organized language requires an organized, or at least  semi-organized, body.  It’s as if this sort  of metaphorizing were  the concrete working out  of sensory input: the  mind and  body  trying to position themselves in space  in order to function productively. In an essay on Tito Mukhopadhyay, perhaps the world’s most well known non-speaking Autist,  I speak  of a postcolonial “aroundness” that accompanies atypical proprioception (Savarese  2010b); something very  similar  is happening  here,   especially when  the  figures   endeavor  to  map   problems  of injustice.  As he ponders objects, concepts and  words, Bissonnette tries to feel his way into new relations.
