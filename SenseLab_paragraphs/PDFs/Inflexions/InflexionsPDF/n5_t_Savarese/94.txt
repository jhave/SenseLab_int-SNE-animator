Elsewhere  Bissonnette  speaks    of   “rhythmic  painting.”  For   many    classical autistics rhythm helps  to generate and  sustain purposeful movement. Here  the “strides of valiant” condense an  “alliance” of people on  the  move,  overcoming justice lapses,  their legs and  typing arms  creating egalitarian brushstrokes. No “stumbler   of   communication,”   Bissonnette   makes    of   painting   and,    by implication, of the  Autist/facilitator/computer triad  a figure  of dynamic cooperation. Art  and  politics  have  been  reunited through metaphor—through what  Bissonnette calls the “true  freedom of splashing language,” painting’s synesthetic partner or analog.  Indeed, art has been reunited with  life itself, as the former refuses  to be limited by any  narrow sense  of where it belongs or what  it can  or  cannot accomplish politically. The  charge  of mixed  metaphors doesn’t even  apply or,  rather it  seems   obtuse,  as  this  physio-cognitive and   politico- aesthetic massage—this muscular message--seeks to repair division. It will  not settle for anything less than  a complex web of enabling relations.
