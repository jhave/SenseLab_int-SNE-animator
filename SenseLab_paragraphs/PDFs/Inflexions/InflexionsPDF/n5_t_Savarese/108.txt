their   figurative  origins.   Instead  of  relegating  metaphor  to   the   “source  of imagination and  creativity in adult life,” as Edelman does,  Bissonnette gives  it a more  central,  or  at least  visible,  role  in human cognition. In the  words of Iain McGilchrist, metaphor “underlies all forms of understanding whatsoever, science and philosophy no less than  poetry and  art”  (2010: 71). “Metaphor (subserved by the right   hemisphere)  comes   before denotation  (subserved  by   the   left).  This   is historical truth,” McGilchrist argues, “in  the  sense  that  denotative language… [is] derived from  metaphors founded on  immediate experience of the  tangible world” (2010: 118).
