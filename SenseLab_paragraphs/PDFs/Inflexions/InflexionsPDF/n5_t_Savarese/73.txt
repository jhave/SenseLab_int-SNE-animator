My  son,  DJ,  each  morning opens   up  multiple bottles   of  shampoo and  starts smelling  them.   Doing   so  “lubricates,” to  use  Massumi’s  word,  the  morning routine of putting on his clothes  and  brushing his teeth.  It makes  his senses—his more  reliable  senses—and his  body  work  better.  Consider how  an  experiment with  blind  children, which  stimulated their  olfactory receptors, improved their sense  of touch,  allowing them  to identify objects  more  effectively  (Ayres  1979:
142).  The  introduced  olfactory  agents   had   nothing  to  do   with   the   objects themselves, which  gave off no smell. Negotiating the front walk at school, DJ will touch  every  single  tree  that  lines  it. He  says  that  anxiety  frequently makes  him “deaf” and  that his vision  is undependable. He often loses his body.   By touching the trees,  he can find  himself;  tactile  sensation provides crucial  input while  he is on   the   move.   Sometimes,  he   purposefully  falls   to  the   ground  to  jolt  his uncoordinated  senses,   the   seat   of  his   pants  playing  a  crucial   role   in   the restoration of  multi-modal feeling.   Almost   everywhere he  goes,  he  lugs  the heaviest of backpacks in order to locate his body.  “Movement vision,”  writes Massumi, “is sight turned proprioceptive” (2002: 59).
