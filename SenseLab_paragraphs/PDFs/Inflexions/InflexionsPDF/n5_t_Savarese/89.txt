“There  is nothing but relation,” writes  Manning. “And  this is what  often makes  it difficult    to   interact  in   the   form   most   associated  with    contained  selves. Containment is not in and  of her experience, and  she cannot easily subtract from the  hyper-relation  of  her  synesthetic  and   cross-modal  experience  to  present herself  as a unified verbal  self” (2009b: 40).
