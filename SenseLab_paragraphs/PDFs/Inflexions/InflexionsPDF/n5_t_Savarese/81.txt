Bissonnette’s metaphors usefully condense movement and  communication, allowing us to see why  typing independently—which, again,  he has  learned to do  but  for intermittent touch  on  his back  or shoulder—is so difficult.  Asked  to comment on  a video  about  independent typing, he  declares, “At  Cannes Film Festival  it should win  award for documentary of tension between affirmation of mental  capacity and   pain   of  physical production  of  language”  (Bissonnette, n.d.a.).   These   tropes  of   communication  emerge  from   Bissonnette’s   bodily encounter with  the world. “Sock sand  racing  into vast beach  of expression is not totally  accident free” (Bissonnette, n.d.a.),  he explains.  The absence  of shoes,  the shifting resistance of the  sand—each defamiliarizes walking. The figure  reveals how  clumsy communicative cognition can  be.  The  beach  awaits, but  the  body interferes. It also shows  what  facilitation contributes: precisely the  resistance of the  sand,  the  tactile  input--maybe even  those  socks,  which  encase  the  feet  and provide their own feedback.
