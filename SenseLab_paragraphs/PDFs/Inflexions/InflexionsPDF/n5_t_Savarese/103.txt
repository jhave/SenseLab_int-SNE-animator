Elsewhere, I have  proposed that  poetry might   constitute a  linguistic meeting point  for different neurological types:  one that  honors both  the “unlost instinct” (or   pure    sensory  knowing)  of   autistics  and    the   symbolic  proclivities   of neurotypicals  (Savarese   2011).  The  sensual splendor  of  the  world,  to  which classical  autistics are  so  attentive, shows   up  by  analogy in  poetry. Patterned syntax  and  sound, pulsating rhythm, emotional prosody as a function of tone— these things might  induce non-literate autistics to grapple with  poetry’s semantic content and,  thus,  functional language in general. In turn,  neurotypicals might  be restored to their  sensing bodies  and,  as a result,  better  understand the  sensory world of autistics. Each half of the neurological divide would commit itself to an ethic of neuro-cosmopolitanism. Each would concede the need  for repair.
