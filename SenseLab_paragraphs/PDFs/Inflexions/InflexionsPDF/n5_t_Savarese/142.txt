[17] In How Can I Talk If My Lips Don’t Move, Mukhopadhyay writes  of learning how  to put  a puzzle together by  privately reciting a verse  in his  head:  “I was getting a kind  of rhythm to the whole  operation. As if in my mind someone was reciting  the  words,  ‘Break  them   up/There  we  go,/One,  two,   three, and…four,/Put them  back/Place by place,/One, two, three,  and…FOUR!’ My fingers  were  timed to the  word ‘four.’  As I timed my  action  to the  rhythm, it seemed to get more  and  more  easy.  My hands began  to be sure  of the fact that  I could  pick up the fourth piece at the prompt, ‘four.’ …I recited the mental verse over and  over again,  as my hands followed the beat” (2008: 149).
