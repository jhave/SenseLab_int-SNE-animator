Put  simply, “pure  vision  is  visual   chaos”   (Massumi  2002:  146),  as  the  more formal  Ganzfeld experiments made  clear.   Even  with  the  controlled stimulation of the other  senses,  when the eyes were  deprived of both  an object and  a context, a  “complete  absence   of  seeing”  (Massumi  2002:  145)  resulted  —what   one participant  termed  “levels    of   nothingness”  (146)   and    what    a   researcher described, interestingly enough, as  akin  to  a  high-altitude flight  in  which   all sense   of  positionality  is  lost.  Any   number  of  the   participants  hallucinated.
