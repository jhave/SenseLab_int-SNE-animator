Bissonnette needs  Felicia to facilitate  understanding, for the world lacks sensitive interpreters  of  autistic  language.    This   is  so  even   when  he   types,   as  the commentary on  the  painting makes  clear:  “Larry’s  somewhat bastardization of English  language puts  friends in the  role  of interpreters extraordinaire” (Biklen
2005: 175). As a kind  of blurred distinction and  the primary form of the painter’s linguistic  liberty,   metaphor,  we   might   say,   is  visually  impaired;   however insightful, it requires a guide dog  to see literally. The implications of the  trope are  deeply ironic  because Bissonnette is so visual  and  because he just might  be remembering language as shapes.
