But  even  this  is  too  simple,   for  the  facilitation  is  itself  dynamic and   multi- sensory:  more  like an  air-traffic  controller whose  fundamental contact  or radio transmission  is  touch.   The   “sock   sand”  figure   resonates  with   that   of  the “potholder”: both  imply  a mediating force  that  materializes form  and  grounds cognition. It might  be profitable to conceive  of the facilitating relationship as an affective  glove  or  hug—even the  OT’s  deep-pressure “hamburger” with  mats. [12] In short,  a tactilely  elicited  “alliance.” Temple  Grandin has  said  famously that her hug machine causes  her to feel more social (Grandin 1991). If we are sufficiently agile  in our  thinking, we  may  posit  touch  as an  organizing force  in both  the body  and  mind, with  language, too, requiring a kind  of deep  pressure.
