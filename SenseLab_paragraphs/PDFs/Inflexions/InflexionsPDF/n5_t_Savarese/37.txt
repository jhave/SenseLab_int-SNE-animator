names of letters,  the  study hypothesized a problem in the  autistic group with complex reasoning, and  it attributed this  problem to  additional differences in activation patterns.  Autistics used  the posterior parts  of the brain,  which  work  to perceive details, while  non-autistics used  the anterior parts,  which  enable  higher- level thinking. Underconnectivity in autistic brains,  the study proposed, makes  it difficult  to  see  the  proverbial forest  for  the  trees,  though the  individual trees might  be seen quite  well—indeed, better  than  when neurotypicals observe them. In this  way,  the  study recommended therapies that  strive  for greater synchrony across multiple brain  regions by stressing problem-solving activities and  creative thinking. [9] Plasticity is the key concept:  the study’s authors believe  that  autistic brains  might  very well become  more  connected.
