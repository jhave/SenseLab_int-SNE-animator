The   difference  between  dream,  experimentally  induced hallucination, and  pathological hallucination from  each  other  and from  “natural” perception pertains to the  kind  and  complexity of experience’s self-referencing to its own ongoing event.  The more impoverished  the   conditions  for  feedback-enabled  cross- referencing, the flightier will be the creative addition of the more  to reality.  The  danger is that,  through insufficient cross-referencing, experience might  overreach its own lifeboat  (Massumi 2002: 156).
