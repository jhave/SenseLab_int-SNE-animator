I have even suggested that metrical poetry, like painting, might  not only calm the anxiety  of classical  autism but also aid in the mastery of complex motor  tasks.  In an interview with  me, Mukhopadhyay all but says that William Blake taught him how  to  tie  his  shoes  (Savarese   2010a).  Mapping the  rhythm of  a Blake  poem around his hands, he coaxed  his fingers  to execute  the necessary movements. [17] The  meter’s  regular  pulse   offered   an   enabling  continuum—what  Manning, speaking of Baggs,  calls  “a  rhythmic reinvention of the  environment’s  sensory dimensions” (2009a: 214).  Gabrielle Starr  notes  that  poetic  rhythm activates the motor   cortex;  hearing it  not  only  makes  us  want  to  move,  but  it  also  has  us unconsciously  simulating  movement.  Perhaps  with   rhythmic  verse Mukhopadhyay found a way  around the  problem of mirror neuron and  basal ganglia  dysfunction  in  autism.  As  important,  Starr   has   shown  that   poetry pursues  what   she   calls  “multisensory  imagery,”  imagery  that   purposefully exploits  the  synesthetic (or relational) foundation of the  senses.   Freed  from  its narrow service  as  an  effete  art  form,  poetry thus  rediscovers a larger  vitality, moving Mukhopadhyay in every  sense  of the  word. As it coaxes  neurotypicals back  into  sensory  experience,  so  it  coaxes  classical   autistics into  more   fluid motion and  what  my son calls “easy breathing.”
