Although he asserts  in My Classic Life that  the “role  of art is to prepare thoughts visually in a way  that  language clearly  can’t articulate,” Bissonnette doesn’t by any  means  abandon the  former for  the  latter.  Again,  he  establishes a relation through analogy. Consider the  title  of another painting: “Plenty of art very  like modern man doesn’t stress  high issues  of morality so praise  me for telling  stories shining colorfully over northern skies”  (Biklen 2005: 176). The implied metaphor invites  us  to  imagine painting as  a way  of “telling stories” and,  further, such storytelling  as  shining like  the  sun  in  his  paintings’  skies.  The  tendency to compare words to images  and  images  to words in deeply figurative formulations is so prevalent in Bissonnette’s writing that  it almost  seems  neurologically overdetermined—beyond how  a non-autistic painter might  instinctively use  art as  a constant referent or  Bissonnette’s  own  desire  to  demonstrate his  literacy. How  to understand this?  If synesthesia is the  processing of one  sense  through another, then  we might  try to conceive  of synesthetic media, or the processing of one  medium through another—in this  case,  images   through words and   vice versa.  Picture, if you will, the cross-wired body  of the arts, where regions of “the brain” ordinarily devoted to  a particular function actually perform a different one, transforming each in the process.
