Metaphor is no literary decoration, as Lakoff and  Johnson have famously pointed out.  Edelman has  suggested that  our  brains,   as  selectional systems,  “operate prima facie  not  by  logic  but  rather by  pattern  recognition…. It  is  likely,  for example, that  early  human thought proceeded by metaphor, which,  even  with the  late  acquisition of precise  means  such  as  logic  and  mathematical thought, continues to be a major  source  of imagination and  creativity in adult life” (2007:
58). Such  pattern making obviously employed the  senses,  and  it is as if in the person of Bissonnette we can observe this “early” form  of thinking in every  day life  (as  opposed  to  the  specific  context   of  a  poem),   along   with   later,   more advanced cognition.
