And  in  what   neurotypical discourse do  the  senses  most  seem  to  “tremble”? Poetry,  of course.  Any  number of scholars has  noted that  autistics seem  to  be writing in a medium akin  to poetry (even  as others  continue to promulgate the notion that  they  can’t process figurative language at all).
