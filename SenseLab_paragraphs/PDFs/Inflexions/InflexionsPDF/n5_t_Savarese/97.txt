The  interaction of the  basal  ganglia with  the  motor,  sensory, and prefrontal  areas   of  the   cortex   may   have   led   to  a  generalized capability of detecting sensorimotor sequences, a kind  of “basal syntax.” Were that the case, a syntax-based true  language may have arisen  as an invention based  on these  already evolved capabilities (2007: 61).
