Because   in  autism  the  natural  evolution  of  a  “basal   syntax”  is  rendered  a strenuous achievement, [14] we  can see not  just the  motoric prerequisite of our own   thought  and   language  use  but   also  its  ongoing  participation  in  these ostensibly  abstract  activities. At  one  point   in  The  Five Senses,  Michel   Serres laments the lack of a “trampolinian upbringing” and  then,  with  lyrical  panache, describes two  acrobats twirling relationally while  chatting in  the  air.  “This  is where speech  comes  from”  (2009: 317), he  exclaims,  unaware of the  extent  to which  the  trampoline figures  therapeutically in the  lives  of many  with  autism. And  unaware, as I will attempt to demonstrate, of how  classical  autistics answer his  call to reinvigorate human cognition. Those  who  have  been  taught to read and  to type  subvert the  “catastrophe of perception” that  is the  “triumph of the written word” (Serres  2009: 252) by “form[ing] their  words through the  senses” (192),  by  putting  their   often   struggling  and   disconnected  bodies   back   into language. As Serres  contends, “The  writer who  merely goes  for  meaning does nothing but  calculate;  he can only  be said  to write  when all the  senses  tremble within the  flesh  of language, semi-soft, a double variety for sight,  touch,  smell and  taste”  (2009: 128).
