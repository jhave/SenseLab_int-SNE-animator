Bissonnette’s subjects  are blinded by the flash—their vision  fails, and  their  faces generally record the  discomfort of sensory overload. (Felicia,  in contrast, seems perfectly calm.) Giving  neurotypicals an idea of what  autism is sometimes like— it can also be “rapturous”--Bissonnette introduces “petrified” verisimilitude into an arena  “stimulated…by intuitions of plentiful feelings  and  sensations” (Biklen
2005: 182). The real—one might  even say, the literal-- is knocked off its proverbial horse;  no longer  sensorially certain,  it strains to gallop.  In its place, the figurative or relational reigns. [11] If Felicia is the “seeing” eye friend  of autistic (or metaphorical)  language,  then   the  painting, which   incorporates this  language along  with  “petrified” verisimilitude, is the  “seeing eye friend” of neurotypical perception, which  must  be tutored in autistic sensing and  knowing--which must be guided into and  through a space of neurodiversity.
