Bissonnette’s   writing  can   be   thought  of   as   heading  toward  the   ideal   of undirected, sensuous painting. It constitutes a kind  of compromise, where language, particularly metaphor, is a typed massage (and/or  typoed message). The product of a necessary corporeal “alliance,” it enables  purposeful, effortless movement. Although Bissonnette’s words aren’t actually concrete, they  feel that way because they  preserve the tactile prompt that  makes  multi-sensorial delight, not  to  mention  the  paintings  themselves,  possible. As  Anne   Donnellan  and others  point  out, classical  autistics have  trouble staging the customary relation of the senses  and  body  parts,  which  must  subtly  cooperate to produce the seamless integrity  of  neurotypical  functioning  (Donnellan, Hill,  and   Leary   2010).  The tricks that autistics employ to compensate—touching something to make sight useable,  for   example—reveal  the   necessary  relation:   there   are   no   discrete faculties.   As  the  drive   to  pattern links  distinct entities through  a  process of visual,  auditory or olfactory comparison, the  equivalent shows  up  in language through the  practice of touch-based typing. Touch  literally coordinates thought, and  not just any kind  of thought: rather, sensuous, relational thought.  No doubt the process is fueled  by significant right-hemispheric activity,  and  no doubt Bissonnette  attempts  to  reproduce  the  visual   as  language.  Here,   Manning’s notion of “relationscape” seems  particularly relevant, as analogy demarcates an alternative space of movement (Manning 2009a). [8] Word,  image,  person, object, environment—each is  reconfigured by  the  principle of  dynamic interconnectedness.  If,  as  Manning  argues  with   respect  to  Amanda  Baggs, atypical sensory processing in  autism helps  to  produce a  “leaky” self—a  self more  open  to relation--than metaphor is that self’s leaky language.
