Although we have  naturalized the motion of our hands, believing it to be simply an expression of will, the senses,  as both a force in the present and  a remembered force  from  the  past,  facilitate  such  an  action.  Dynamic relationality over  time gives  birth   to  a  subject  who  more  than   a  bit  arrogantly  declares himself   an individual, forgetting the radical  relationscape of his very own  sensing body  and its palpable dependency on the physical world.
