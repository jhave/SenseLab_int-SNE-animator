In this  way,  according to Cartwright, “communication comes  into  play  relative to…autism both  as  problematic and  as  a  potential source   of  management or tutoring in subjectivity”  (2008: 222). For  Cartwright, FC helps  to instill  a body image,  which,  Silvan  Tomkins argues, “appears to be primarily constituted of a set  of  kinesthetic and  vestibular messages” (Quoted in  Cartwright 2008: 255). Dynamic incorporeity arrives through  affective  touch:  “a  kind  of  feeling  that comes   together  across   the   senses   and   between  subjects,   leaving  behind  a structural memory, a pathway through which  a subject  may  anticipate the touch of an other” (Cartwright 2008: 220). Here  Cartwright complicates the movement- sensation  model,  adding   the    crucial    element—indeed,   the    motivator—of awakened sociality  or differentiated communication. Once exposed to such communication, the  person with  autism propels him  or herself  into  the  future, desirous of this narrower field  of relation, this more  typical  pulse  of connection. Or  at  least  he  or  she  is  now  pulled in  two  directions. In  the  section  entitled “Striving Toward  Independent  Articulation of  Personal  Thoughts”  from   his “West    Coast    Symposium”   presentation,   Bissonnette  underscores   the   link between sensorimotor remediation and  affective  sustenance, which  ideally  end up   fused   in  the   act  of  facilitation.  “Learning  and   understanding  properly supplied support only  starts  with  people practicing synthesis of emotional and physical  support  issued  separately  but   roasted  together  on  fire  of communication,” he says (Bissonnette 2001b).
