In  addition to  mono-processing,  many   classical   autistics resort   to  a  kind   of sensory compensation, where the various modalities are called upon to do things for which  they are not primarily suited, in order to combat  dysfunction. As Bogdashina puts  it, when autistic people “have  visual  problems, they  use  their ears,   nose,   tongue  or  hand  to  ‘see’—they  compensate  for   their   temporary
‘blindness’ through other  senses.  Thus,  a child  may  tap  an object to produce the sound and  recognizes what  it is…. Some  children smell  people and  objects  to identify  them”  (2004:  84).  What   if  that   pilot-scientist  had   to   use   his   ass exclusively to see?   Could he learn  to do it? What might  flying, then,  be like? Bogdashina reminds us  that  a majority of autistics finds  smell  and  touch  more reliable;  these  senses  tend  to  be  their  compensatory ones.  As an  example, she relates  the story  of Alex, which  I quote  in full because it is so evocative—indeed, it   reveals    a   way   in   which    neuro-atypicality  might   be   a   potential  poetic advantage.
