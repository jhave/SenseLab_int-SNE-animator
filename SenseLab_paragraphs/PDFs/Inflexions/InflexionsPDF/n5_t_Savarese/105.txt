If, as Manning argues, the first half of “In My Language” “transforms space  into an ambient musical instrument that  moves  in a dance  of rhythmical becomings” (2009a: 213), if according to Baggs it offers “not…words or even  visual  symbols for people to interpret [but]  is about  being  in a constant conversation with  every aspect  of my  environment, reacting physically to all parts  of my  surroundings” (2009a: 215), then  Bissonnette’s linguistic output—autie-type in general--might be conceived of as the reconciled halves  of Baggs’ famous YouTube,  or even the fulfillment  of  Serres’   insistence  on   the   “flesh   of  language.”  “There   is  no question,”   writes    Manning   of   the   video’s   translated   second   half,   “that articulation through language is capable of conveying a certain  complexity, bridging the worlds of sensory eventness with  the affective  tonality of language in the  making such  that  a dialogue between these  co-arising worlds can begin” (2009a: 214). In the  passage already quoted from  Bissonnette—“March with  me. You’ll have promising strides of valiant, creating great  havoc with  nearly perfect, brushstrokes to inspire you”—metaphor is that reconciliation. It is perceptual language  in-the-making:   the   eye,   ear,   nose,   skin,   and   proprioception  gone marching, quite  literally on the move.
