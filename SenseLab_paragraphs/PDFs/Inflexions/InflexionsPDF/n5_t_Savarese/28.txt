Nasty residential better  for growing vegetables rather than  people, Brandon Training School. No one  should limit  learning of truth in life to closed rooms  occupied only by people with  no natural means to communicate. Going  back  in desolation where it’s only  me and letterless walls is not pleasant to think  about.  Nothing “apartheids” you  like the  insensitive world of institutional existence  (My Classic Life 2005).
