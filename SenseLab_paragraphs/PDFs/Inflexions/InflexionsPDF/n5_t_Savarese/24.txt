In a work  entitled “Paints Get Really  Loused Up  By My Signature So Both Art and  Letters  Learn  to Cohabitate,” Bissonnette presents a rectangular canvas  of reds,  purples, pinks   and  blues.  The  painting is  largely   abstract, and  running through the middle of it, from left to right,  appears the artist’s name—Larry John
Bissonnette—in large, white,  painted letters.
