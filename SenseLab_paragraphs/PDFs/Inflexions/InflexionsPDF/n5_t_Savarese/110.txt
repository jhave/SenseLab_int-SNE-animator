asserts  a common life that  is experienced in the  body  of one  who makes  it, and  the  separation is only  present at the  linguistic level. Our  sense  of  the  commonality of  the  two  ideas,   perceptions or entities does  not lie in a post hoc derivation of something abstracted from each of them,  which  is found on subsequent comparison to be similar,   or  even  one  and  the  same  thing;  but  rather on  a  single concrete, kinaesthetic  experience  more   fundamental  than   either, and  from which  they  in turn  are derived. Thus a clash of arguments and  a clash  of cymbals are not seen  to have  something in common only  after  the disembodied idea  of a “clash”  is abstracted from  the one and  from the other,  and  found—aha!—to be similar;  it is rather that  these  experiences…are felt in our embodied selves as sharing a common nature (2010: 117).
