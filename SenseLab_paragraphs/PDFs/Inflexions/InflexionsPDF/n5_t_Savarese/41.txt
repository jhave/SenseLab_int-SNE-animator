A synesthetic approach to Bissonnette’s work  finds support in a painting entitled “Seeing  Eye Friend  Felicia in Gathering of My Very  Canned Together Speech.” The guide dog  trope  presents hearing as vision:  Felicia  “gathers” Bissonnette’s echolalic  speech,  which  “comes  down [his]  pipes  like  a pre-programmed train that  is way  off its itinerary” (My  Classic Life 2005), and  translates it. The  word “gathers” not only renders speech  more  concrete than  it is, but it also evokes  the force  of proprioception, as words, like  muscles, “develop an  alliance”—that is,
become  usefully organized and  thereby “move  freely.”
