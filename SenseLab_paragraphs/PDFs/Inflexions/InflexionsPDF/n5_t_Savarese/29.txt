While the “letterless walls”  function here as a figure  for imposed illiteracy, walls generally  function  in  Bissonnette’s  writing  as  screens   upon  which   a  more humane future can  be written or painted and  upon which  the  imagination can “elevate [things] to their  artistic  potential” (My Classic Life 2005). One painting’s title suggests, for example, that  “massively added on with  tons of entirely empty of  people windows  looks  less  imposing if  walls  are  painted in  papal reds” (Biklen 2005: 177). In a piece  called  “Shift and  Changes in My Life,” Bissonnette notes,   “It’s  ever   so  easy  to  paper walls   with   ambitious words  but  the  real difference in clearing Larry’s needs  has been the wonderful, caring,  less worried about  Larry  weirdnesses and  more  attuned to his potential, people who  support him  everyday.” Notice  the  conflation of art and  typed communication, as if the latter,  too,  might  be  framed and  hung. Though he  focuses  on  people and  not words in this statement, what  comes across is the dedicated community in which literacy,  an essential marker for intelligence, can arise.
