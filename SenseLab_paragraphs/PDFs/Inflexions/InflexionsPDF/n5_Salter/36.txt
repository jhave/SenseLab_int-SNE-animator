Simondon points out that  one cannot understand the processes of being from the point  of view of a system of stable equilibrium. “Stable equilibrium excludes becoming, because it corresponds to the lowest  possible level of potential energy; it is the equilibrium that  is reached in a system when all of the possible transformations have  been  realized and  no more  force  exists”  (Simondon 1980:
302). Because  all potential has  been  actualized in the  system, the  system can no longer   enter   new  states   or  transformations.  In  other   words, the  potential or “virtuality” that  Simondon describes is drained from  the  system because it has settled down into  a steady state.  Similarly,  the  same  principles of metastability operate in  living  systems (domaine du  vivant).  A  living  system does  not  only modify its relations based  on  the  environment (as in the  case  of a homeostatic system), but  more  importantly, also  modifies itself  “through the  invention of new  internal structures and  its complete self-insertion into the axiomatic of vital problems” (305). Simondon’s  use  of the  word transduction  therefore announces how  the processes of physical, technical, vital and  psycho-social ontogenesis rely on  metastability (or  “fictional stability”)  as  the  mode   by  which   and  through which  the  operation of individuation takes  place.  Propagating through phases, each  being  carries  with  it the  metastable potential to suddenly have  ruptures in its phases of individuation; to “dephase itself in relation to itself” by breaking its fictionally stable equilibrium and  engaging in processes that are carried with  and
