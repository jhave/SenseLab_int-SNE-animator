This question of scale leads  to a second quandary. Given  Simondon’s explicit analyses of established and  concretized mechanical and  analog  component technologies such  as cathode ray  tubes  and  Guimbal turbines, can we  consider more   heterogeneous  environments  like  JND  as  technical  objects   in  and   of themselves?  The  answer I  would venture is  yes,  because like  the  associated milieu  of  water and  pipes   that  the  Guimbal turbine needs   to  operate in,  the technical object of JND is concretized by means  of its performance within its specified milieu  - a milieu  that  may  be more  heterogeneous than  Simondon at first allows  for. What  about  in the case of JND in which  the human participant or “operator”  also  becomes   an  integral  part   of  the  associated  milieu’s natural/technical makeup or what  Bernard Stiegler  labels  “human geography”? Does the presence of such  “human geography” as part  of the milieu  bring  about a further complexifying of the dynamics of a technical object’s evolution or what Simondon will later term in the biological sense of the word, ontogenesis?
