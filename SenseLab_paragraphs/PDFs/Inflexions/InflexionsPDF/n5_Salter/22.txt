As a technical individual,  the  sensor  needs  an  associated milieu  comprised of forces to jar the mass and  set the spring into motion in order to produce a change of  electrical   voltage.  These   forces  in  the  milieu   then   may   exhibit   recurrent causality by acting  back  based  on the  response the  sensor  generates within the media in  the  environment. But,  we  could  also  change scale  and  say  that  the PCBâ€™s themselves should be considered as technical elements that  depend on the individualization of other  technical elements to form  an associated milieu.  Such is the structure of the technical objects that comprise JND.
