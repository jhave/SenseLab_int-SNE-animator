Does this schema of scales that  Simondon suggests, however, provide a method to  understand the  recurrent loops  of interaction that  take  place  in  a complex work  like JND? In the  installation, the  technical “individuals” of paper sensors, wireless PCB’s,  acoustic   actuators, computers, audio I/O  devices,   LED’s  and their  power supplies and  controllers and  DMX protocol translators mutually establish what  Simondon labels  “recurrent causality” (essentially, a circular feedback process in a system in which  individual elements are coupled to or “entrained” with  each  other)  within a complex associated milieu  comprised of architectural structures produced  out  of  MDF,  steel  studs,  rock  wool,   nails, hinges  and  screws  and  vital (that is, human) participants. Within  this framework, two questions arise. The first is, at what  perspective can we classify something as a technical individual within a complex system? In analyzing the components of the custom developed wireless sensor  platform used  in JND, we might  say that at one   scale   an   individual  sensor   (an   accelerometer)  attached  to   a   wireless transmission board comprises a technical individual since the sensor  itself is constructed of many  elements, such  as  the  capacitors, resistors, the  suspended mass  and  the  micro-sized spring supporting the  mass  that  are all housed inside the IC (Integrated Circuit).
