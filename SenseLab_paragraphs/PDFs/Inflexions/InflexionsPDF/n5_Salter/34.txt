In Psychic and Collective Individuation,  Simondon argues that  the  very  concept of an individual and  the  process of individuation operates over  different registers: physical, as in the formation of a crystal  from a supersaturated solution and  vital, as  in  the  formation of life.  Such  individuation is only  made  possible through what  is described as metastable states.  Individuation thus  articulates a process by which  the individual is formed over  a series  of states  or, using  the  specific  term from  physics, phases, starting from  a pre-individual state  and  individuating itself through a continual process of metastability. As Simondon argues, “this  division of being  into phases is becoming” (Simondon 1980: 301). Ontogenesis proper constitutes the  process by which  being,  in its becoming, “divides and  dephases itself.”  In  other  words, the  process of  individuation is  marked by  a  break  or rupture in the process of becoming.
