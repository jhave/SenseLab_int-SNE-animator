But  how   does   this  dynamic of  technical individualization  between  technical object  and  milieu   actually function? In  order to  answer this,  we  will  closely examine  Simondon’s  crucial   distinctions  between  the  different  scales  of  the technical object:  element, individual and  ensemble. Technical  elements or  what Simondon labels  “infra-individual technical objects”  (56). include individual components of  machines (like  resistors, oscillating crystals,   voltage regulators and  power supplies) that  have  no associated milieu  in order to function. In other words,  these   components  are   more   or   less   independent  of  each   other   in performing their  specific  functions. On the  other  hand, technical individuals are made   up  of  technical elements  and   comprise more   concretized machines or devices  that are specified tied to an associated milieu.  The final scale of technical ensembles  connects  large   assemblies  of   technical  individuals   together,  for instance, in the environment of a laboratory or factory.  Simondon claims that technical individuals are produced inside  larger  technical ensembles, such  as factories  and  are kept  independent or isolated from  each  other  (“non  connected devices”). Thus,  there  is rarely  the  possibility of such  individuals forming an associated milieu.
