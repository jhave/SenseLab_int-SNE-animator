“The  end  was  almost  unbearable but  in  a really  enjoyable  way”; “With  the  intensity of vibration and  the  light,  I suddenly realized there  was  space”;  “When I first  laid  down, because it was  so,  so dark,  my eyes were  seeing  flashes  of light”;  “I didn’t really  feel the roundness  of  my   body.   It  was   sort,   all   laid   out   like   a  two dimensional shadow on the floor”; “It felt like my stomach was expanding … it was more  like an expansion or leaking of the boundaries of my  body.” “At  one  point,  because it was  so dark,  I felt my  visual  field  collapse  in, almost  on  top  of me.  I closed  my eyes   and   opened  them   again,   but   there   was   no   perceivable difference. Then  I faintly  saw  light  above  and  suddenly realized that my eyes were in fact, closed.”
