From   an   engineering  standpoint,  the   installation  employs  sensors:  sets   of transducers that  convert one  form  of energy (e.g., sound vibration) into  another (electrical  pulses). These  sensors continually pick  up  and  transmit to computers the  changes in  pressure  over   time   (not  absolute  pressureâ€“which  is  why   the statistical technique of variance is employed) produced by the  visitors lying  on their  backs.  The  program  essentially maps  the  variances into  parameters that subsequently drive  sound synthesis algorithms. Since there  are 24 areas  in a 6 by
4 grid  of sensing and  12 speaker outputs, the sensor  data  is combined in order to map  local movements of the body  to local vibrations at specific areas,  such as the head,  feet  or  lower  back.  In  certain  parts,  we  use  a sum  of all  the  changes in pressure in order to shift the over-all  amplitude of the vibration.
