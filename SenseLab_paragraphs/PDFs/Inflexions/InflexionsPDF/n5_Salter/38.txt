Yet, what  is perhaps even more  interesting about  Simondon’s description of transductive processes is that  they  can  cross  different scales  and  modalities of human  and    technical  performances,   not   privileging  one   over   the   other. “Logically,   it  can  be  used   as  the  foundation of  a  new  species   of  analogical paradigms so as to enable  us to pass from  physical individuation to organic individuation, from  organic individuation  to  psychic   individuation and   from psychic  individuation to the subjective and  objective  level of the transindividual
that forms our level of investigation” (314).
