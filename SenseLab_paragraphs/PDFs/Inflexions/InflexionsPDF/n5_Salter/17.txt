In a recent  discussion with  the author concerning the thresholds of perception as material for artistic  work,  philosopher Brian  Massumi described his experience of JND. “JND deals  with  where we think  we are in perceiving…in other  words, to  make   the  work   about   perception  perceiving  itself  and   its  own   limits   is something that  seems  all  encompassing but  requires a minimalist approach, a kind  of subtraction or reduction of perception towards its minimum thresholds and  back  out  towards its maximum envelopment. When  we are talking about  a perception of a perception, it is interesting to often  start  from  this  point  rather than  talking about  objects  and  how  we  perceive the  subject  from  the object…framing  it  in  terms   of  thresholds  interrogates  perception  in  a  very different way.”
