Examining the effects of Simondon’s concept of technical ontogenesis forces us to think  through the very specific material processes entailed in the installation. But just what  is ontogenesis? Psychologist and  developmental systems theory (DST) proponent Susan  Oyama defines ontogenesis as “the inherently orderly yet contingent coming  to being”  (Oyama 2000: 3). In Oyama’s sense,  ontogenesis is deeply historical, signifying a “conditional transformation of prior  structure.” “Depending on the level of analysis, such transformation can be described as resulting from interactions among entities, such as cells or organisms, or from interactions within an  entity,  such  as an  embryo or family”  (3). For Simondon, however, ontogenesis is described as the  general development of a being  or its becoming. “In  other   words, that  which   makes   the  being  develop or  become, insofar  as it is, as being … ontogenesis would be the theory of the phases of being, prior  to objective  knowledge, which  is a relation to be individuated in the milieu, after individuation” (Simondon 1992: 300-301).
