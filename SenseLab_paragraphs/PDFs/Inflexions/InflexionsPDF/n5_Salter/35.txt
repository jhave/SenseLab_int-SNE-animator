In appropriating the term  metastable, Simondon appears to be directly referring to  its  usage   in  physics  to  describe  a  system  that   resides  in  a  precarious, apparently unchanging (i.e., time invariant) equilibrium. Metastable systems can remain in such states  for indefinite periods of time until  some kind  of potentially stochastic shift changes the systemâ€™s dynamics, causing it to immediately change state.   Indeed,  such   stochasticity  is  a  key  factor   in  metastable  behaviors  in electronic,  chemical,    biological  and   geophysical  systems.  For   example,  an avalanche can be considered to exhibit  metastable dynamics in that the formation of  ice  and  snow   on  the  top  of  a  mountain may  appear to  be  stable  but  can immediately change state  if it is perturbed by outside forces, like a skier or loud vibration.
