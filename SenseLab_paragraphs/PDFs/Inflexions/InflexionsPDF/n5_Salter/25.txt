Massumi/author  concerning JND  continued:  “In  a  reduced environment, we start  with  a very  impoverished field  of perception…there isn’t really  very  much to focus  on and  then  very,  very  slowly,  you  start  feeling  indistinct perceptions. You are  not  quite  sure  where it comes  from  but  it hits  you  first  as an  affective feeling-a  kind  of pulsation and  a sense  of anxiety  or  fear  knowing that  there really is no object of anxiety  or fear. So, I found myself  perceiving fear in the lack of any actual  object.”
