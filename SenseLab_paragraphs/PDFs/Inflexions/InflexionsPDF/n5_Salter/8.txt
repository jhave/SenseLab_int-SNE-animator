emotional, like language or passions) modify, operate on and  transform bodies. If  Henri   Bergson   describes  affect  as  the   manner  in  which   external  matter, “images” or perceptions in the world “influence the image  that  I call my body  in that  they  “transmit movement to  it,”  Deleuze and  Guattari later  pick  up  this trajectory, modifying it in the  sense  that  affects  are not  necessarily situated in a subject  (like emotions or feelings  are) but  rather are pre-individual, non-subject centered forces  —“blocs  of percepts” or sensations. If, as Deleuze and  Guattari write,   that  the  artistic   practice is  about   the  production of  such  percepts and affects, then  question we face here might  be summarized as where is the locus of production and  experience for these  blocs of sensation in JND and  how  do they function. But where then  does  Simondon’s  “phenomenology of technology” fit
into this?
