These  feelings  most  likely  are  the  result  of the  first moments in the installation, where extremely short  pulses of vibration under the feet and  low levels  of light  emerging in a line on the ceiling  above  the  reclining visitors  blur   sensory  modalities.  After   three   minutes,  however,  the   sound gradually gives  way  to  the  first  direct  tactile  vibrations-vibrations that  change their  intensity based  on the visitors’ smallest movements and  adjustments while lying  on  their  backs.
