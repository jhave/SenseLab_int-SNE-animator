The implications of Simondon’s model are profound since we now  have to grasp life as ontogenesis: a process rather than  a pre-given substance, form  or object. “Instead of understanding individuation starting from  the  individuated being, the individuated being  must  be understood starting from individuation, and individuation from  pre-individual being,  each  operating at  different orders of magnitude” (Simondon 1980: 311). The individual continues to carry  with  them the traces  of potential and  transformation. JND thus  brings  this process into  the realm  of the  aesthetic, magnifying the  individual as  event  comprised of more
than  one kind  of life.
