Finally,  we  come  to  the  question of what  Simondon’s  ontogenetic framework could  provide to artists  who are crossing, breeding and  mixing  different concepts of  technical  and   human  “performativity.” In  some  ways,   there   are  faint  but salient  resonances between the concept of performativity as a temporal unfolding of  being  and  Simondon’s  overall  framework of allagmatics, an  invented word describing a “theory of operations” which  articulates the  change, exchange of energy and  transformations possible within a particular physico-material- biological system. I should be explicit  in stating that by using  this term “performativity,” I do not mean  linguistic or discursive notions, for instance, like Austin’s notion of speech  acts or Judith  Butler’s gender performativity which involves  a  temporally  bound  system  of   repetitive  iterations  and   citations regulated by discursive practices. Instead, performativity here  describes a time variant process by which  different behaviors, actions  and  patterns of human and non-human expressions are materially constituted in the world and  in so doing, produce specific and tangible material processes and  changes.
