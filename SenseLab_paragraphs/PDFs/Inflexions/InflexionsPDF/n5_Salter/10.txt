One at a time,  the participants enter  into  the 2 m wide  x 4.5 m long  x 3 m high, box-like  structure through a narrow, square door.  Once inside  the total darkness of the architectural shell, they  lie back down on a custom developed floor whose underside is lined  with  twelve  full frequency “tactile  sound” actuators which  are normally used  in commercial or home  cinema  seats to deliver low frequency vibrations. The actuators produce both  audible sound and  vibrations that  vary from the barely  perceivable (the threshold of perception) to extremely intense. Ranging from  fidgeting to larger  body  movements, individual movements from the participants are measured in real time  by a 24 paper based  pressure sensors
