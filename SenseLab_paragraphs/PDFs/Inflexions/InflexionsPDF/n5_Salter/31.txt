are  regulated and  connected such  that  they  form  a greater whole—namely, an organism. This living  matter is not  a blank  slate,  nor  is it purely contingent but rather “that  which  is alive can invent, because whatever is alive is an individual being   that   brings   with   it  its  own   associated  milieu”  (51).  Here,   Simondon analogously describes a notion of “liveness” as a dynamic coming  to be between the   organic  and    technical  within   a   set   of   processes  that    I   describe  as “performative”: that  is, temporally bound due  to recurrent causality or coupling, self-conditioning, in-formation or the active “giving” of form.
