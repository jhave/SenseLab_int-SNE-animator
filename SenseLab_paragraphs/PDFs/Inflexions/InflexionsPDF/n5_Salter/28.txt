and  disappears accompanies this section  of the composition. The visitors feel that they  can actually steer  the intensity of the vibrations based  on where they  move. For example, if they  shift their  feet back and  forth,  they  suddenly feel an intense but  moving vibration that  snakes  from  the  feet up  the  back  of their  body.  This feeling  of direct,  local control  and  influence over the vibration soon gives way to oscillations which  feel uniform across  the  entire  surface  of the  floor—a  sense  of breathing sounds that  rise and  fall in volume, making the visitors’ entire  bodies tingle  and  vibrate and  which  is made  possible by the recurrent causality between the human and  technical.
