The key to this somewhat opaque process is the threshold within the continuum when these  different systems couple  with  each other  to produce something that overrides a notion of individual, already completed being.  As Brian  Massumi states  in a recent  interview entitled “Technical Mentality Revisited,” the moment of invention  within Simondon’s example of the  Guimbal turbine is when sets  of different matter in potentia (to use a phrase from Aristotle) suddenly couple  with each other,  producing “a single continuous system.” “A synergy clicks in. A new “regime of functioning” has  suddenly leapt  into  existence.  A  “threshold” has been  crossed, like a quantum leap  to a qualitatively new  plane  of operation. The operation of the turbine is now  “self-maintaining.” It has achieved a certain operational autonomy, because the  potentials in the  water and  in the  oil have interlinked in such  a way as to automatically regulate the transfer of energy into the turbine and  of heat out of it, allowing the turbine to continue functioning independently without the  intervention of an  outside operator to run  or repair it” (Massumi 2009: 39).
