Using JND, I want  here to explore  the consequences of Simondon’s concept of technical ontogenesis, the concretization of a technical object in relation to its associated milieu,  as a way  of confronting the specific  material processes taking place between technologies and  their  environments. In taking  JND as a complex, hybrid technical object, we may extend Simondon’s understanding of the various scales  of  technical individuals  in  order to  grasp how   his  radical   attempt to establish a continuity between technical, biological and  psycho-social processes of individuation makes  sense  in an era  of contemporary artistic  practice where pre-personal affects (i.e., forces) and  agencies  are increasingly distributed across different registers of “life” (biological and technical).
