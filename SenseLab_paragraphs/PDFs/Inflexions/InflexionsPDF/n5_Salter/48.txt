We cannot know individuation  in the  common sense  of the  phrase; we  can  only  individuate, individuate ourselves and  in  ourselves. On the margins of knowledge proper, this comprehension is an analogy between two processes, which  is a specific mode  of communication. Individuation of the  reality  beyond the  subject  as grasped by the subject  thanks to the analogous individuation of knowledge within the subject.  But it is by means of the individuation of knowledge and  not  knowledge along  that  the  individuation of beings  that  are  not  subjects  is grasped. Beings  can  be  known by means   of  the  knowledge of the  subject,  but  the  individuation of beings  cannot be understood except by the individuation of the knowledge of the subject (Simondon 1980: 317).
