As an artistic  experience, JND grapples with  what  it means to interact and individualize over  different perceptual thresholds within a milieu.  Interaction within the box takes place despite the fact that such thresholds of bodily  initiated motions and   their   reciprocal responses  create   a  gap  in  perception in  which stimuli from  inside  the  JND environment may not actually be directly (that is, physically) felt by an individual body all of the time. In fact, one of the chief reasons why  sensing technologies are used  to analyze movements (but  not record them) from  participants is in order to produce a set of intertwined relations between human and  technical action.  At  times,  the  visitors feel  in direct  control  of the environment. Consequently, they  may  be aware that  hardly noticeable fidgeting and   barely   perceived movements  result   in  some  kind   of  response  or  action directly at the bodily  level. At other  times,  however, the visitorsâ€™ motion returns no  direct   feedback  from   the   environment.  Instead,  one   feels  the   apparatus performing for and  with  itself.
