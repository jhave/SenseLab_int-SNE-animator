With  the  coupling between disparate  systems, something fundamentally  new takes  place  where different processes of individuation blur  into  a continuum. Within  these  thresholds, a coupling between human and  technical actions reciprocally produces  the  phase  changes that   Simondon  articulates.  What   is more,  these  gaps  provide the key to ontogenesis. Continually and  over  time,  the process of phasing and  dephasing enable  the pre-individual reservoir’s excess to leak  out.   If  aspects  of  the  pre-individual  always are  ever   present  in  these dephased  breaks   that   are   just   noticeable,  then   we   are   brought  back   to  a fundamental  question  that   arises   due   to   Simondon’s   conceptualization  of technical-vital individuation: what  does  it mean  for our  experience of the world to have  perceptions that  consist  of continuities only to be broken by gaps?  What does it signify for perception as part  of the process of individuation to not ‘know’ or  recognize  these  moments of  “falling   out  of  phase” -  these  pre-individual eruptions in the intertwined process of individuation?
