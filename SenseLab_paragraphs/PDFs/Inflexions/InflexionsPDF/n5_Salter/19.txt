In the contemporary cultural Zeitgeist, artists,  designers and  architects are increasingly  focused  on   the   ecological,   that   is,   the   systemic  dynamics  of interaction in technical-vital systems and  processes in order to achieve  what Simondon labels  “concretization.” Concretization describes how  “abstract” technical schemas come  to  be  operational:  materially conditioned and  realized into concrete technical objects in the world by way of their  creation of “an environment that  had  merely virtual existence  before  the  invention” (Simondon
1980: 58). The relationship between the object and  the environment, what Simondon’s   terms   the   “associated  milieu,”  is  one   of  mutual  or   reciprocal dependence and  interaction—“an environment which  it influences and  by which it is influenced” (61). The associated milieu  is not  pre-given as in an existing,  a priori schema or representation, but  arises  in the  operation or performance of an object and its environment in a dynamic relation with  one another.
