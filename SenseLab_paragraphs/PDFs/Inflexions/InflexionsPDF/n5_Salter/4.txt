What  can Gilbert  Simondon’s philosophy of technical individuation offer contemporary  artistic   practice involving  new   technics?   What   spatio-temporal scales  are  at  work   in  the  evolution of  technical objects  used   in  art  making? Finally,  and  perhaps more  urgently, what  are  the  perceptual/affective consequences of Simondon’s  ontogenetic understanding  of technical, physical, vital  and  psychic-social individuation  that  increasingly plays  itself  out  in contemporary artworks that  blur  the  supposed boundaries between the  living and  the non-living?
