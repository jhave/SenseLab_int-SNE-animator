But there can be no question here of a mathematical instant. No doubt there is an ideal present – a pure conception, the indivisible limit which separates past from future. But the real, concrete, live present – that of which I speak when I speak of my present perception – that present necessarily occupies a duration. Where then is this duration placed? […] Quite evidently, […] what I call ‘my present’ has one foot in my past and another in my future (Bergson 137-138).
