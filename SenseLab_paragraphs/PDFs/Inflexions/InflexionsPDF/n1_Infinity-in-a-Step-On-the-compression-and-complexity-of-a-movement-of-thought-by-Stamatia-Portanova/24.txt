The third way in which infinity is conceived by the monadâ€™s thought is therefore through the definition of qualities, a definition which is mathematically expressed by Leibniz through differential calculus, i.e. the calculation of the limit between two series that are always convergent and that tend infinitely towards a limit. A branch of mathematics created by Leibniz, calculus deals with almost infinite and infinitesimal quantities, as an approximate calculation of the rate of change of one quality in relation to the rate of change of another one in one instant of time (such as the instantaneous speed of a body, as the derivative of distance in relation to time). Transduced into philosophical terms, this mathematical operation shows the way in which the monad/soul  can  consciously  perceive  (or  calculate)  the  infinite  qualitative  gradations  of  a  body,  every quality being delimited by infinitely stretchable limits and being designated by differential relations (or degrees).
