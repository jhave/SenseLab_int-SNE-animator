Being a philosopher-mathematician, Leibniz associates the compressive thought of the monad/soul with three mathematical operations. The first one is the creation of the infinite series of prime numbers, philosophically intended as a series of absolute identities, each reducing infinity to one whole entity (1, 3, 5,
7 … ). The second operation is the conception of ‘definables’, i.e. of all those notions that are derived from primary principles and work according to an infinite combinatory logic of wholes and parts (4 = 2x2 or 8:2, and also 3 and 1 entering a particular relation +) (52). Together with its [de]composability into wholes and parts, a body also possesses different qualities (such as the speed of a moving body), each one of these qualities constituting a series converging towards a limit (such as the infinite degrees of speed): ‘Parts or wholes do not exist any more; they are replaced by degrees for each character’ (54).
