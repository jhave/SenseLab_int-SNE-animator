mind’, and by Bergson as the work of ‘consciousness’: thought always implies a relation, an improvised contact or a relational embrace, more than a monadic waltz, between the subject and its own past-future self. It is not only a plurality of thinking subjects, therefore, but the plurality of one subject which is synthesised out of multiple occasions, transforming thought into an already relational creative act. Following Bergson’s philosophy of time, we understand thought as the temporal compression of a multiplicity of moments (or occasions) in the elastic duration of the present. At the same time, a continuous becoming of the present into past and future weaves the linear continuity from which a subjective consciousness emerges as an after- effect of thought.
