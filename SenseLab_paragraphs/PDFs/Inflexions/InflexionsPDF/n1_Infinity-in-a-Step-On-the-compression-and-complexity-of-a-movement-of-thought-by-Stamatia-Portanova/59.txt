whole surface, rather than making movement depend on a central point (consciousness) preceding and directing it according to physical and gravitational laws. In this sense, the thought of movement coincides with a movement of thought. Rather than being abstractly separated and antecedent to the moving body, thought coincides with movement in the critical moment of its appearance (or of its sensation). While a body is consciously moving, it is also always imperceptibly, rhythmically thinking. A thought is in other words in- corporeal, a bodily creation emerging between sensation and movement: a jump of the body as the solid,
balanced expression of a movement of thought.
