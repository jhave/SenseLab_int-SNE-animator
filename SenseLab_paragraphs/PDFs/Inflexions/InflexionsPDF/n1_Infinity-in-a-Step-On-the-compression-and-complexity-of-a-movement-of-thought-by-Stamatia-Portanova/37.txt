also it is one among the disjunctive ‘many’ which it leaves; it is a novel entity, disjunctive among the many entities which it synthesizes. The many become one, and are increased by one’ (Whitehead 1978, 21). This prehensive collaboration does not need any sort of control or surveillance form the outside (as was the case with the monad’s dominating character and with its need of a further divine presence); rather, it is the result of an ontogenetic material tendency towards aggregation. Compression (as a synthesis of the many into the One) acquires here a new sense: it becomes a togetherness, or a relationality, as the main aspect of creation, i.e.  the condition through  which  novelty  can only  emerge  in  a  compressed  affective  collaboration,  or  a
‘concrescence’ (literally, growing together). An individual subject does not pre-exist but coalesces, or is drawn together, from different prehensions, i.e. from different affective responses between an internal and an external environment. The alternation of subjective compositions and decompositions, and the different affective gradations between different occasions of experience constitute an ontogenetic tendency of matter, a force of cohesion attracting different elements into a persisting whole while, at the same time, leaving the process open to the influence of other forces and other elements. In this sense, subjectivity dissolves into a continuous process of subjectivation, a synthetic contraction of different prehensions in one single moment, and a linear continuity between different occasions in time.
