Nora Heilmann’s Blindspot is a live improvised performance progressively taking form as the spatial explorations and the sensations of the performer develop themselves in the duration of twenty minutes. There is no music and the dancer is blindfolded. The start is given by the dancer’s orientation and feeling of space: after leaning against the wall, he takes a few steps running, followed by a few, quick movements of the legs. The whole performance is catalysed by his sensations. In the moving body, sensations are registered by the nervous system which, contracting many vibrations into one instant, synthesizes the body’s immediate past: the multiple vibrations and frequencies transmitted by an apparently static wall, for example, are condensed into an instantaneous sensation of solidity. We could say that, in sensation, the body moves with the wall. In other words, the dancer is already moving before taking the first step. The vibratory, synthetic nature of Pierre’s sensations makes his body pass through different phases, or fields, in one moment: it is therefore possible to distinguish the different orders of one sensation, because every single sensation is already  an  accumulation,  a  coagulation,  a  synthesis  of  different  levels,  corresponding  to  the  different qualities of the wall (temperature, consistency, texture, etc). Transduced into the phenomenology of perception, the passage of the body between different qualities in a unique sensation coincides with an interchange between the sensible fields related to the different sense organs. The different levels crossed by Pierre’s passage in the sensation constitute a sort of profound modulation, overflowing every single field and crossing all fields, as if the wall could also potentially be an odour, a taste, a sound, a vision, revealing the wall-sensation as rhythmic in its snaking among the senses. The clear perception of the wall is therefore
