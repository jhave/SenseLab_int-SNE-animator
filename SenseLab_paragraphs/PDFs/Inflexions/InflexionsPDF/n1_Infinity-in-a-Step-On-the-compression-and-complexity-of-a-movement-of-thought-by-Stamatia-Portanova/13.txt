Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari identify the most important and difficult outcome of creation with the capacity to transform the volatile, acrobatic fugacity of ideas and to bend the malleability of matter into a body that can “stand on its own feet”. For the two philosophers, there is a compositional possibility which is neither related to physical possibility nor to imagination, and which gives the most acrobatic postures of body and mind the strength  to be balanced. Many  artworks cannot stand for  even one instant.  For an artwork (and, by extension, for a philosophical concept or a scientific function), to stand by itself does not mean to have a top and a bottom, nor to stand upright, but only denotes the act through which a material composition (of gestures, words or numbers) preserves itself as a monument. Drawing on these conceptualizations, it is possible to consider thought as a generative event through which the elasticity of matter, the speed of the sensing body in movement and the virtuality of ideas converge into a solid form of expression. This article explores three different qualities generally attributed to intellectual creation, highlighting its malleability and its capacity to mutate into interdisciplinary directions:
