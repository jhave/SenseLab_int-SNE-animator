position, or focus, from which reality starts to take form, while the subjective soul makes its appearance as “what remains in point of view, what occupies point of view, and without which point of view would not be “ (Deleuze 2006 24). The first requisite of conscious subjective thought and of its conceptual organization is therefore an act of compression whereby an elastic matter/thought passes through the restricted region of a point of view. As an infinity, an ideal condition or a virtuality implicit in matter/thought, the idea can only exist by adapting itself to the measure of an enveloping soul and can only manifest itself through its actualization into a subjective thought.
