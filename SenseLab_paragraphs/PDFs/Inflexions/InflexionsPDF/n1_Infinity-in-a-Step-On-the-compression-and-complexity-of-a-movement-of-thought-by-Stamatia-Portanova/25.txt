A particular quality can never be delimited as a definite quantity (or defined as a circumscribable attribute) but is always expressed by an infinitesimal cipher contained between two variables: a speed becomes an event,  a  predicate of  the moving body  thought  as  a  concept.  If  the  world’s  material  mechanisms  work through the continuous transmission and reception of movement, “like ripples [or folds] that a stone creates when it is thrown into water”, or like vibrations created by the emerging of a thought, the psychic mechanisms of the monad’s consciousness need a contraction, a selection of sent and received vibrations, in order to include, perceive, express, a portion of the whole world more clearly. In other words, a monad/soul extracts a clear differential zone from an infinity of minuscule dark vibrations, and in this way, a predicate can be included into the creation of a concept. Beyond (or outside) the monad’s clear perceptions, a continuous thread connects all different series (or all qualitative limits): the world now appears as a unique series of indiscernible bodies all reciprocally linked. The differential, or the limit, between all the series (i.e. the approximate separation of individual bodies and souls in the continuity of the world) is conceived by Leibniz as the result of an operation external to the monad, a mathematical calculation by God itself.
