The Leibnizian conception of a concert, or a choir, of disconnected souls, delineates the monad’s conscious activity as an act of perfectly tuned harmony, revealing the nature of thought  (and therefore of philosophical creation) as necessarily linked to a sort of collaboration ‘at a distance’. Amplifying the limits of the monad’s solipsistic thought and expanding the idea of a distant collaboration of souls, Alfred North Whitehead’s concept of the ‘actual occasion of experience’ introduces the possibility of a relation, a contact, a sense of touch  among  souls.  In  Whitehead’s  own  words,  in  every  ‘actual  occasion  of  experience’  (such  as  a perception or a thought) an object is ‘prehended’ by a subject. The distance and independence of monads from each other and from the world is replaced by an affective influence: a prehension, i.e. an activity of the subject, is directly provoked by the object through the awakening of a feeling or an ‘affective tone’. It is important to note the non-anthropomorphic nature of prehension as a non-human affective response and as the immanent affective ground of all perceptions (physical prehensions) and thoughts (conceptual prehensions): the stone prehends the water it falls into. Highlighting this prehensive character of the ‘actual occasion of experience,’ Deleuze traces a fundamental difference between the Leibnizian and the Whiteheadian philosophical methodologies:
