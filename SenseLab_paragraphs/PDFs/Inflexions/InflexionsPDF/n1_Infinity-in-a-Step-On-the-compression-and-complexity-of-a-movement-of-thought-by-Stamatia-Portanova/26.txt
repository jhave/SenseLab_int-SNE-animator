One of the most recent mathematical formulations, Gregory Chaitin’s theory of algorithmic complexity,' is a re-elaboration of the Leibnizian (and Pythagorean) idea of the world as an infinite (but not indefinite) mathematical series, into the field of information theory. Chaitin’s theory of complexity shows absolute compression and unification (the search for an essential law, such as π) more as tendencies than as accomplished facts: with its interminable chains of zeros and ones, Chaitin’s differential calculus of the number Ω (an information theory version of π) reveals the impossibility of a [de]finite calculation of the precise limits of a computer program. In this sense, differential reveals the complexity and instability of
