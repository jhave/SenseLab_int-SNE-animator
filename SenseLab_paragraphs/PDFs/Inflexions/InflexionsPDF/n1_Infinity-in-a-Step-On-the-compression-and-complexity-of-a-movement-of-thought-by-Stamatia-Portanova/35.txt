For Whitehead it involves prehensions being directly connected to each other, either because they draw on others for data and form a world with them, or because they exclude others (negative prehensions),  but  always  in  the same universe in  process.  For  Leibniz,  to  the  contrary,  monads exclude only universes that are incompossible with their world, and all those that exist express the same world without exclusion. […]: they ‘express one another’ without harnessing each other. We might say that in the two instances monadic or prehensive units have neither doors nor windows. But for Leibniz, it is because the monads’ being-for the world is submitted to a condition of closure, all compossible monads including a single and same world. Now for Whitehead, to the contrary, a condition of opening causes all prehension to be already the  prehension of another prehension, either to control it or to exclude it. Prehension is naturally open, open onto the world, without having to pass through a window (1993, 92).
