The paradoxical relation of affection (or, for Deleuze and Guattari, of ‘affect’) to the body (as being of it but always escaping, outside of it) unfolds as a vibratory event, an intensive state of the body exceeding itself and its own confines or subjective positions. In this sense, affect is defined by Brian Massumi as an incorporeal, abstract dimension, the unleashing of a bodily potential before and beyond the realisation of a perception or a movement (5). Echoing Massumi’s words, we can argue that the abstractness of the body coincides with its never being present in position but only in passing, with its being never actualized but always real, in a moment of instantaneous emergence arising and disappearing again like the crest of a wave. This abstract dimension of emerging tendencies traces the concrete corporeal space of the dancing body with multiple coexistent vectors, virtual vectors which are nevertheless inseparable from the process of their actualization, in a coexistence and reciprocal influence of virtual and actual levels. Out of these multiple tendencies, only one is actually selected and realized as a concrete bodily movement: an infinity of potentials is reduced, or compressed, into a unique step: “Moments of rest: when we feel the potential field of movement, circulating as a ‘before and after’ of the actual physical trajectory of a body in motion. Movement after rest: when the body could go in any potential direction in order to always escape its own […] bodyimage” (Heilmann).
