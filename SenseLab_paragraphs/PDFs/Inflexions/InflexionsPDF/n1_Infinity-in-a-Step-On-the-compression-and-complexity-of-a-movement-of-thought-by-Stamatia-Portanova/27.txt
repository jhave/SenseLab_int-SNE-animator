thought, as an amplification or an opening, the sudden clearing of an idea in the compressed monadic mind. Three centuries earlier, Leibniz himself had already intuitively tried to supersede the limited and limiting possibilities of a compressed philosophy by postulating, in resonance with a Baroque aesthetical and ethical sense of chiaroscuro, an infinite openness, a modulated gradation, between the two limiting extremes of a series (such as light and shadow, or zero and one). A sort of stretchable relational line between two unitary terms is thus established. It is at this point that Leibniz’s thought makes a whole turn on itself and reveals its elasticity: being caught in the Baroque (artistic and mathematical) taste for gradation, his philosophy gets entangled into the limits of its own monadism, being divided (or stretched) between the fascinated attraction for the world’s  complexity, and  the necessity  of its  rigid envelopment into  the  totalitarian mind of  the monad. In Leibniz’s unstable philosophical construction, mathematics appears thus as an example of thought’s elastic adaptation to different modes and methodologies, and of its capacity to expand the limited clear zone of the monad’s consciousness.
