-	Abstractness, considered here as the absolute separation of body and mind, and as the consequent relegation of the latter into an incorporeal realm of total distance from material processes, another limitation overcome, for example, in dance. Blindspot. Solo for a Blindfolded Breakdancer (2005), a dance piece conceived by Nora Heilmann and performed  by  Pierre-Yves  Diacon,  shows  the  impossibility  of  a  separation  between thought and movement, the two things being actually indiscernible as the two sides of one and the same act, brought together at the connective threshold of a sensation: a thought never being different from its energetic, nervous actualisation, a movement never being distinguishable from the sudden jumping out of its idea. The technicality and articulation of the performance, its structural organization of gestures, steps, moments of rest, and also sounds, silences, light and dark, is what transforms the flowing motions and ideas of the improvising dancer into a balanced form of expression.
