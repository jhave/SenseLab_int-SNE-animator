In the sensori-motor present of the body, a sensation always marks the threshold between past and future, the prolongation of past experiences into new ones, and of perceptions into actions. Between an antecedent perception and the execution of a subsequent movement, Bergson individuates ‘affection’ as a tendency to move, a movement begun but not fully executed, a force which makes the body elastic, tense and ready to jump. The mark, or registering, of this felt affection in the body is a sensation: more precisely, the body feels itself in a sensation.
