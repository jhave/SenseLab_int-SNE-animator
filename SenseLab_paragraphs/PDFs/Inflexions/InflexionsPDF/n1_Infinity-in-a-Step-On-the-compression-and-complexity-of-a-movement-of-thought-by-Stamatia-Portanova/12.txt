imagination, at the singular connective point where the absolute virtuality and openness of the mind encounters the inertia and elasticity of matter. The conception of a general idea (the rational definition of a self-identical subject and of an immutable notion attached to it) stands at the exact center and represents a momentary freezing, a state of apparently stable equilibrium between the two  extremes of thought and action, as if both had come to a standstill. On the other hand, the singular idea (the vague singularity of thought) emerges as a glimpse, an intuitive sense, from different degrees of combination and complementarity between these two tendencies. In other words, ideas can only be generated in the continuous aspiration to pure thought (the dreamer) or to pure action (the automaton) but without fully realizing or blocking them, always keeping the thinkerâ€™s movement in a sort of acrobatically balanced, meta- stable composition of body and mind.
