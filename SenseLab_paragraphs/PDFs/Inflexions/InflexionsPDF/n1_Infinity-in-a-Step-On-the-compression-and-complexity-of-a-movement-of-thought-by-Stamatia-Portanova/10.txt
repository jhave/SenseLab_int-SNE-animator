mathematical function, a philosophical concept or an artwork). The model for science, philosophy and art (as well as for life) is therefore the origami, a paper-game where “unfolding is […] not the contrary of folding, but follows the fold up to the following fold” (6). The distinction between the generation and dissipation of forms, or between the complication and explication of thoughts, is always ambiguous, the double face of a process without any fixed model. The continuous passage from fold to fold, the simultaneity of formal composition and decomposition, the necessity to break a code in order to enter a new one, constitutes the ontogenetic tendencies of an autopoietic matter drawn by its own forces: bodily, terrestrial, even cosmic forces, elastic and plastic forces pushing matter and thought to take and lose form, animating the concreteness and ideality of creation without any need for creators or models. Overcoming the hylomorphic definition of creation, the conceptualization of a material [un]folding also challenges the dichotomy between concrete production and abstract thinking, suggesting that thought (as the generative matrix of creation) is not conceived by, but is in and of the autonomous materiality of the body, a body that thinks not only by words or concepts, but also by images, gestures or numerical figures. Here, the thinking body is intended not as the phenomenological subject manipulating, rationalizing and dominating an external world, but as “a processual entity that transforms and is transformed by the relational sensing matrices it instantiates through its movements”.1 In other words, thought can only be generated in the sensing body in movement, a body that is creating and being created elastically, folding and being folded by its environment.
