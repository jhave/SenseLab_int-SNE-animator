The temporality of proprioceptive sensations eclipses the body from subjective time, as an interruption or a gap in empirical time and a punctuation of its linear unfolding, a suspension in which movement is without qualified form, a transformational moment in which something attracts and something is irremediably attracted. As an example of movement articulation from anatomical and motor disarticulation, break-dance is a good example of motor disconnection, by multiplying and accentuating the composed character of the performance and the electrified cuts between the body’s jerks. The dancer cuts movement apart and pushes it to the extremes, twisting a turn until the body is spinning on shoulders and butts: “Flow being broken into multiple rhythms, polyrhythmic relations. Movement as a break into the static of form. Rest as a break into flow of movement” (Heilmann).   Stopping motion through a multiplicity of sudden freezes or holding the positions between steps, Pierre highlights the coexistence of fluidity and jerks in the same plane of kinetic consistency. On this plane, hits (sudden muscularized stops that can be on the beat or syncopated) and isolations (moving one part of the body, like a shoulder or a hip, while keeping the other parts still), krumping (rapid-fire moves of the chest and pelvis) and other precise movements that lock or stop in place before the next one begins, emphasize the broken nature of motion, while the body is traversed by a flow of electricity constituting the energetic continuum of dance.
