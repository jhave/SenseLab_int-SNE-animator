conceptualization of the moving body as materially entering an already existing wave (the flow of particle/waves revealed by quantum physics as the rhythm of matter). From this point of view, every step immerses the body into the molecular motion of the matter (air/floor/walls) surrounding it, an aggregate of particles among particles. Recurring to topology as the science of the intensive, qualitative tracing of movement (rather than of its measurement), we can imagine the abstract schema (or diagram) of the qualitative transformations undergone by the body in its performance. In the continuous gliding or slurring of movements, every gestural unit appears as a synthetic compression of micro-gestures that cannot be easily isolated, presupposing multiple articulations of heterogeneous elements imbricated into each other (for  example  toes,  ankles,  knees,  legs,  as  the  different  topological  points  of  a  step).  A  continuous topological elasticity draws the concreteness and rigidity of the body with a plane of multiple tendencies going beyond the restricted, compressed consciousness of the dancerâ€™s body-subject and its conception of a linear sequence of steps. The body as always ready to fold itself into a myriad of different positions, gestures and shapes.
