When you think, you do not only collaborate with other subjects and with the different temporal instances of your own self; you always collaborate with a whole environment. Beyond the individual existence of the subjective soul as woven, or synthesised, through an almost linear connection between different temporal moments or occasions of experience, the material concreteness of the body is conceptualized by Whitehead as an intrinsic part of the external environment and as being continuous with it: “if we are fussily exact, we cannot define where a body begins and where external nature ends” (Whitehead 1938, 21). In other words, as opposed to the mono-dimensionality of the soul, the body appears multidimensionally linked to its environment.   What   happens,   then,   in   the   passage   from   a   sequential   subjectivity   to   an   extended corporeality? The concatenation of a subjective soul (a consciously thinking mind) finds a parallel in a corresponding material coagulation; the soul implicates (or, for Leibniz, it ‘dominates’) a body.
