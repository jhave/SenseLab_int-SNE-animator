The different potential vectors crossing Pierre’s steps do not only transform its own body surface into a malleable field open to different motor possibilities, but are also prolonged towards the outside. In just one movement, his elastic body opens a series of coexistent connections in an infinite multiplicity of directions: being mnemonically and sensorially connected to the wall that propelled its motion and to the floor that supports it, its horizontal, vertical, diagonal prehensions of the environment are simultaneously crossed by a persistent matrix of relations. The unique restricted pathways taken by the body in its continuous frontward motions are actually populated by all the transversal, multidimensional links entertained with ground, air, walls, atmosphere, etc. In other words, every single step is already relational, a fluid occupation from which the modelling of space emerges as an after-effect: “[I]t is no longer a thing that is modelled in space, but space that is modelled by ‘a thing’ (the body); material gives form to the immaterial (space as a set of relations)” (Gil 116). In this way, a new space/body assemblage is formed at every new step (Gil 124). Every step as the weaving of a collaborative network between the body and its environment.
