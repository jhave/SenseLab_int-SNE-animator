As  a  form  of  creation,  thought  is  never  totally  balanced  but  always  of  a  disarming  complexity.  In  all expressive forms, “as in all things, there are lines of articulation or segmentarity, strata and territories” (Deleuze and Guattari, 2002, 3), a structural and functional organisation able to transform the intellectual or artistic creation into a solid organism (of concepts, of mathematical operations, of gestures and steps) cemented by a degree of unity. As “the art of forming, inventing and fabricating concepts”, philosophical creation  can  also  be  thought  through  this  organic  parallel.  The  same  level  of  reciprocal  coherence, inherence and adherence of the components characterizes both the corporeal and mental, the material and philosophical expressions of a body. In this sense, conceptual creation closely resembles the Leibnizian body, a complex elastic multiplicity conceived, assembled and structured as a solid unitary organism by a mysterious unifying entity.
