accompanied by an amodal rhythmic sensation, while Pierre differentially calculates its qualities; the tense body senses the wall as rhythm, vibrating between the anticipation of a future movement (pre-acceleration) and the reminiscence of a past perception. The link between a past (wall) and a future (movement) (what Whitehead defines as the ‘work of the mind’, in other words thought) is felt rhythmically, a sensation appearing in the body as the mark of the imminent emerging of a thought in the mind (the idea to move). Crossing Pierre’s body as a vibratory wave, sensation traces it with levels or thresholds according to the variations of its own amplitude: before being qualitatively qualified as a wall, it is conducted and diffused along the nervous system. Ideas appear as immanent points of the wave, critical moments of unpredictable qualitative change (rather than realizations of a transcendental choreography). The multiple encounters with other bodies (for example the horizontal perception of the floor and the vertical bumping into the wall) bring the dancer’s body to different critical points: energy is continuously distributed in different directions, stasis becomes motion, the body is affected, alters its speed and accelerates. He feels the wall, he runs, stops against the opposite wall, feels again, the tactile qualities of space affecting his motion.
