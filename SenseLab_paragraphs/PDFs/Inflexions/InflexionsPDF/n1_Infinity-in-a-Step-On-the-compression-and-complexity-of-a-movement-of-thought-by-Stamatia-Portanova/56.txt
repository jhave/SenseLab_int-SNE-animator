In Pierre’s body without an image, the perceptual feedback on movement derives from proprioception: “There is in fact a sixth sense attuned to the movement of the body: proprioception. It involves specialized sensors in the muscles and joints. Proprioception is a self-referential sense, in that what it most directly registers are displacements of the parts of the body relative to each other” (Massumi 2002, 179). “The dancer creates new spaces as he recomposes his movements and orients proprioceptively” (Heilmann). Registering quality as a condition for movement (for example, floor hardness as condition for jumping), Pierre’s body links it to the posture, position and orientation of its single components. Before and beyond the  re-construction  of  a  complete  bodily  image,  proprioceptive  sensations  pass,  in  continuous  and decentred streams of electric signals, through the body’s neurological network system.
