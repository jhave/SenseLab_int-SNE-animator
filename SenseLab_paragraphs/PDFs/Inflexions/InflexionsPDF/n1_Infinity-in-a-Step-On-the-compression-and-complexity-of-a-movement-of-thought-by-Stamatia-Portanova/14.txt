-	Compression,  i.e.  the  necessity  to  synthesize  ideas  into  a  univocal  concept,  as   a contraction of thought. With a connection between philosophy and mathematics, differential calculus reveals thought as an irreducible complexity where the singular units (concepts or numbers) become necessarily approximate and open to outside infiltrations.
-	Solitude,  in  the  sense  of  a  limited  nature  of  thought  as  a  monadic  act.  This  further compressive aspect is opened up by ideas of relationality and collaboration, transforming intellectual creation into an autopoietic process of connection between different subjects, and also between the different moments or occasions of the same self.
