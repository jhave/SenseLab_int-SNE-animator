the  product of a focus  on  the  thin  line  between doing  and  being done,  between the  body  as  lived  from  within and  as  acted  upon from    without,   between   the    body     given     three-dimensional awareness through physical interaction and  the body  effaced  by its use in collective  symbolic interaction. (Katz 1999: 342)
