And in entering into relationship with  this creaturely dynamic, we work  with  the fact  of it being  an  always unfinished product, of being  a complex puzzle that can’t  so much  be  solved  or  known definitively, but  played with,  that  must  be played with in an on-going way.
As  designers,  the   issue   is  how   we   purposefully  configure  an  open   set  of dynamics that  puts  things into play.  Arakawa and  Madeline Gins talk about  this act of “a tentative constructing towards a holding in place”  (Gins and  Arakawa
2002:   23).   This   tentative,   holding   in-place-but-open  allows,    as   Madeline suggested earlier,  for  “it  to  come”  forward, to  not  force  this  dynamic into  the world,  but   to  elicit  it,  our   relationship  with   it  as  both   separate  to  us,  and something we are integral to.
