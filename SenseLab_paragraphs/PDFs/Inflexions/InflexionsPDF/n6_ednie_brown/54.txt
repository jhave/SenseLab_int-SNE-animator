As Jondi suggests there,  the gaps  and  the laughter were  linked  to falling, and  this involved real, physical falling  and  potential broken legs, but  it also connects, or resonates with  falling  of different kinds.  Arakawa and  Gins aim to throw us off balance,   starting with  the  suggestion that  deciding not  to  die  is  a  possibility (which  throws most  people at  least  a little  bit),  and  moving into  enumerated tactics  across  different media to productively destabilize our  habitualised certainties.
