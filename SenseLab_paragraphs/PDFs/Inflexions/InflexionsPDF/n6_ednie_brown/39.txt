This  quality of connection, this  dynamic, is held  open  in the  work  of Arakawa and  Gins in order to allow  for and  encourage the dynamic to change and  evolve into a new  creature. Perhaps A+G are like bioenergetic therapists engaged in the task  of prodding old,  stuck  architectural problems into  play,  such  that  (like  in Miranda July’s story)  the dynamic leaps  into its own  creaturely shape,  wriggling free of its servitude, so that it no longer  ‘serves’ confused families,  but is an acknowledged  life  of  the   family.   Their   prodding  gives   outline  to  an  open dynamic of the  organism-person-environment – which  is both  a truly  complex family  dynamic, and  a creature unto  itself. If we are organisms that  person, the organism-person-environment is an organism that creatures. It is both something we are part  of, and  something unto  itself – it is a three-part cleavage that  plaits infinite  strands of hairy  connection into an open  loop.
