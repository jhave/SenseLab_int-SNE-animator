Oh look – look at that  Elbisrever!  I wonder what  it is? It’s amazing. Look, there’s a little tag. What does it say? This is a Hyperbolic Evolution Accelerator. It says it works   as  a  perpetual  motion machine, though it’s  not  really  a  ‘machine’  but rather an organism-person-environment dynamic.
It’s a dynamic, Elbisrever. (Elbisrever nods)
