Both  play   and   the  art  of  emergence are  related to  laughter.  Laughter is  an emergent eruption that  arises  when two  or  more  inconsistencies co-inhabit an event,  such  that  the ground of social conduct, on which  our behaviours dance  to collectively recognised  forms,  is destabilized. In  laughing we  acknowledge that destabilization (as we are thrown by coexistent incompatibilities within the moment),  while   at  the   same   time   finding  a  corporeal  re-grounding  as  we reconnect into the rhythmic shudders of our organismic lives.
