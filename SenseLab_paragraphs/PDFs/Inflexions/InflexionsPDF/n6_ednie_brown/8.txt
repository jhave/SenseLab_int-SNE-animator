I chose Play School as a model  in the hope  that  it would tickle Arakawa and  Gins’ notion of ‘reversible  destiny’  by taking  the  grown-up academic scenario into  a childhood scene.  More  importantly, it becomes  part  of a proposition about  the importance of PLAY as a mode  of activity  integral to Arakawa and  Gins’ idea  of procedural architecture.
