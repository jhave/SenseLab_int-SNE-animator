I am also trying to set up a condition that  might  intensify a requirement to ride a line between being  in control  and  out-of-control, between sense  and  non-sense, between holding together and  falling  apart. Aiming to ride  this line calls upon a kind    of   virtuosity,  that    I   have    argued   elsewhere  has   profound  ethical implications, that  I  call  ‘the  art  of  emergence,’  or  ethico-aesthetic  know-how (Ednie-Brown  2008).  Arakawa  and   Gins   are   primo  virtuosos  at  the   art   of emergence.
