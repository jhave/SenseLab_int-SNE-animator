Madeline, we’ve  been  playing with  the open  ended Plastic Futures house.  We’re hoping you  can  help  take  everyone watching at  home  inside  to  play  with  the house  as well, and  to do this as a kind  of architectural procedure, because you  are so good  at that.  We want  to use it as an architectural surround, a collective  landing site, or a tactically posed surround. Now  these are all terms  you use. Sometimes you call them  terminological junctions… But Madeline, what  we’re wondering, first off, is if these terms  are all about  manipulating systems of perception?
Sound file of Madeline Gins speaking, from Slought Foundation symposium:
“Perception closes  it and  it’s a word and  comes  in. Clunk.  We want  to open  it. We want  to open  it and  we want  to have  a sense,  as I said  before,  of bioscleave. We  want   a  set  of  dynamics. Each  of  these  terms,   which   are  approximative, rigorous abstractions, hold  open  a set of dynamics. And  then  we don’t name  into it  any  further until  it  comes  to  us.  We  proceed. Otherwise, our  race  just  sits around and pens texts and then croaks”  (Arakawa et al. 2007).
