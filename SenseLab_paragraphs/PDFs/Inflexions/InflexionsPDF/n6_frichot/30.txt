In a footnote to Francis Bacon: The Logic of Sensation, Gilles Deleuze cites Bateson’s reference to  William  Blake  in  the  above  metalogue (Deleuze 2003: 161, fn  18). Depending on where and  when one refers  to Blake, it appears that  according to the  poet,  both  wise  and  mad  men  draw outlines around things. What  Blake understood, according to Deleuze was  that  “a line that  delimits nothing still has a contour or outline itself” (Deleuze 2003: 83). In Deleuze’s treatment of the paintings of Bacon,  the  pictorial concept  of the  contour is located  between the figure  and  the field. The field or ground here, which  Deleuze calls aplat, is given as an  infinite,  though monochromatic and  flat plane.  The aplat is a spatializing and  material structure that  extends indefinitely. Across  the  threshold (Deleuze also  calls  it a membrane, (2003: 13)) is a two-way passage between figure  and field,  which  move  in  and  through each  other  like  Ponge’s  snail  and  its  earthy ground. The rhythm that  modulates this to-ing  and  fro-ing  operates according to an  approach, an  embrace and  a  withdrawal, which  defines and  then  in  turn dissipates the figure.
