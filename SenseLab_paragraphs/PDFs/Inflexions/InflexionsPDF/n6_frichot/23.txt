Arakawa and  Gins’ dialogue with  Angela  and  Robert  is interrupted by the figure of  a  snail,  borrowed from  the  poet  Francis   Ponge.   The  snail  is  given   as  an exemplary creature, intimately uniting organism and  environment in the form of its shell as an architectural body.  “They go through it. It goes through them” (Gins and  Arakawa 2002: 26). Snail and  environment interpenetrate and  in the process excrete  the  architectural body.  What  is  performed  between the  snail  and  the dialogue is the inseparability of organism plus  environment as the basic unit  of life.  What  is  curious about   the  snail  is  that  without its  house   it  becomes   as amorphous as a slug,  and  with  it, we  are  able  to identify some  sort  of outline. Likewise,  the  house  that  Angela  and  Robert  slowly  unfurl through a  kind  of purposeful proprioception and  kinaesthetic sited  awareness is nothing but an amorphous heap  before they come to activate it. This is not to suggest that things without outlines are necessarily bad.  An amorphous state  of affairs  may  simply be an  architectural body  in the  midst of finding a form  for the  meantime. The conversation between Gregory Bateson  and  his daughter, which  I will introduce below,   demonstrates  that   the  status  of  the  outline  is  not  always  definitive. Instead the  outline, for  instance, between an  organism and  an  environment, is that threshold along which  transformations are apt to occur.
