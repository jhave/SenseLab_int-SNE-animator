will  be  the  daughter and  will  ask:  Daddy, why  do  things have  outlines? This question is framed in one of the metalogues that  open  the most  recent  edition of Gregory Bateson’s  book,  Steps to an Ecology of Mind.  Bateson  is an  appropriate companion for Arakawa and  Gins as he too stresses that  an organism cannot  be without her environment, natural or artefactual. Bateson also extends the concept of ecology beyond fixed images  of wilderness scenes or Nature. Ecologies pertain as  much   to  mind  as  to  matter,  to  nature  as  well   as  technology  and   the complicated changeable matrixes that articulate and  blur these, and  that question any  quick  distinctions. For  Bateson  organism plus  environment form  the  basic unit  of survival. Scene three  works  outwards from  a footnote in Gilles Deleuze’s Francis Bacon: The Logic of Sensation, where he refers  by way  of the poet  William Blake to Gregory Bateson  and  this question of outlines. Through the medium of Francis   Bacon’s  paintings,  the  outline  is  described  by  Deleuze as  a  contour between a figure  and  an infinite,  monochromatic, flat ground. In the final scene we establish that  we do not yet know  what  an (architectural) body  can do, which will  be taken  as a challenge to continue thinking-doing, and  along  the  way  to maintain an ethical know-how that concerns itself quite  simply with coping.
