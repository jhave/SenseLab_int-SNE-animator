Arakawa and  Gins’  procedures for making an  architectural body  are  practiced until  they  become  habitual, they  are  like walking, eating,  talking, they  move  in and   out   of  awareness,  and   presumably,  if  they   are   fostered  they   can   be articulated as an active  ethico-aesthetics. They insist  that  procedures should also be entered “wittingly” and  that  they  can  be cultivated, in much  the  same  way that  Varela  has  described with  respect to ethical  know-how (Gins and  Arakawa
2002:  53).  It  is  how   these   procedures are  writ   large   and   how   the  feedback between skills and  “perspicacious intellect” (Gins and  Arakawa 2002: 54) can be generated at scales that  exceed  the unit  of the home  and  extend into a world that is evidently one  of the  larger  aspirations of Arakawa and  Gins.  She  wonders, finally, what  kind  of outline does a global ecological  architectural body  make?
