First  there   is  the  suggestion that  the  body   by  way  of  its  awareness extends beyond the  corporeal limitations we  tend  to  constrain it within. Awareness is always sited,  aroused through the  specificity and  haecceity of locatedness, it is not locked  inside  the conscious body.  In fact, sited  awareness is already an entry to  the  architectural  body,   and   like  the  BwO  it  is  already  accomplished the moment  you   undertake  it:  “it  is  an  inevitable  exercise   or  experimentation” (Deleuze and  Guattari 1987: 149). At the same  time,  and  paradoxically, although its activation is inevitable, it can never  be satisfied or completed, instead you are forever  attaining it, for it is a limit! The sensate, conscious body,  (including all its pre-conscious workings), is apt to unfold into a world, to grope  about,  to feel and suck, to think  and do by extending into its environment.
