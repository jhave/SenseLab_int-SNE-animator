There is some sort of a thinking feeling  body  and  there  is an atmospheric sack of something  that   surrounds this  body.   Sometimes  the  sack  is  sickening  close, liquid, sticky and  claustrophobic sometimes it flies out wide  like a wayward sail and  leaves  her body  cold and  exposed, the air too rarefied. The relation between organism and  environment operates at many  scales,  from  the foreground of the near-near, to the background of the far-far away.  The relative scale is determined by what  Arakawa and  Madeline Gins have  called the organism-that-persons, presumably in order to give  her  a conjunctive capacity to feel-think. It is along the  precariously defined line,  leaky  and  pliable,  that  draws its path  between a person and  her surroundings that  their  project  for the architectural body  plots  its tentative course,   one  that  is  necessarily, always  tentatively,  open  to  constant revision and  renovation. It is along  this  line,  which  can  also  be conceived as a threshold, that this essay will present a series of scenes all of which  rest upon this line as an outline.
