It is a question of ethics  as well  as aesthetics, but  not according to a fixed set of codes or locked  procedures. Ethics is derived from the place we call home  and  its attendant sentiments. That  is, ethics  is derived by our  ethos,  the  kind  of ethical know-how  at  work   here  makes   no  assumptions about   what   constitutes this home,  or the relation of one home  to the next, or their relation with  the town,  and the  town’s  relation with  the  region,  and  so  on.  Although Arakawa and  Gins discuss what  they call a crisis ethics—in  order to challenge mortality in favour of a reversible destiny that  indefinitely prolongs life (Gins and  Arakawa 2002: xviii,
95)—it is as much  the ethics at work  in the embodied coping  and  tactical groping toward and  through the  architectural body  that  is of concern  to  her.  As  they move  through a home  that  emerges in response to the  explorative gropings of their  bodies,   everything about   the  dialogue between Angela   and  Robert  and Arakawa  and   Gins   ventures  a  tentative  tactics,   a  kind   of  know-how  that supposedly responds to contingent encounters. They  combine an aesthetic with an  ethical   comportment.  That  is  to  say,  they   distribute their   portion of  the
