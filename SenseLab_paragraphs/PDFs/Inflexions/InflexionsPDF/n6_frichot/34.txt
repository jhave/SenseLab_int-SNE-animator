If the  contour, the  outline, is ever  unfolding as the  common limit  and  place  of exchange  between  organism  and   environment,  between  the   organism-that- persons and  her bioscleave, and  the problem is one of continuing to test tactical procedures that  propose or pose  an architectural body  that  is never  at rest,  but forever  redefining this outline, how  does she cope with  all this perpetual experimentation?  In  forwarding  his  concept   of  ethical   know-how,  Francisco Varela  suggests that  “actions such  as these  do  not  spring from  judgement  and reasoning, but  from  an  immediate coping with  what  is confronting us”  (Varela,
1992: 5). [1] Arakawa and  Gins  likewise  affirm  that:  “Whatever has  come  to be know  how has been cast as procedural” (Gins and Arakawa 2002: 52).
