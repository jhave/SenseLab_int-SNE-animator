Arakawa and  Gins tell us that  “the  inextricability of person and  bioscleave must at all costs  be respected” (Gins  and  Arakawa 2002: 95), this  is announced as an ethical  imperative. The bioscleave by definition already includes the person as a component of what  cleaves.  It is a neologism that  augments the term  biosphere by suggesting that not enough is rendered at stake in this term.  That is to say, the biosphere, the sphere that sustains life, can only be thought in terms  of this active and  passive life, or bios. There  is much  to be done  between the  organism-that- persons,  and   biosphere,  and   how   they   cleave   together.  Between   these   two changeable conditions an architectural body,  or a tactically  posed surround, can be creatively modulated. The architectural body,  always tentatively described by Arakawa and  Gins falls neither entirely on the side of the organism-that-persons, nor  on the  side  of the  ecological  niche  or specific  biosphere in which  she  finds herself.  Architecture is a form  of life, and  like all forms  of life, it is tentative and uncertain and  proceeds according to trial and  error  (Gins and  Arakawa 2002: 49). Given this precarious ground and the wavering outline that allows  the organism- that-persons some purchase in her bioscleave, how is it that  she can make  herself an  architectural body?  One  thing  is for certain,  “At  any  rate,  you  have  one  (or several)” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 149).
