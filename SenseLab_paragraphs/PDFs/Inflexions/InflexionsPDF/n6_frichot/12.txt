If we translate this ethical imperative into the language of Arakawa and  Gins it is a  question  of  which   procedures  can  be  best   applied  to  produce  the   most adequate architectural body.  Yet the body,  the organism-plus-environment continues to  strive,  grow,  transform,  practice, and  experiment. “A  person can never  get to the bottom of her own  alertness”, Arakawa and  Gins say (2002: 52). Deleuze likewise  stresses that “existence is a test” in the sense of being a material or chemical test—rather than  a test in which  the answers are already determined (Deleuze 1988: 40). The  ethical  imperative is one  that  needs  to  be  continually applied, as experimentation is ongoing (since we never  get to the bottom of our own  alertness or  capacity to  act).  It is important to  note  that  for  Deleuze and Guattari how  to make  a BwO is also “a question of life and  death” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 151), an ongoing experimentation. With their  operative concept  of the  architectural body  Arakawa and  Gins  emphasise the  prosthetic component: the architectural surround.
