between  a  daughter  and   her   father.   As  Bateson’s   own   daughter  explains “daughter is uncorrupted by academic labelling and  becomes  Father’s excuse  to approach issues  outside of their  boundaries” (ix). Embedded in the approach of these  dialogues (as the performance of dialogic  thought ambling backwards and forwards) is  the  very  issue  of  the  outline as  a  threshold between disciplines; between things;  between organisms and  their  environments, and  importantly, how  this  threshold always needs  to be tested. The metalogue, Bateson  explains, is  like  a  conversation  between  man   and   nature “in  which   the  creation and interaction of ideas  must  necessarily exemplify evolutionary  process” (Bateson
2000: 1). As with  the architectural body,  there  is not  necessarily an end  point  to this  process.   Instead what   is  produced  is  an  ongoing  conversation  between organism and environment.
