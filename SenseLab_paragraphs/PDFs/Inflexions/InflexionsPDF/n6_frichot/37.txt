They  also cope  with  contingent encounters through a combination of conscious and  subconscious ‘procedures’. Varela does  caution that  ethical  know-how is not simply an automatic response to a repertoire of habitual responses, but  is rather cultivated through a long  process:  “intelligence should guide our  actions,  but  in harmony with  the texture of the situation at hand” (Varela  1992: 31). Deleuze in his seminars on Spinoza, goes so far as to suggest that  “ethics  tells us nothing, it does  not know” (Deleuze 1980). Instead, ethics is a question of what  you can do, what  you  are  capable  of, and  this  we  will  never  know  in advance. We need  to continue to test the fibre of our existence  in order to see what  we can become,  but never   so  far  as  to  destroy the  very  environment that   supports us,  and   this involves a  whole  exploration of  things, an  experimentation in  contact  with  a world.
