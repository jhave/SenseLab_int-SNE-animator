sufficiently appreciate  what   a  body   can  do  and   how   its  awareness  can  be tactically  activated. That is, we do not engage sufficiently in our own agency,  our capacity  to  create   immanently.  We  have   not   experienced  or  experimented enough. And  this is a problem. This second hypothesis suggests we get caught in the rut  of habit,  we get stuck  in a slump, we donâ€™t challenge ourselves in contact with our environment.
