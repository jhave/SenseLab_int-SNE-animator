The  daughter begins  by  asking  why  do  things have  outlines, for  example, the things that she draws and then colours  in? Her father  counters that conversations and   flocks  of  sheep   do  not  have   outlines.  The  ‘metalogue’  ambles   between arguing for  and  against outlines to  things, such  as  conversations, or  between living  things and  machines, and  even  between ethnic  groups, such  as Jews and Gentiles.  It is as though father  and  daughter are  trying incrementally to work their way through a muddle in which  sometimes things have perceptible outlines and  sometimes they  do  not.  Citing  the  “mad-angry” poet  William  Blake,  the father  suggests that  things without outlines belong  to the  ‘slobbering school’ in that  they  are  inadequate and  poorly thought through. Things  without outlines are considered to be like matter in the  wrong place,  that  is, like dirt,  or spit,  or some  other  abject  material. Without a recognizable outline, how  can  one  think clearly  and  distinctly about  things? Sometimes though, outlines fix too  quickly on things, especially when things include living  things, which  are apt  to change and  evolve.  Where  to draw the outline becomes  a question of how  far something can   be   predicted  or   not,   and    living   things,  it   would  appear,  are   very unpredictable.
