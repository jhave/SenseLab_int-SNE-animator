What  is the  outline between organism and  environmental surround, if any,  by which  the architectural body  is modulated? The architectural body  cannot  be composed without the  body  nor  without the  material and  conceptual stuff  we call  architecture, though it  is  an  architecture considerably rematerialised and reconceptualised.  For   Arakawa  and   Gins   the   architectural  body   is  always concretely  hypothetical.  It  asks   questions  such   as  ‘what   if?’  or  tentatively suggests ‘let’s feel our way.’ Arakawa and  Gins posit  three  hypotheses in Architectural  Body,  which   they   expect   to  be  acted   upon  and   tested.  Their manifesto for constructing an architectural body,  as they  stress  again  and  again, is an ongoing experimentation, that  of venturing a tentative constructing toward a holding in place. There are procedures, which  include a panoply of provocative neologisms to help us think  otherwise than  along habitual pathways.
