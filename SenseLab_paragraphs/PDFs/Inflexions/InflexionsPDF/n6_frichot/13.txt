How  does she make  herself  an architectural body?  She follows  a program of experimentation, which  means  she  gets  lost  on  the  way.  Every  organism-that- persons carries  her  own  instructions with  her  in that  these  instructions are  her immediate  awareness, and   awareness  is  always  concretely sited.   The  event- fabric,   as   Arakawa  and   Gins   call   it,  is  an   immanent  surface   of  variable undulations that  throws only contingencies in her way.  What  she has to learn  to do is to cope both aesthetically and ethically.
