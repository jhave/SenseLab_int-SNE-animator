So  there   are   three   hypotheses  concerning  how   she   can   make   herself   an architectural body,  all of which  tentatively suggest ‘what ifs’. To follow  through the  three  hypotheses requires that  she,  the  organism-that-persons, activate her always available sited  awareness, that  she  recognizes what   is  still  missing in terms  of tactical  procedures, and  that  she contributes further procedures so that the  architectural body   can  be  composed for  the  meantime, provisionally. As Arakawa  and   Gins   explain  to   Angela    and   Robert   in   a   dialogue  within Architectural  Body:  “You  are  not  given   a  finished  house   but  instead form  it through your  movements and  through those  of whoever else  is in  there  with you”  (Gins  and  Arakawa 2002: 28).  The  architectural body   is  not  just  about individual inhabitation, but  is also  intended to activate and  encompass communities. Because  it can  only  be tentatively suggested, Arakawa and  Gins frame  the third chapter, ‘Architecture as Hypothesis’, as an interrupted dialogue. The  dialogue affords   a  performative approach as  we,  the  reader, are  able  to observe Angela  and  Robert,  who  are  presumably clients  of Arakawa and  Gins tentatively groping their  way through a display home  that  demonstrates the principles of the architectural body.  At first the house  appears to be nothing but a semi-transparent or translucent heap  that can be apprehended all at once. Little by little on their  guided tour  Angela  and  Robert  discover new  relations between their   bodies   and   the  environment,  which   they   can  test  and   mould  around
