receding horizon of this not knowing is what  turns out to be productive. In Expressionism  in  Philosophy: Spinoza,  Gilles  Deleuze  explains  that   an  existing mode  (i.e., an architectural-body) is endowed with  a kind  of elasticity, which  is “a  margin, a  limit”  between our  capacity to  be  affected   and  our  capacity to produce active  affects  (Deleuze 1992: 222-223). This  elastic  threshold or outline demarcates the  shifting ratio  between our  power of suffering and  our  power of acting. The ethical question for Deleuze is then a matter of how we produce more active affections  and proportionally reduce our passive responses.
