The epic was a mechanism of memory. The Mechanism of Meaning is an anti-epic – a mechanism of forgetting and  the  fashioning of cognitive holes  through which the  data  of symmetrical systems disappears. It is among the  big  works  of the post-World War  II era, along  with  Pollock’s drip  paintings, the  Maximus  Poems, Free Jazz, Gravity’s Rainbow, the ¼ Mile Piece, and the Spiral Jetty.
