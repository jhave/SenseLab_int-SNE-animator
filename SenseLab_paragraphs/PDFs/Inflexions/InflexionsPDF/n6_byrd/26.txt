Piaget  explicitly  called  out the “corrosive intelligence” of Michel Foucault as a second generation modernist who  attempted to return abstraction to the “enigmatic insistency” of  the  word, as  the  first  generation of  modernists, such   as  Ezra  Pound  and   William   Carlos   Williams,   attempted  to  return abstraction to the radiant, concrete  object. Foucault seemed to have no notion of reflective  abstraction. Certainly he had  no notion of functional abstraction.
