At the outset, conceptualization and  theorization as machines of knowing dissociated generalized structures from  meaning. It was  possible, thus,  to create powerful, generalized formal  systems, such  as the  group theory and  set theory, but it was then necessary to reinterpret their content for meaning. The purity that made  them  possible wrecked them  in their use.
