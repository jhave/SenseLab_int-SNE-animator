14.  Consider Jean  Piaget  on  group theory:  “When a property is arrived at  by abstraction in the ordinary sense of the word, ‘drawn out’ from things which have  the  property, it does,  of course,  tell us  something about  these  things, but  the  more  general the  property, the  thinner and  less useful  it usually is. Now   the   group  concept   or   property  is  obtained,  not   by   this   sort   of abstraction, but  by a mode  of thought characteristic of modern mathematics and  logic – ‘reflective abstraction’ – which  does  not  derive properties from things but  from  our  ways  of acting  on things, the operations we perform on them” (Piaget  1971: 19). Already, group theory was  beyond all previous practice.
