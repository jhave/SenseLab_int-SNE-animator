Generalized  abstraction  was   more   satisfying  as  a  system   of  thinking and knowing  than   any   system   based   on  patent  absurdity  should  have   been.   It worked after  a fashion for twenty-five centuries, perhaps because its processing was slow – its parts  did not communicate – and  the philosopher’s garden was far from  the  work-a-day human world. The meditation on  the  absurdity belonged mostly   to  the   Church  and   the   University,  which   appeared  as  the   secular replacement for the Church in the nineteenth century.
