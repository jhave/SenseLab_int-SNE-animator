32.  We exchange the creative imagination for the creative formation. We do not preadapt by  making an  image   of  the  world that  does  not  exist.  We  see adjacent possible forms  rising  on the  near  edge  of the  future and  enter  into collaboration with them.  It is a way we can overcome our feckless loneliness.
