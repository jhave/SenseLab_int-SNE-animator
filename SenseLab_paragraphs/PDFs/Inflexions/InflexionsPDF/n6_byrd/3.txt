This talk was written  for the AG3 Conference in the spring of 2010. There were daily online discussions of their work (March 12-26) and a culminating face-to-face celebration and visit to the Bioscleave house in New York (April 30-May 2). We knew Arakawa was ill, and he did not appear at the Conference. We did not know how ill. I sat next  to Madeline at the April 30 session at Barnard, and she grasped my forearm, during several of the presentations, squeezing as if she were in pain. It was clear that things were not well. Arakawa died on May 18.
