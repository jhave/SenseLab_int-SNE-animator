Whatever happened was  right  there.  He  made  his  body,  as he made  paintings and  buildings, into a mechanism of meaning. He thought that,  if we could  make cities into mechanisms of the right  kind,  death would not be required of us. The buildings and  what  happened in the buildings had  to be right.  Everything had to be right. We build  cities  as we  might  open  our  bodies  and  work  on  our  inner- organs.
