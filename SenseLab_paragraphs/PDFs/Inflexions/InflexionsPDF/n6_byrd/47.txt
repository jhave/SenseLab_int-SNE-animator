The  last  time  I saw  Arakawa, shortly before  the  onset  of  his  illness,  he  was making a complicated point  about  reversible destiny, and  suddenly, without it being clear where the effort came from, he was on the floor, moving nimbly – like a two-dimensional snake.  It happened so easily  and  slowly  that  I had  time  to think  briefly  that  it wasn’t  clear  whether it was  he or space  and  time  that  were being changing. The floor was unusually far away  and  weirdly configured. I was strange in my body  in the space he made.
