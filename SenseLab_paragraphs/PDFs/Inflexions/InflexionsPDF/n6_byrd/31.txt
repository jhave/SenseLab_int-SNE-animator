23.  The knowing that unlocks the secret of the universe and gives access to god’s system   makes   it   communicants  into   god’s   fools.   God’s   knowledge   is worthless for us. He is eternal, and  we are not. It is possible to negotiate with god  for  freedom, but  it  is absurd freedom:  you  know  everything – all  of logic, all of grammar – but only because you are yourself a bottom-feeder of the unconscious.
