Life as given  is symmetrical. Space-time is symmetrical. Matter  and  energy are conserved, and  their  conversions are symmetrical. Grammar and  logic are symmetrical. Aesthetics conceives  beauty in  terms  of symmetry. These  are  all forms  of life as given  (death as given).  It is when we  take  life, enjoin  life, that things begin to happen.
