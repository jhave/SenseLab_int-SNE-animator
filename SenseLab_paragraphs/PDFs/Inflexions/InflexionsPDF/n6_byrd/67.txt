Olson   and   Arakawa  thought  the   trashing  of  the   subject   was   a  necessary preliminary  to  a  constructive  process.   Olson’s   epic  has  a  single,   controlling device:  the  assembly of the  future in terms  of the  present memory of the  past (“My  memory is the  history of time”).  He  trashed the  historical self in the  first volume of  the  Maximus,  and  the  mythological self  in  the  second volume. He revealed these as “fully physical” processes. At the outset of the third volume, he declared, “I believe  in God  / as fully physical.” Olson’s  mechanism of meaning, however, was never  completed, and  the evidence of it is still for the most  part  in the Archive. The physical god was probably impossible.
