12.		The  history of  philosophy  is  the  history of  symmetry.  The  generalized imperative was announced by the Pythagoreans and  remained the overwhelming constant until  the present decade. Evariste Galois generalized symmetry in group theory in 1831, and  the  generalization was  finally  fully elaborated,  in  a  massive  collaborative  effort   to  complete  the   so-called “enormous theorem,” in the 1980s. The intuition of group theory – that things are the same no matter how you look at them – yields  a vast array  of possibilities.
