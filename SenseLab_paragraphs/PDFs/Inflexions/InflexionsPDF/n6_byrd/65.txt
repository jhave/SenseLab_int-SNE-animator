The macrocosm is understood in terms  of relativity theory;  the microcosm is understood in terms  of quantum physics. These  mechanisms of Pollock,  Olson, Coleman, Pynchon,  Rauschenberg,  and   Smithson  are  works   that   absorb   and saturate the mesocosm â€“ the data  site of creatures that are neither entirely mechanistic, like the cosmos,  nor  entirely random, like the binding forces of the atom.  The data  site comes  into  existence  with  questions of intent.  It is the forms of  non-statistical, asymmetrical  intent   that  are  to  be  explored in  the  present century.
