The humans – we  are  something else now  (I have  been  saying  “neoplasms”) – dealt,    or   tried    to   deal,   with    information  overload  by   generalizing.  The generalized concept, however, was both  lousy,  which  could  have  been managed, and  fatally  imprecise. The concept  was  so imprecise that  finally  everything was the   same    as   everything  else   –   all   was   one,   unified,   cosmological.  The generalization  made   the  thing   –  whatever,  justice,   a  hammer,  a  stone,   the constitution  of  a  state   –  into   conceptual mush, dangerously powerful and recklessly inclusive: the many  were  generalized until  all became  one. This unified conceptual  surface   was   beautiful  but   brittle   and   empty.  The   nested  and progressive  imprecisions,  shearing  off  the   ambiguity  of  the   thing   for   the crystalline sharpness  of  the  concept,   arrived at  an  inner-most core  so  finally general and  vague  that  the  trump concept  itself  – generalized difference is the same  – was  false. It was  so imprecise that  finally  life could  not be distinguished from  death. All of the  fundamental oppositions flickered. The final  picture was flat-out wrong.
