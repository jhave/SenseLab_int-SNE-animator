All of these  works,  including the  drip  paintings, are put  forth  as mechanisms – more  or less nihilistic – for the neutralization of the subject. We are the dark  spot that  nearly  obliterates the  thing  that  we  are  trying to  see.  The  more  common assumption is that  neutralization is enough: if the  ego  is dispensed with,  the
‘reality’ or ‘truth’ or some unnamed good  will flow through.
