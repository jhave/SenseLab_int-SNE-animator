Attention and  all  that  goes  with  it  – consciousness, representation,  language, history, culture, the object – are inherently deficient. There is nothing to attend to. We tell the child  “Pay  attention to that  object. Pay attention to your  mind.” It’s a death sentence. Sooner  or  later,  they  will  understand, at  least  in  some  vague sense,  that  the thing  and  their  minds are formally the same  thing,  the one thing, which  is self-cancelling, blank.
