Let me say this  differently. Disinterest is the  methodological prescription of the concept of life. Its form  arises  from  the symmetry of life and  death, which  negate and cancel one another. Life, however, changes; death does not. Tekhnē – art, engineering, architecure – is the  name  of the  discipline of intent.  Life is not  the exercise  of the  media;  it is not  a filling  in of the  coloring book  of form;  it is the intentional making of meaning.
