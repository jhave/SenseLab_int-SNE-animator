27.  Jan Kåhre’s  The Mathematical Theory of Information of 2002 is, I believe,  the most  important book  of  the  last  sixty  years.  It  gives  us  a  true  theory of information in  place  of Shannon’s theory of communication. Kåhre  shows that  no system  can communicate with  all of its parts.  Form  appears because information disappears. Matter   and  energy are  conserved;  information  is lost.  The  fragmentary forms  of  classical  reasons, logic,  mathematics, and aesthetics  appear  as  tools   in  our   tool   boxes   and   active   forms   of  our preadaptation appear on the data  site.
