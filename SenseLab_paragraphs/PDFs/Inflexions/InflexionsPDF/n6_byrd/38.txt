If all information were  preserved, we would be lost in the woods, overwhelmed by a thicket  of details.  We would not even  perceive the individual trees;  we could  not imagine the paths. The Law prescribes a haze  of blissful  ignorance and  oblivion, through which  we can see patterns emerge, patterns otherwise unseen” (2002: 20).
