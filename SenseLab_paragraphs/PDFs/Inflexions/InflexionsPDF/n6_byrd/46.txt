Attention  gives   way   to  intention.  Arakawa  and   Gins   speak   of  “informing intention.” We inform  the Earth,  and  it is our  purpose. Earth  is composed not of things but of purposes. Otherwise, creatures who  feed on knowing can only debilitate and   die.  Data  and   the  machines that   we  construct for  its  use  are nutrition. We are not  contained in sack of our  skins.  The city and  the  planetary system  are organs of our bodies.
