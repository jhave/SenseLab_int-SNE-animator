Quantifiable time operates through the has-been of experience in the mode  of time counted. Event-time is the feltness  of experience in the time-slip of the now. The difference: one is measured after the fact, one is felt in the nowness of lived experience. Choreography works  with  both. Quantifying the time of a movement allows  for repetition, the setting into sequence of a measurable component of movement technique. The paradox: the repetition will always be a re-creation in- time. Each repetition of a movement sequence will requalify the time of the
event:  the repetition will activate a new time-signature for the movementâ€™s
duration. Every return to the same will be a return to difference, a spiralling deviation into the multiplying time-slip that activates the now in the midst of many  thens.  No choreography is actually made  to measure.
