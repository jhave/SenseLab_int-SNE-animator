general and  thus  never  proposes a general state of affairs. Drop a curve! is aimed at the specificity of a configuring body,  a body  becoming cognizant of the potential of curving matter-form. It creates  a contrast in an ecological  sense: the body  positions spacetime differently, fielding the curving of spacetime in a new way. The contrast is felt through the creation of a new sensation which  now permeates the atmosphere which  is body/spacetime/movement. Propositions alter the affective  tonality of the event,  their participation in the event  akin to an immanent inclination in the conditions of its emergence (Whitehead, 1978: 194).
A choreographic proposition is a new concept for choreography because it
“alter[s]  the temporal condition of the ideas incumbent in the acts” (Forsythe,
2008: 7). The ideas incumbent in the acts are the immanent conditions for novelty. They are the idea-logics of the movements of thought that call forth the choreographic articulation. Ideas are eco-logical.  To repeat: they “do not insist on a single path  to form-of-thought” (2008: 5). They propose not an outcome in
itself, but a contrast. This contrast tweaks a persistent dynamic. The proposition
moves  us.
