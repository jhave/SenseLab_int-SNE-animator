Forsythe writes:  “Bodies in dance  are time machines, time is the exquisite product of the dancing body” (Forsythe, 2008: 111). In Forsythe’s work,  time- machines often stand-in as propositions for generating movement. Using both quantitative methods (clocks, watches, metronomes) and  qualitiative devices (varying the volume and melody of a voice while  counting, altering the duration and  rhythms of the counts),  Forsythe plays  with  the double time of movement. Working this way foregrounds both the additive and  the subtractive aspect  of movement: quantifiable time measures the spacetime of performance, creating a platform for repetition; qualitative time extrudes movement’s duration, creating an ecology of movement, space and time for lived experience. Foregrounding this doubling of future-pastness in alternate modes of counting time adds consistency to the experience and perception of moving. To move is to feel-with
the varying velocities  of time’s multiple rhythms. Time, moving us, moving time.
