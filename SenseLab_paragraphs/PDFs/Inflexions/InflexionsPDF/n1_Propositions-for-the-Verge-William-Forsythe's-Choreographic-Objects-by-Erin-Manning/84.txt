An incipient tendency toward taking  a step is felt as a walk when the divergent metastabilities congeal  into a singularity â€“ a decisive  turn.  The flow of the walk now feels less like a stepping than  a moving horizontality. Yet this horizontality, like the steps themselves, is composed of an infinity of microtendencies toward verticality, the most obvious being the verticality of the body itself in relation to the horizontal ground across which  it moves.  The walk: an almost-falling verticality transduced into an inclination for horizontality.
