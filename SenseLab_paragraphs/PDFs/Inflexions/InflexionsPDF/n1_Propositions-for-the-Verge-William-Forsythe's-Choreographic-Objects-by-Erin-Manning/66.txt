Movement never  stops.  Every movement resonates with  its incipient preacceleration and its potential surplus or remainder, active in a contagion of speeds and slownesses. A ‘first’ movement is not ‘the beginning’. It is the activation of a differing velocity.  Take a dynamic jump.  Your preparation for the movement already carries within its posture the movement leading up to it and the immanent complexity of all the potential movement articulations activating your  corpuscular universe. Most of these tendencies will fall away  when you jump  – the specificity of the movement at hand requires that only jump- derivative configurations of proprioceptive, muscular and thought processes be active. These jump-specific preaccelerations will incite the materialization of a fusing-together of jump  potential before you actually leave the ground: you will already experience an inclination to move – a virtual interval on the verge  of actualization – that sets the stage for the displacement to take place. [16] In this inclination toward jumping – the jump’s preacceleration – there will already be a feeling of shifting ground as well as a pre-feeling of a landing site (Arakawa and Gins, 2002). This landing site is less a point  in space than  what  Deleuze calls a
‘decisive turn’ (Deleuze, 1988: 27)). You are jumping not toward an actual  site. You are preaccelerating into an evolution of site that immanently alters the very quality of taking off. The jump is less a jump-as-such than  a dynamic co- experiencing of varying velocities  in preacceleration and  extension.
