“You don’t need  a choreographer to dance.” [35] What you need  is a proposition. Propositions are ontogenetic: they emerge as the germ  of the occasion  and persist on the nexus  of experience to take hold once more  through new occasions of experience. Forsythe’s choreographic objects are propositions in just this sense.
