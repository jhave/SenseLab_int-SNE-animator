Diagrammatic propositions invest  in what  Gilles Deleuze, following Michel Foucault, calls the “thought of the outside.” This concept of the outside must  not be placed in a dichotomous relation with  a putative inside.  The outside refers to forces “that  we might  understand as the roiling  and threatening forces of chaos” (Deleuze, 1986: 43). The outside is the force field of potential from which  actual occasions are subtracted, the more-than of the less-than of lived  experience. The Frankfurt Ballet’s diagrammatic propositions capture the prearticulations of these forces, flirting  with  their potential, activating choreographic practice toward the as yet unthought-for-experimentation. The diagrams are not descriptive of a process  to be followed. They are transductive: they call forth jumps  in register, inciting  new processes at each juncture – from writing to movement, from fold to flight. Folding techniques for the paper do not simply translate into folding techniques for the body.  They create potential biograms – affective  openings for the transformation of a body  in process.  To do this, the diagrammatic fold itself must  first take on resonance, find its experiential force
within the composition at hand. Through a tight  interweaving of divergent forms
of process, what  ensues is the individuation of a becoming-event spurred by the superimposition of paper-times and movement-folds transduced into the unfolding biogram of movement composition.
