Such everyday choreographies highlight autonomous expressions of movement in the making, but are not necessarily creative of new opportunities. In a habitual environment, contrast is generally understated: the status-quo tends to delimit
the range  of potential experience. Creative autonomous opportunities are more
likely to happen when an event  alters how you experience space. You may decide to paint  the room,  taking  out the furniture, only to realize  that the orientation you’ve always taken  in the space is not the most interesting one. It’s not the objects that have kept you from attending to spacetimes of creation in this particular environment. It’s that you forgot  that objects have a life, that they create space. And that how the space moves  you is synonymous with  the eventness of its objects. In redecorating the room,  perhaps you begin to pay more attention to how the objects create space, not simply how they configure an already existing  spacetime of experience. Objects are not stable: they forecast  the time of an event.  ‘The choreographic object: a model  of potential transition from one state to another in any space imaginable’ (Forsythe, 2008: 6).
