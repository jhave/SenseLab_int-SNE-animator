memory. When we watch  a dancer move,  the movement perceived is already the memory of the previous movement coursing through it. Each movement is alive with  a memory that activates the becoming-body. [17] This activation is not a memory of an actual  movement: we wouldnâ€™t have time remember a movement and  move/perceive at the same time. The memory is a force of activation and stabilization ensconced in the presentness of discovering the feeling of
movement again  for the first time.
