Take Scattered Crowd (2002). [36] This choreographic object involves four
thousand white  balloons suspended in a wash  of sound. The balloons themselves are not the proposition. The proposition is expressed through their uncanny volume and its contribution to the creation of singular spacetimes of experimentation. Scattered Crowd is about  moving-through quality – whiteness, airiness, lightness – such that the co-constituting spacetime of experience
becomes  a moving-with: relational environment invites  relational movement
creates  ecology of event.
