[9] Time-signatures as I am using  them  here have nothing to do with  the ways they are used  in musical scores. In musical scoring,  a time-signature refers to the numerical sign placed at the beginning of a piece of music,  or during the course of it, to indicate the meter  of the piece. In this case, the time-signature helps to determine the number of beats to a measure. Here, I use time-signature as a means of conceiving the singularity of time in a becoming-actual of its duration.
