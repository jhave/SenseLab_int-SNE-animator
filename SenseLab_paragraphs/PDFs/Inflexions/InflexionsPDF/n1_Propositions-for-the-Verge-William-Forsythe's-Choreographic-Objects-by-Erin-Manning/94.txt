Choreographyâ€™s ecology  is rhythmical. Choreography is composed of an infinity of slightly varying velocities,  vibrations, sensations. These qualities are in and  of matter, active in the transduction from force to form. These individuating qualities give specificity to the environment, inflecting the ways bodies  move with  and  through it. The movement in turn  creates  time-volumes that populate the co-configuring atmosphere. Choreography, as Forsythe emphasizes, is not strictly  about  human bodies.  It is about  the creation of spacetimes of experience.
