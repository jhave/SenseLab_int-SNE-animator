[2] For Deleuze, thought is always of the body,  in movement. He writes:  “Do not count  upon thought to ensure the relative necessity of what  it thinks. Rather, count  upon the contingency of an encounter with  that which  forces thought to raise up and  educate the absolute necessity of an act of thought or a passion to think.  […] Something in the world forces us to think” (Deleuze, 1994: 139). “It is true  that on the path  which  leads to that which  is to be thought, all begins  with sensibility. Between  the intensive and  thought, it is always by means of an intensity that thought comes to us” (1994: 144).
