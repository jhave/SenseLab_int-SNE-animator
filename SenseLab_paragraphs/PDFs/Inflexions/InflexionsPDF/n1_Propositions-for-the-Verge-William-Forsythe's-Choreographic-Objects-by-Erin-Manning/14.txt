Forsythes’s choreographic process creates  conditions for events.  When an object becomes  the attractor for the event,  it in-gathers the event  toward the object’s dynamic capacity for reconfiguring spacetimes of composition. Forsythe’s choreographic objects tend  to find one of their points of departure in the form of an everyday object: a balloon,  a piece of cardboard, a castle. These “objects”  are always part of an evolving ecosystem in Forsythe’s work.  They extend beyond their  objectness to become  ecologies  for complex  environments that propose dynamic constellations of space, time and movement. These “objects”  are in fact propositions co-constituted by the environments they make possible. They urge participation. Through the objects, spacetime takes on a resonance, a singularity: it becomes  bouncy, it floats, it shadows. The object becomes  a missile for experience that inflects a given  spacetime with  a spirit  of experimentation. We could  call these objects ‘choreographic objectiles’ to bring  to them  the sense of incipient movement their dynamic participation within the relational environment calls forth.
