Nik Hafner, a former dancer for the Frankfurt Ballet, discusses the overlapping use of metric  and durational time in Forsythe’s choreographic process:  “In William Forsythe’s pieces, we continuously find people or objects that mark  time and  remind us of the time-duration of their structures: watches, counters, step- makers” (Hafner, 2004: 133). What strikes  Hafner is that despite the use of many instruments for quantifiable measure, Forsythe’s interest seems  to lie less in the measurability of time (and  the body’s coordination to that measure) than  in “events that are, given  their timely  complexity, unreproducible” (2004: 135). Forsythe’s experimentation with  the time of movement is diagrammatic. Rather than  simply treating quantified time as the organising node  for choreography’s expression, he urges  his dancers to become  flexible in different time zones.  He suggests, for instance, that they create diagrams for the superimposition of different experiences of time, both measured and  durational. These diagrams can begin with  something as simple  as a schedule that corresponds to “precise spaces on the stage as well as further information about  the kind  of height-level (low/middle/high) of the improvisation” to end up as multi-layered drawings and  foldings that convey  how measure and duration coexist in the activity  of creating bodies  of time (2004:136).
