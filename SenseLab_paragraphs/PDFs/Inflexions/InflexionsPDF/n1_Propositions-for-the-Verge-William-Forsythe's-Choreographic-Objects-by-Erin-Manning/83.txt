The walk becomes  a habitual movement through the memory of having walked. We feel the more-than of its habitualness when we suddenly canâ€™t right
ourselves. A sore ankle takes the habit out of the walk.  We find we have to tweak the metastabilities of our incipient movement toward new angles  of comfort.  But soon we get the hang  of it and before we know  it, the walk is walking us once more.
