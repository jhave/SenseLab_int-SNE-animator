In fact we have never  been stable. To walk is to move  with  perception and its continual activation of a million  stabilities and  instabilities, rightings and unbalancings. Without the interweaving of the past in the present, we couldn’t simply get up and walk – each walking would have to be a relearning of moving through the tiny disjunctive equilibriums we call balance.
