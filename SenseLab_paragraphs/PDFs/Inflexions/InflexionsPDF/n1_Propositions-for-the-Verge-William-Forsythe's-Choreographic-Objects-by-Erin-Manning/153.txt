[25] Whitehead defines the nexus: “a nexus is a set of actual  entities  in the unity of the relatedness constituted by their prehensions of each other,  or what  is the same thing  conversely expressed constituted by their objectifications in each other” (Whitehead, 1978: 35). (double check page number: it does not coincide with  my 1978 edition)
