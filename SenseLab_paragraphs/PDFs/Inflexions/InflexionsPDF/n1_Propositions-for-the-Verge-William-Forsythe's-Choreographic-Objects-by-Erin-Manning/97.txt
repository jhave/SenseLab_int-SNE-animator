Whitehead writes:  “There  is a becoming of continuity, but no continuity of becoming” (Whitehead, 1978: 35). A proposition calls forth a becoming of continuity even while it resists  the continuity of becoming. Embedded in the actual occasion  and  immanent to its unfolding, propositions call forth a tendency within the occasion  to open itself toward a singularity of expression. Once admitted into experience, there is no longer  becoming: the event is absolutely what it has become.
