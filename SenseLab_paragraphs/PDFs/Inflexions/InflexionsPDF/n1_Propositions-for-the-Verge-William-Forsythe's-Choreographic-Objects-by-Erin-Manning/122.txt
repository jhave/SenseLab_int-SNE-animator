For Scattered Crowd how the roomâ€™s volume evolves  is synonymous with  the constituting of event-time. The changing of the affective tone of spacetime is not willed  by individual participants. It happens in a relational becoming: the room moves  the participants to alter the composition of event-time. Here  we see precision of proposition meeting unpredictability of event.  To achieve  a singularity of experience, the enabling constraints immanent to the proposition have to be both concise and  open-ended. When  it works,  the whole  atmosphere is moved.
