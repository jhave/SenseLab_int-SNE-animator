We cannot  know  extension as such, and yet extension underlies each of our perceptions. It is an infinite  relational network of potential through which singularities emerge. It does not connote a before or beyond of experience. It is closer to an outside in the Deleuzian/Foucauldian sense – a force field for experience’s experimentation in the now. In actualization, each singularity is independent of all other  singularities yet virtually interconnected with  the force of becoming-event. Thus each singularity is intrinsically connected to the web of potential which  modulates its taking-form. Form and force, infinitely co-arising.
