As an audience, we also experience movement’s contrast more  than  its taking- form. When the dancer raises her arm, we see not the raising but the having-been raised,  and even then, if it was quick, we are not quite  sure: was it really an arm raised  or was it a jump?  We feel the resonance of the microexpressions of movement in the creation of difference. This experience of contrast is felt through the perception of how the echo of a remainder that is the incipience of the movement passing wells into the singularity of the next event.  At dancing’s best, this verging on the new is felt intensively, transforming a series of steps  into an ecology  of experience. If captivated, we become  participants in event-time.
