For Forsythe’s dancers, diagrams are generative propositions for the activation of folds of time at the intersection of duration and  measure. A diagrammatic approach is useful  for registering the complexity of co-constitutive spacetimes of experience and  expression. Dana Casperson, long-standing dancer with  the Frankfurt Ballet and the Forsythe Company explains: “Bill’s dancing is extremely complex and  organic, and  the key to understanding how to do his choreography lies in figuring out which  points on his body are initiating movement and  which are responding to the initiation” (Casperson, 2000: 27). These quick transitions between micromovements are like “refractions [of] light bounding between surfaces” (2000: 27).
