We took sheets  of transparent paper, drew shapes on them,  and cut geometric forms into them  which  we folded back to create a 3D surface  that could  reveal  surfaces underneath. We layered this on top of the book page, a flattened projection of the Laban cube, and a computer generated list of times organized into geometric shapes (created by David  Kern and Bill). Then we photocopied it. We then drew simple  geometric forms onto these copies and  repeated the whole  process  until  we had  a layered document. We used  this document first to generate movement (Casperson, 2000: 28, image  below  p. 29)
