“reconfigure the habit,  move  through contrast.” If you tend  to drop through your side, creating a curve  from hip to shoulder, begin there.  But go elsewhere with it. Put eyes in the back of your  head  and find yourself curving from back to knee. You might  mistake this for a simple  demand. You might  think  it’s an option. Do this or do that.
