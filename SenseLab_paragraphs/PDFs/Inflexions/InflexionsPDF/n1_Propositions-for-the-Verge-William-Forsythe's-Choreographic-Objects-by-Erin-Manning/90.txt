Memory is visionary in the sense of foresight: a seeing-with-before. Moving someone else’s moving while you’re watching them  move  is like feeling future movement. You are moving with  the incipient future (the always nextness of movement) in the present passing. This is recollection at work.  Recollecting is moving the future (the thought becoming memory) through the past in the present. Forsythe calls the experimentation with  this recollection-in-movement dancing with  “a cloud  of form,”  and  describes it as a proprioceptive gathering of tendencies not actually reproduced but reactivated such that they can take form in relation to their already having taken  place. Recollecting produces future memory, it creates  visions  for movement. Lived experience is the experience of fielding this visionariness of experience. Key to becoming visionary is to move through remarkable points, to catch decisive turns in the making.
