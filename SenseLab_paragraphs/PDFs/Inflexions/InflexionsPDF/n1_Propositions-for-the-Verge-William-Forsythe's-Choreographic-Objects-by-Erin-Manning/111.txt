Verging  on the continuum is a proposition for rhythmic duration. In this process of narrowing through rhythm, an event  takes form through a divisional turn  that cuts duration. The rhythm of an event’s taking form is replete with  extensity and intensity. The continuum pervades it and it pervades the continuum. But in the time of the event’s actualization it becomes  ‘this singular rhythm’. We feel the event  not through the infinity of the continuum but in the time of its rhythm.
This rhythm is an ecology: it partakes of the infinite  potential of all the durations
that might  have gathered into this expression of singularity. But it is strictly  this singular time-signature – a sonorous relational matrix  of the here and  now. This rhythm of the here and now is ecological  because it carries  within its taking-form the unrealized expressions of all the times of its making. It carries  them  not as decisions to exclude, but as propositions for the verge.
