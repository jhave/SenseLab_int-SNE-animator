The extensive continuum is more vague. It is the withness of the vastness of durational plenitude. Singular movement develops out of this extensive continuum, emergent in relation to all of the micropotentialities of pastness and futurity that make  up an event.  “This extensive continuum is one relational complex in which  all potential objectifications find their  niche. It underlies the whole  world, past, present and future” (Whitehead, 1978: 65).
