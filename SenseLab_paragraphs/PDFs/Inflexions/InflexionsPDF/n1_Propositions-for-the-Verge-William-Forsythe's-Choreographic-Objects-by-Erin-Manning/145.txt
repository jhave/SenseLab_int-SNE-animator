[16] I develop the concept of preacceleration in a piece entitled “Incipient Action: The Dance of the Not-Yet”  in Relationscapes. In this piece, the concept  of preacceleration emerges through the question of how a movement can be felt relationally when two people move  together. In order for the movement to be activated in the togetherness of a ‘now’, the relation itself has to be moved. For this to happen, a preacceleration of the movement must  be felt. This kind  of dynamic is keenly  felt in Argentine Tango, which  builds on improvised deviations of the walk.
