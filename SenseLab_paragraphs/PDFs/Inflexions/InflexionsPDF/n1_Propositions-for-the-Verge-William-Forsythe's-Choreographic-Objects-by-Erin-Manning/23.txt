This is how the choreographic object works.  Think of entering a room  replete with mirrors that look like tables, reflecting a bright red floor (The Defenders, Part
2, 2008). [6] You enter  the pace perhaps a little nervously – events  that demand participation can be stressful. You move  cautiously, aware of your  approach. Then, through the corner  of your  eye, you catch a different quality of movement: someone is having fun! You half turn  your attention to the quality of ‘having fun’ and  before you know  it, your  posture has shifted. You’re tending toward the fun. This movement-with becomes  the initiating gesture toward the time of the event the choreographic object proposes. You suddenly no longer  feel the pressure of a demand: if you did, you wouldn’t be so quick to move.  You feel the event’s proposition. The proposition is felt as an invitation to experiment within the bounds of an ecology  of practice that itself makes  time felt. The choreographic object does this by bringing together the pastness of experience the objects evoke within the new constellation of event  time. When  an object no longer  seems to be quite  what  you thought it was and the experience of time no longer  feels as
linear,  it’s because the event is beginning to take over. No longer  as concerned
with  your  ‘self’, you are now experiencing the potential of the future mixed  in with  the resonance of the past: a futurity of pastness in the present. Play.
