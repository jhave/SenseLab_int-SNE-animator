Contrast is akin to creative advance. To have felt a body  developing beyond what you thought a body could  do is to know-feel its differing. This differing is stimulated by a movement-generating proposition, now alive on the nexus  of the embodiment of lived  experience. From actual to potential, from occasion  to
nexus  of experience, propositions are potentials for future feeling.
