Forsythe asks: ‘is it possible for choreography to generate autonomous expressions of its principals, a choreographic object, without the body?’ (Forsythe, 2008: 5). Choreography happens everywhere, all the time. The setting up of a room  for the enjoyment of a household involves the creation of a movement constellation. It crafts opportunities for moving-through, creates invitations for sitting-with, provides incentive for getting-there-first. It forecasts an ideal place-taking: the perfect  chair, the best view, the closest comfort.  And it creates  opportunities for difference: you can walk around the chair, dance  on the
couch, sleep under the television. Chances are, though, that your  movements will
take the space-as-is for granted, that you will return to the comfort  of the position you prefer  each time, that in time you will realize  there are whole  areas  of the room  you never  really attend to. Habits set in. Even the cat is always in the same place. The space moves  you in a way that does not force you to think. [2]
