Diagrammatic praxis  works  with  ontogenetic prearticulations of co-existent tendencies overlapping toward the creation of new vectors.  [13] In the case of the process of creating diagrams for movement exploration, these ontogenetic tendencies are also biogrammatic: of the becoming-body. [14] Sher Doruff explains: “the biogrammatic is synergetic with what  might  be called diagrammatic praxis and  can be considered ontogenetic to performing arts practice as it emphasizes the experience of practice becoming perception through differential relations” (Doruff,  2008: 16).
