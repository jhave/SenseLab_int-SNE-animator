For a feeling to feel, contrast must  be registered: “admission of the selected elements in the lure, as felt contraries, primarily generates purpose” (Whitehead,
1938: 188). This registering is not necessarily conscious. “A felt “contrary” is consciousness in germ”  (1938: 188). Consciousness is on the verge of registering the feeling felt when the now and  the now become  differentiable. “Our sense of time, like other  senses,  seems subject to the law of contrast” (James, 1890: 618). Even the experience of the living room  holds  contrast in germ in a readyness to activate the habit  of the everyday. Contrast underlies every here and  now.
