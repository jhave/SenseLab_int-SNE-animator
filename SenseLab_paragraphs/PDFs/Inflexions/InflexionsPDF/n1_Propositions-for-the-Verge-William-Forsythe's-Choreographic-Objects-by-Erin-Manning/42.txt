The time of the event is propositional. Propositions are alive in the relational now of experience even as they extend beyond their nowness to participate in occasions to come. They are renewable as qualities for relational experience, even as they are singular in their present iteration. Propositions vacillate  between actual and  virtual time. On the one hand, their effects are felt in the specious present’s “vaguely vanishing backward and forward fringe”  (James, 1890: 613). On the other,  they make felt the uncanniness of experience’s thresholds: “A succession of feelings,  in and of itself, is not a feeling of succession” (1890: 628).
Through the proposition, we feel the force of the clinching of the event  as the
nowness of the with-then of experience. [8]
