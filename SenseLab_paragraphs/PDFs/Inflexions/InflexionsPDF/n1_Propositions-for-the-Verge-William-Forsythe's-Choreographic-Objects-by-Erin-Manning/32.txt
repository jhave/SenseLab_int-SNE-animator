This time-slip of experience, felt as ‘now’ because contrasted from ‘then’, is propositional when experience registers as feeling.  You can curve  all you want, but only when  you curve  in a way that transforms how you move  will the curve have become  a proposition for a moving body.  As Whitehead repeats: “the proposition constitutes what  the feeling has felt” (Whitehead, 1978: 186).
