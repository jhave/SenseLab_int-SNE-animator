Like his choreographies, Forsythe’s choreographic objects are created with  very precise  immanent conditions for movement: they insist on the precision of parameters for movement without divesting the movement of its potential for eventness. They are unforeseeable in their effects yet carefully crafted toward participation. They are objectiles thrown into the world, invitations to move- with. Forsythe speaks of seeking physical solutions to dramaturgic propositions. [33] The choreographic objects are designed to provoke physical solutions that tend  toward habit even as they divert us toward the contrast of the new. This new emerges relationally, activated by propositions embedded into the choreographic objects’ potential deployment. These act not on individual will: they move  the relation.
