Proposition: Drop a Curve. Glance into the living  room. Note the single empty space on the couch. Feel the shift in equilibrium as your body  begins  to curve toward sit-ability. Take the tendency to curve  and  shift it into a walking feeling. Even as you walk by the living room, feel the curving potential of couching.
