The speciousness of the present is due  to the disjunction between experience and the consciousness of experience. What we experience as now is already being infested with  a new ‘now’, this new now already slightly altering the experience of the last experience of now. Choreographic objects draw out this paradox of the linearity of measured time versus the duration of experiential time. “The practically cognized present is no knife-edge, but a saddle-back, with  a certain breadth of its own on which  we sit perched, and  from which we look in two directions into time”  (William  James, 1890: 609). The time-slip the choreographic object makes  felt calls forth the additive and  the subtractive aspect  of experience. The time of the event is experienced as more-than what  was before even as it is less-than what  it could  have been. Future and past entwined in a fabulous experience of the not-quite-now.
