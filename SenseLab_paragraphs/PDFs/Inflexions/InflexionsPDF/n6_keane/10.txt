The   integration   of   an    inclusive   experimental   architectural   approach   to knowledge with  existing  social, educational and  political  processes would create new  links  across  (the  creative arts)  disciplines and  methodologies and  address the disconnection between common areas  of research in the life sciences, developmental  psychology,  rehabilitation  science,   and   blended learning and creativity. It is crucial  to note that  Arakawa and  Gins investigate the body- environment relationship by producing situations that  dismantle and  allow reconfiguration of sensing, perception and  comprehension. This approach could productively fold  back  and  inform  the  way  in which  an  experimental teaching space  is  presented, funded and  built  within the  context  of  institutions in  the public  sector, such as universities.
