When  meeting with   key  persons in  the  university, I  proposed the  idea  that Arakawa and  Gins  be  commissioned to  design the  architectural procedures that would be enacted and  implemented as the structure of the environment and  the structure of the  curriculum of the  ongoing experimental space.  The  reception from  university administration was  varied. The  ideas  were  applauded but  the practicalities of money and  the unknown outcomes were  seen as problematic. In my discussions with  Arakawa and  Gins, they were open  to the idea of producing any number of possible options that  could  be realised at different scales:  from  a stand-alone  building, to  a  selected   room,   to  individual  architectural features within a designated built  environment. They  would design the  space  or would be willing  to design the  procedure that  we would enact.  The possibility that  an experimental  space   might    begin   with   Arakawa  and   Gins   constructing  a particular design that  would become  a launching pad  through which  to explore procedural approaches gained more  traction and  led  to  a  modification of the project.
