Although desirable, it is not possible to wait  for Arakawa and  Gins to come to a town  near  you  and  build  procedural architecture. We must  take  on the ethos  of this task with  the guidance of those  who have  dedicated 40 years  researching the body-environment as The Mechanism of Meaning.  Using  architecture to increase human  capacity by  finding practical, sustainable  and  viable  ways  of implementing  resources  is  the   key   to   activating procedural knowing and perceptual learning. Educational institutions (particularly higher education) can play   a   leading  role   in   the   reconfiguration  of  knowledge acquisition and production by reabsorbing research and  research findings generated by higher learning institutions and  applying them  to the objectives  of university planning and the universityâ€™s impact upon cultural development.
