When integrated with  current findings on brain  plasticity, enriched environments (e.g.  from   rehabilitation  and   treatment  of  stroke,   aphasia  and   autism) and education approaches to holistic  learning environments (e.g. Steiner  and  others), Arakawa and   Gins  pre-empt the  remedial (e.g.  they  are  not  trying to  fix  a disability) by  placing emphasis on  capacity-building from  the  outset. In many ways  procedural architecture might  be described as the  production of enriched environment that  allow  us  to  pre-adapt or  adapt in  advance of situations and environment that may arise.
