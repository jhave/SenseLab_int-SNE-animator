The meetings over a two-year period between 2008 and  2010 gravitated towards considering  common-use spaces   (lecture   hall,  tutorial room,  computer lab  or foyer space) that  would fall within the Library  and  Learning Services brief, reclassifying the  building project  as a refurbishment. A separate option was  to align  the  project  with  the  design for  the  new  hospital’s common-use learning centre.  The strategy to make  a high-profile experimental teaching space  would make  it more  attractive to the  educational initiatives of the  Pro-Vice  Chancellor of the faculty  group or other  members of the university executive. The need  to re- scale  the  teaching space  proposal into  an  existing  space  designated for refurbishment meant that  the scope of the experimental teaching space was recalibrated to a small-scale project that  may  lead  to other  building ventures at  a larger  scale  in  future. In  line  with  Arakawa and  Gins’  open  brief,  they  could either  design one or more architectural procedures (instructions for  the  invention and  assembly of procedures and  procedural architecture/architectural features) or design and  oversee the  construction of the  first  iteration of a teaching space which    would   then    be   handed   over    to    university   staff    for    particular investigations.
