Arakawa and  Gins  provide the  most  inclusive and  radically practical approach for  understanding and  transforming activities that  have  become  the  subject  of myriad studies and  the purview of educational institutions and  administrations. The “disconnect” between the research and  learning in addition to trends in University  planning  can   be  addressed  when  one   considers  current  higher learning agendas for integrating research, blended learning and  work-related learning. Smart  classrooms should not only be driven by technology but  also by advances in our  understanding of the  embodied conditions of learning. To that end,   the   emphasis  on   experiential  perception-based  learning  is  addressed directly  by   the   experimental  approach  of  Arakawa  and   Gins.   Their   work advocates and  demonstrates the  importance and  the  benefits  of integrating the learning environment, the mode  of inquiry and  the issue under investigation. Arakawa and  Gins’  built  works  and  theoretical discourse provide the  tools  by which  integrated teaching and  learning environment could  be incorporated into university plans  and objectives.
