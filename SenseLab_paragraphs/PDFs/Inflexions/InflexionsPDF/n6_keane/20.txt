To that  end,  I met  with  the person in charge  of building and  refurbishment  (at Griffith),  the director of Library  and  Learning Services  to find  a suitable site for an experimental teaching space. The task was to arrive  at a viable concept, implementation plan,  funding structure and  operating plan  for users  and stakeholders  across   the   university  that   was   also   attractive  to  international scholars,  the   international  student  community  and   the   local   community.   I submitted documents that  put  forward the  benefits  of building an efficient  and sustainable learning environment that  is consistent with  the university’s policies on   work-integrated  learning  and   the   research  centres’   priorities  in  Health, Cultural Sociology and the Arts and Humanities.
