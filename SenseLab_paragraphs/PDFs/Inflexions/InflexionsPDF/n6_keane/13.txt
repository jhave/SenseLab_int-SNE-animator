Many  researchers and  practitioners currently teaching at  universities use  the works  of Arakawa and Gins within their courses and some go as far as structuring entire  courses on their  work.  This includes scholar-practitioners involved in AG3 online  who  have  designed university courses, explicitly  and  implicitly, around Arakawa and  Ginsâ€™ work.  Alan  Prohm, whose  year-long courses at MA and  BA levels  are  perhaps the  strongest example of coursework informed by Arakawa and  Gins.  Other  examples include Gordon Bearn  at  Lehigh  University, Aaron Levy at University of Pennsylvania (co-organizer of the second international AG conference),  Bill  Lavender at  University of  New   Orleans, Russell  Hughes at RMIT now  at Bond University, and  myself,  previously at Griffith  University and currently at  Deakin  University (where the  Phoenix Gallery  has  become  a lab- event  space  with  the potential for architectural transformation). In order to take this further, the connection of scholarship to research (especially practice-led research) and  teaching must  now  be plugged into the higher-level infrastructure of university planning.   To maximize the  benefits  to  students, and  their  post- graduate lives as cultural practitioners, the environment needs  to be considered from  the  start  as the  ground from  which  communication and  learning activity emerge:  site-conditioned capacity building.
