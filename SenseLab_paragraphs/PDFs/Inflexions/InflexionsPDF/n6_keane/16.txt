Arakawa and  Gins procedural architecture offer a key to understanding how architectural features are produced, deployed and maintained at every level of activity and processing within  and across the  body-environment  relationship. The  practical considerations that   follow   are  an  attempt to  find  the  most   effective  way  to implement and  build  an experimental teaching space within the frameworks of a university system  under pressure in a competitive world measured, in part,  by student outcomes. The twist  that  emerged through my  attempt to facilitate  the building of an  experimental teaching space  in  the  ever-changing conditions of the  university was  to propose to have  the  teaching space  become  a constantly changing environment (literally always in-the-process-of-being-built). To enable this  process,  I proposed that  the  university commission Arakawa and  Gins  to produce architectural procedures for staff and student researchers to enact.
