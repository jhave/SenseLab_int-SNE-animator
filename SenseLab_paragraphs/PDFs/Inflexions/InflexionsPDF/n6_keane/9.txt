technologically driven smart  spaces.  The objectives  of smart-space technologies focus on communication and  the accessibility and  delivery of information as part of a multi-media approach. Procedural architecture expands the  idea  of multi- media to consider any  object, whether a chair,  an artwork, a door,  a monitor, a database or a memory, to be considered as part  of one’s immediate environment. Perceptual  learning  is  how   we  come  to  know   the  connections among  these variously configured sites  to  develop a  “sited   awareness” (2002: 7) that  may become  ongoing “daily  research” (95).
