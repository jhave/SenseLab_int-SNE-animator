A  trial  period of  two  or  three  years  might   be  proposed to  faculties,   external sponsors and  community stakeholders for the supply of materials. In contrast to the  budget  for  constructing  a  standalone  structure,  refurbishment  costs  are minimal.  Staffing   costs,  workload  allocation  and   integration  into   university curricula as well as management and  administration of the space  would require a member of the  permanent staff  and  subsequently interested researchers from any cognate field. Teaching commitments would need  to be adjusted and  would vary according to interest and  availability. The task for anyone taking  on the directorship of  the  space   would be  to  coordinate  the  teaching  and   learning activities, maintain and  find  new  partnerships within the  university, across  the local sector and  internationally to attract visiting scholar-practitioners to develop new  uses  for  the  experimental teaching space  and  the  communities of users  it would attract.
