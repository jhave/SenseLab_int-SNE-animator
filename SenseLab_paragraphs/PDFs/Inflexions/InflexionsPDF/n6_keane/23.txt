In each institution there  are particular lines of influence that  lead to building architectural projects.    The  initial  discussions I had  at  Griffith  were  with  the director of Library  and  Learning Services, the Faculty  Dean of Arts, an Executive officer from  Centre for Medicine and  Oral  Health, former and  current Heads of the  School of Arts,  and  members of Griffith  Works  Committee. The aim  was  to meet  with  key  persons in charge  of building projects  and  facilities,  to see if an experimental teaching space  designed by  Arakawa and  Gins  was  viable.  The crucial  factors  in finding a suitable location  or type  of facility  was  to convince and  align  the  project  with  progressive key  persons strategically positioned to designate  spaces   and   initiate  building  projects.   This   crucial   factor   would influence  the  development  of  a  costing   structure  and   the  investment-return scenario  that   the   stakeholders,  such   as  the   Deputy  Dean   of  Teaching and Learning, Pro-Vice  Chancellor of Learning and  Student Outcomes, the  Pro-Vice Chancellor Art,  Education and  Law  and  the  Deputy Vice Chancellor Academic, would need  to consider. With the proposal of each different possible location,  the constellation  of  stakeholders  and   key  persons  changed  since   each   space   is associated  with   different  areas   of  the  institution  that   have   different interpretations of  national, state  and  university priorities and  the  trends that direct  changes in priorities.
