The  project’s  added flexibility  (in  design and  scale)  meant that  the  university only  needed to  provide a shell space similar  to  a theatre space  that  is ready to accommodate a number of stage designs, or a sound stage that can accommodate film  sets  or  a  lab  or  gym  space   that   can  be  fitted   with   elaborate  specialist equipment. The  shell  space  could  be a flexible  space  and  outfitted with  power suited  for   typical   blended  learning  technologies  such   as  a  sound  system, structural  walls,  floor  and   ceiling  that   can  support  constructed architectural features (e.g. structural and  elaborate cabinetry). Because the space would be designed for flexible delivery, there  could  be supposition from  the start  that  the space would undergo several  iterations that could  be anticipated and  included in the  initial  design. In  this  way  the  experimental teaching space  would remain informed  by   Arakawa  and   Gins’   work   enacting  procedures  that   undergo constant re-construction.
