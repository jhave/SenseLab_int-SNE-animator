The  great  potential of Arakawa and  Gins’  procedural architecture through its capacity for comprehensive integration to inform  new approaches to education is yet to be fully explored. Procedural architecture is a process-oriented approach to the  way  the  environment and  the  body  mutually form  and  extend each  other. The procedures are  ways  of focusing the  use  of architecture/built environment as a hypothesis for questioning (searching and  researching) all possible ways  to observe the body-environment interaction in order to transform it. The reversible destiny  project   is  comprehensive  or   inclusive  in   that   Arakawa  and   Gins constantly  look  to  what   is  outside  the  purview  of  any   given   discipline  or approach to coordinate and  optimise how  we  acquire knowledge and  what  we consider to be knowledge. Example of their  architectural procedure are the “tentative constructing towards a holding in place”  (Gins and  Arakawa 2002: 48) and  the   “disperse to contrast” (75) procedures, which  are  ways  to think  about and   approach the  building  of  architectural  features.  They  go  on  to  say  “in studying so  tenuous and  elusive   an  event-fabric as  bioscleave [the  continual joining  and  separating process  of the biosphere], the making of cut-and-dried separations,  such   as  distinguishing  between  subject   and   object,   should  be avoided” which  characterizes their procedural approach (48, 49).
