A procedural approach has a few important potential consequences for education. First,   the   complexity  required   to   enrich    learning  must    be   coupled  with recognition of  multiple embodied and   disciplinary perspectives deregulating what  counts as  intelligence, knowledge or  information. Second,  Arakawa and Gins insist  that  research should be conducted “not  in a library  or laboratory but where living  happens” (2002: xxi) enabling the complexity of relationships to be studied within and  across  the “organism-person-environment” (1). Third, procedurally constructed environments are primarily concerned with  the transformation  of  human  capacity, inviting further  action   and   applying  the findings of scientific study to the history of the body.  The role of architecture as a tool for researching the body-environment towards the implementation of these considerations is paramount.
