I  began   to  construct  a  rationale  to  present  to  university  stakeholders.  The rationale gathered together a set of ideas  and  arguments, starting with  the notion that  Teaching and  Learning environments could  take  full  advantage of current research from  the life sciences,  developmental psychology, rehabilitation science and  blended learning to thereby strengthen the links between curriculum development, research based  teaching and  the  enriched learning environments consistent with  principles of interdisciplinary enquiry and  cultural leadership. Building an experimental teaching space would demonstrate an ongoing commitment to excellence,  innovation and  the importance of connecting existing research  with    the   spaces    in   which    learning  is   conducted.  While   smart environments that  are  technologically driven are  crucial  to communication and delivery of  information, spaces  that  recognise the  multi-modal, multi-sensory and  multiple intelligences of students would expand learning possibilities and capacity-building experiences exponentially.
