There  would be  a host  of learning scenarios in  which  several  groups of users could  exchange ideas,  experiences and  perspectives related to both  located  and cloud  learning. For  example, I imagine that  Education students, during  their practicum, might  bring  their  young primary or secondary students to the  space to discuss notions of the  body,  body  image,  collaboration and  cooperation. The public  should have access to the space at times, limited to those periods when the space  is in a set state  (not  under active  construction) to ensure all health, safety and  liability  considerations are  addressed. In this  way  the  constantly changing teaching space can become  a space for public  repose, reflection and  interaction as well as a showcase for innovative approaches to teaching.
