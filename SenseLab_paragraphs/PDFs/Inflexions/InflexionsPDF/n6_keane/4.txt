Since  2008, I have  been  speaking with  people across  the  university sector  to compile information regarding how  a person in my position (a researcher- practitioner within a university setting)  might  build  an  experimental teaching space    informed   by   the   procedural   architecture  of   artist-turned-architects Arakawa and  Gins.  The study presented here,  includes a contextualisation and rationale of building such  an experimental teaching space  in terms  of education, leadership and   the  importance of  embodied  and   integrative  learning. I  will examine  the  link  between  Arakawa  and   Ginsâ€™  practice  and   the  pedagogical concerns of advanced study and  the production of communal space,  suggesting how  these  goals  can be implemented within the institutional planning processes while  adhering to changing federal funding guidelines, new  performance indicators, and public  tender guidelines.
