Bioscleave House in East Hampton, Long Island, NY. I have visited Bioscleave with small groups, organized symposia there (with Lex Baghat and Don Byrd), brought large groups (after the AG3 conference closing event at the Guggenheim in May 2010) and stayed over night on a few occasions.  I have seen the house vigorously activated, youthfully climbed and scrambled over and gingerly navigated. What has stayed with me is the capacity of this building to continue to offer its complexity and reveal in different modes and time frames, its power to prompt and sustain sensory, perceptual and conceptual reconfiguration and attunement.
