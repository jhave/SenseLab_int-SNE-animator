When   I  began   talks   with   Arakawa,  Madeline  Gins   and   staff   at   Facilities Management, Library and  Learning Services  and  Information Systems  at Griffith University in  2008, there  was  no  question in  my  mind that  an  experimental teaching space  would be the  result.  Since then  I have  changed universities and the  feasibility study  that  may  have  resulted in  an  actual   teaching space  has transformed into a case study on the need  and benefits  of such a space. This story therefore, had  to be rewritten to reflect  the changed conditions of the feasibility study to account for the  contingencies encountered along  the  way.  I have  also removed the  names of key  people originally included in  the  study since  they refer to a university at which  I no longer  am employed and  many  no longer  hold those positions.
