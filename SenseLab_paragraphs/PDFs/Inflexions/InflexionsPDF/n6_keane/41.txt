[1] One  of the  new  areas  to  emerge in  tandem with  cognitive science  and  the
‘corporeal turn’ (Sheets-Johnstone 2009) are interdisciplinary investigations concerning the  relationship between the  organism to the  person (consciousness and    ‘prenoetic’   cognition   (Gallagher   2005,   Gallagher   and    Zahavi   2008); philosophy of mind and  cognitive science  (Varela  et al. 2000, Petitot  et al. 1999) and  the relationship of the person to the environment (Noe 2004) and  the field of ecological  psychology. It is important to note  that  these  trends within the fields of study have  been  occurring at  the  same  time  as  a re-evaluation of research methods and design, particularly creative arts research has been conducted.
