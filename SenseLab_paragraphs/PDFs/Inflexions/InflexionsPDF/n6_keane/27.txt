In the  current global  and  regional conditions in which  Higher Education finds itself, the costing  of an experimental teaching space  must  be kept  to a minimum to be feasible.  The initial costs would include the commission of architectural procedures from  Arakawa and  Gins  and  the construction materials. Donated or recycled building materials sourced locally from sponsors, industry partners and from  the University ‘works budget’ for refurbishment would permit easy construction and  dismantling and  reduce costs.  Refurbishment would include rewiring and  outfitting the space  with  structural plywood, for example, to allow manipulation of the space.  The running  costs would include a technician’s salary requiring either  a new position in OTS (Office of Technical  Services) or a sharing of responsibilities between existing  personnel. Equipment such  as  a table  saw and  power tools,  lights  and  storage areas  would be  additional considerations that have an impact on costing.
