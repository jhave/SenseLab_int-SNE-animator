Arakawa  and   Gins  recognize  no  line  between  the  bodily   and   the  “higher” functions such as perceiving, imagining, thinking, and  building. The body  relates directly to the universe: “Surely  there  has never  been a sufficiently diversified approach to the study of the body  in relation to the universe …” (Arakawa and Gins in Govan,1997: 313).
