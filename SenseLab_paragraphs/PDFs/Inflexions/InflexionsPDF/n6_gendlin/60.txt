The implicit  intricacy is never  arbitrary, never  just invented. The implicit  order of any  “this”  is more precise than  an order of already-formed units  can be. You can observe how  precise  it is when you are sitting  with  a felt sense that  you can’t yet express. Sentences come to you, but you reject them:  “No, that’s not exactly what I mean.” You cannot  say what  you  do mean,  but  that  is because it is more precise than  what  these sentences say.
