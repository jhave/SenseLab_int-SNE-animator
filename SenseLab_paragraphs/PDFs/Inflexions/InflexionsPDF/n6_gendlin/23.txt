The inging  is a multiplicity of inter-dependent "units”  that could be separated out but   have   never   been   separate.  A  few   of  these   interdependent  possibilities actually occur  as we go. Most of “them” evolve  in the going  without ever existing separately.
Recognizing  this   order  opens   new   possibilities.  Every   problem  can   seem insoluble, every  situation can seem determined, if we take it to consist  of discrete unitized factors. But no situation is actually made  just of those.
