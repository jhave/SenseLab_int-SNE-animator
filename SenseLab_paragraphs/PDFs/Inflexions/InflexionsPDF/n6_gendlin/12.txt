Of   course    the   stable    (repeatable)  units    and    parts    are   indispensable  for technology. Six billion  people could  not  live on  the  planet without technology. But the units  and  parts  are derivative, made  and  re-made; they are not the given. We must  keep  a set of explicit units  steady (or, more  exactly, change them  slowly over   the   years),    but   we   can   also   recognize   the   ever-fresh   intricacy  of experiencing. We are the inging,  and that is a different kind of order.
