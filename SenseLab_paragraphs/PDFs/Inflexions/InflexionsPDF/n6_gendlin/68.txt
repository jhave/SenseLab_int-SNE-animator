For example, after experiencing TAE in class, a child asks: “But am I my body,  or do I have a body?” We answer, “Oh,  I see, neither ‘am’ nor  ‘have’ fits this.  You and  your  body  are  not  two  things, and  yet not  just the  same  thing  either.  Stick with  how you have  it right there, what  lets you know  that  neither fits. That can let you say something new. It might  sound a little odd.  What would you say?”
