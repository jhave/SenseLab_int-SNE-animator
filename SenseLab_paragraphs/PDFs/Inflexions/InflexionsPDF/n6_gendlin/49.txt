Arakawa and  Gins  can  be misunderstood just  as concretizing contradictions to interrupt our comfortable mental maps.     They speak  of “[…] a path  with built-in contradictions, a path  that  contradicts itself”  (Gins  and  Arakawa 2002: 87). But their art does much  more than  contradict and interrupt.
