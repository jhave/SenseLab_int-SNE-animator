We need  never  remain captured within the existing  concepts, perceptions, interpretations, and  phrases. My philosophy turns to derive new  terms  in which to  think  about  the  nature of bodies,  language, and  situations such  that  this  is possible. Language  is  far  from  being  just  a  system   of  fixed  phrases. From  a specific  intricacy quite  new  phrases can come,  new  metaphorical sentences that surprise us.
