Arakawa and  Gins certainly write  in this way, actually fielding, siting,  adjusting, birthing or holding open.  They write  directly from the intricacy. We may not like or even understand their phrases, but we cannot  take the words in the old way. If we do understand at all, we understand them  in a way  that  instances the inging of which  they speak.
