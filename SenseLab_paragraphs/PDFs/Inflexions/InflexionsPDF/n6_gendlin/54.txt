The access to which  Arakawa and  Gins  point  is through perceiving, imagining, and  building, but they apply their  theories to all human activity.  I provide access through the ongoing process  of speaking, thinking, and acting in situations.
We can easily  discover this access when someone asks us (or we ask ourselves),
”What   were  you  getting at  by  saying   (or  doing)   that,  just  now?  Can you  say more?” These  last  four  words immediately let  us  sense  the  implicit   more.  A whole   chain   comes,   one  thing   after   another.  We  find   the  implicit   sourcing involved in anything we said  or did.  “Can you say more” opens  an access to the specific implicit  intricacy, always many  many  things.
