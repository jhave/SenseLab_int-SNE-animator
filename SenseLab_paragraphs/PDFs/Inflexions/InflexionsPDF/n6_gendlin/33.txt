On  the  basis  of organic symbolizing my  philosophy formulates a derivation of behavior  and   then   of  cognition  as  two   kinds   of  body   process   that   involve “turning”  on  itself,  “having”  itself.     The  plant   does   not   turn   so  as  to  have (perceive) its doing;  it does  not  behave in its perceptions as animals do.    And humans have  a further “turning” and  having, so as to “behave” in cognized “situations.”
