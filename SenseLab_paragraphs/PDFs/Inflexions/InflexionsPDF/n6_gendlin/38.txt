For example, Arakawa and  Gins  are personing in their  use  of “an  organism that persons.” So “persons” can mean  this.    We needn’t first define  it; rather we can define  it  from  here.  Then  we  don’t  reduce the  “inging” to  a mere  concept  of inging.  On  the  contrary, we  can  also  take  the  old  concepts as  referring to  the bodily  implicit  intricacy which  they bring  along.
