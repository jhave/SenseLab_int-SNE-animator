In A Process Model (Gendlin 1997), there  is a conceptual model  that  incorporates the relation between experiencing and  formed forms,  between “ing”  and  “ed.”  In the  new  model  nothing just “is.”    Every  occurring is also an implying  of further occurring. The implying is in the occurring; there  is no separated implying. The implying changes in the environmental occurring so as to imply  a further occurring. Or, we  can  say  that  occurring changes the  implying to imply  a next  occurring. That is what  we call a “process.” This is a new kind  of model, but there  can soon be better  ones of this kind.
