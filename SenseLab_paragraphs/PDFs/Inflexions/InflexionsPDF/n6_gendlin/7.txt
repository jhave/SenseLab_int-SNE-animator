The  “personing” and  the  body  are  not  the  same  thing   but  they  are  also  not different. Arakawa and  Gins do not begin  with  the three  separate things usually meant by “body,” “person,” and  “environment.” Their  “environment” does  not consist  of  unitized entities   filling  an  external space.  Their  “organism- environment” is not  the  body-structure. They  don’t  begin  with  things that  are already observed and  thought about.  The three  were  not first separate and  then
combined. Their hyphenated birthing is first.
