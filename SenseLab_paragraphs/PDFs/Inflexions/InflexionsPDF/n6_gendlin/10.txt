Arakawa and  Ginsâ€™s creations are attempts to provide an access to the inging,  so that we, too, can create in it, and  speak  from it as they do here. In these new uses, the words acquire new meanings. This shows  that the nature of language and  the body  is such  that  we need  never  be captured by the  already-existing meanings, patterns, phrases, and concepts.
