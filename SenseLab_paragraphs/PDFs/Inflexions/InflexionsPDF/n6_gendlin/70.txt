The  implicitly intricate process  is an  implying of next  steps.  It is much  more highly  organized than  any deliberate deciding. Of course  we never  want  to obscure or  preclude it  by  arbitrary inventing. I urge  letting   the  steps  come  from  the bodyâ€™s  implying first,  then  exercising choices  as  needed. And  then  again  see freshly  what  comes in the body.
