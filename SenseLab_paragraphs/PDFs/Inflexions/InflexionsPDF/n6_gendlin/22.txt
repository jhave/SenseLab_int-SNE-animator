Since I am a philosopher, not an artist,  I ask about  this kind of order. I articulate it beyond what  Arakawa and  Gins say but not beyond what  their  sayings imply.  It is not an order of already-determined things and  places.  Neither is it simply indeterminate. We are  not  designing in a void.  The inging  always re-generates, but it is not arbitrary, not just anything at all. We are a very precise kind of ordering which is also an opening for further ordering. The body-environment process  carries itself forward. This is a more  intricate kind  of order than  the kind  that  consists  of already determined units  in categories with  logical  relations, the  kind  of order that is currently still being assumed as the given.
