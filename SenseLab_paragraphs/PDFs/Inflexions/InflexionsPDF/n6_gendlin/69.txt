We are teaching TAE. The children love it because it lets them  discover that  they themselves can think.  Focusing shows  them  where inside  them  new thoughts can come, and  how to let new phrases come. TAE also shows  how to articulate a new pattern from  a new  phrase. For some  adult professionals, later  steps  of TAE go on to lead  to logically  interrelated termsâ€”a formulated theory. It all comes  from the specific intricacy, which  you are-and-have, right there.
