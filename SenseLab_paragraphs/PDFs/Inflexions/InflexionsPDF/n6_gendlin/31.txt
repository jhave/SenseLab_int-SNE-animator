Every    new    behavior   and    cognition   expands   the   whole    bodyâ€™s   implicit functioning, and  then  new  thoughts, new  phrases and  actions  can arise from  the expanded implicit  process  in turn.     This reciprocal development has  happened throughout   human   history,  but   now    we   can   systematically  employ   the reciprocity.   If we  can  access  the  implicit  bodily  functioning, and  if we  move back and  forth  between concepts and  implicit  intricacy, they  expand each  other reciprocally.
