In my use here the word “symbolize” acquires a new  (more  basic) meaning. Our human bodies  also symbolize in this direct  organic-environmental way, more basically  than  with  perceptions or representations, although in humans those  are always implicit  as  well.  Our  “higher” functions are  not  separate; they  always involve  the  organic  symbolizing  process.   That   is  why   our   perceptions and cognitions implicitly involve so much  more  than  if we take them  just as the forms before us.
