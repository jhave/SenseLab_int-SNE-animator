When   some   aspects  of  the   environment  go  missing,  then   the   whole  body- environment process  cannot  happen. If the  organism doesn’t  die,  if some  life process  does  continue, then  the  body-environment process  differentiates itself into  what  continues and  what  does  not.  Later,  when the missing environmental aspects return, the  stopped processes resume, and  the  observer marvels at how the organism “recognizes” its “object.”
