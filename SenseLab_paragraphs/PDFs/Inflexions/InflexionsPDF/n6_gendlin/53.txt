When  I only  imagine this,  what  I perceive remains the  same,  but  it all changes when I get up,  or move  a little.  I can never  walk  into  the  room  that  I see from here.  But  Arakawa and   Gins  build   (for  example)  a  three-dimensional  room structured in accord  with  two views,  both from one spot and from the ceiling.    In their   creations  there   are  several   paths  to  go  from   any   spot.   Each  requires ducking, twisting, and  feeling  our  way  around the other  pathways. As we move and  enact  some  series  of actually occurring body-environment events  (“landing sites”), we grasp that  we are the process  of eventing the environment. We are not caught in one mere “is.” We are the inging process.
