This   is   one  way  of   understanding   “microperception,”   a  concept of   great importance to Deleuze and Guattari. Microperception is not smaller perception; it’s a perception of a qualitatively different kind. It’s something that is felt without registering  consciously. It registers  only  in  its  effects.  According  to this  notion  of shock, there is always a commotion under way, a “something  doing” as James would say. There  is  always  a something-doing  cutting  in,  interrupting  whatever continuities are in progress. For things to continue, they have to re-continue. They have to re-jig  around  the interruption.  At  the instant  of  re-jigging,  the body braces for what will come. It in-braces, in the sense that it returns to its potential for more of life to come, and that potential is immanent to its own arising.
