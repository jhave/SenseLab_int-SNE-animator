environment of potential. If you  manage to, you  will avoid the paralysis of hopelessness.  Neither  hope nor  hopelessness—a  pragmatics  of  potential.  You have to live it at every level. In the way you relate to your partner, and even your cat.  The  way  you teach a class  if you’re  a professor.  The  way  you create and present your art if you’re an artist. If you participate in more punctual events like the ones  I  was  describing,  this  will  provide  a continuous  background  for what comes of those events to disseminate into and diffuse through. A symbiosis of the special event and the day-to-day, in creative connivance.
