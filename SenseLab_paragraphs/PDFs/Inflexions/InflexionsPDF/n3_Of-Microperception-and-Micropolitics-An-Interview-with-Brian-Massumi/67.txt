The  group  furring  and performed  transition  mechanisms  are  little  examples  of what we call “techniques of relation.” The challenge for each event is to find the enabling  constraints  and techniques  of  relation that tailor  the event to what’s singular  about that particular  coming together.  To  do that you  need to know something about what moves the people who will come. So there are pre-event techniques for relation that have to be in place to prepare the ground. And the post-event  collaborative  developments are crucial  to network,  because  that is where what happened in the event really eventuates.
