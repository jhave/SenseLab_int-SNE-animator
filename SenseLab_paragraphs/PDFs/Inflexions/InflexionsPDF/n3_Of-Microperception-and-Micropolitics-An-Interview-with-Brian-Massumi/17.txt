BM: Shock.   That’s   what  Peirce   says.   Affect   for  me is   inseparable   from   the concept of shock. It doesn’t have to be a drama. It’s really  more about micro- shocks, the kind that populate every moment of our lives. For example a change in  focus,  or  a rustle  at the periphery  of  vision  that draws  the gaze  toward  it.  In every shift of attention, there is an interruption, a momentary cut in the mode of onward  deployment  of  life.  The  cut can pass  unnoticed,  striking  imperceptibly, with only its effects entering conscious awareness as they unroll. This is the onset of the activation I was referring to earlier. I’d go so far  as to say that this onset of experience is by nature imperceptible.
