BM: The  notion  of  affect  does  take  many forms,  and you’re  right  to begin  by emphasizing  that. To  get anywhere  with  the concept, you   have to retain the manyness  of  its  forms.  It’s not something  that can be reduced  to one thing. Mainly  because  it’s  not a thing.  It’s an event, or  a dimension  of  every event. What interests me in the concept is that if you  approach it respecting its variety, you are  presented  with  a field  of  questioning,  a problematic  field,  where the
customary  divisions  that questions  about subjectivity,  becoming, or  the  political are usually   couched in   do  not  apply. My  starting  point  is  the  basic   Spinozan definition  of  affect,  which is an “ability to affect  or  be affected.”  Right  off the
bat,  this   cuts  transversally   across   a persistent   division,    probably  the  most
persistent division. Because the ability  to affect and the ability  to be affected are two facets of  the same  event. One face is turned towards  what you  might be tempted to isolate as an object, the other towards what you  might isolate as a subject. Here, they are two sides of the same coin. There is an affectation, and it is happening in-between. You start with  the in-betweenness. No need  to detour through well-rehearsed questions of philosophical foundations in order to cobble together a unity.  You  start  in  the middle,  as  Deleuze  always  taught, with  the dynamic unity of an event.
