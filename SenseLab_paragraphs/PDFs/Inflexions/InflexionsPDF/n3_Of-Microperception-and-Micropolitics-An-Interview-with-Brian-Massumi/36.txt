So  there are  at least  those  three kinds  of  memory:  a memory  of  the present, which is the past actively  contracted  into  the cut of  the present  instant  (what I call the “here-and-now” to differentiate it from the specious present); a memory of   the  past,  which   is   a rearview   of   the  past  from   the  perspective   of   the consciously  experienced  specious  present  of  lived  duration;  and a memory  of the future,  which is  the quasicausal  force  of  tendency, as governed  recursively by the futurity  of the terminus toward which it tends.
