feeling of the frightfulness of the situation. It only dawns on you in the next instant that youâ€™d better  figure out what might have done the catapulting,  and what you should  do about. It is only  then that you own the feeling as your own, and recognize it  as a content of  your life,  an episode in your personal  history.  But in the instant of the affective hit, there is no content yet. All there is is the affective quality,  coinciding  with  the feeling  of   the interruption,  with  the kind  of  felt transition I talked about before. That affective quality is all there is to the world in that instant. It takes over life, fills the world, for an immeasurable instant of shock. Microperception is this purely affective rebeginning of the world.
