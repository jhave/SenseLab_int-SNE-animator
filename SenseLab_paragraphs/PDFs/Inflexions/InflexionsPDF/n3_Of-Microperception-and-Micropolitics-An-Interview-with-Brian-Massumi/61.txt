Our  point  of  departure is what we call  “enabling  constraints”—sets of  designed constraints that are meant to create specific conditions for creative interaction where  something is  set   to happen,  but there is  no preconceived  notion  of exactly what the outcome will be or  should be. No  deliverable. All process. We started  practicing  what we thought of  as event design,  design  for  alternative format  art-academic  events. The  stakes  aren’t defined  so much  by  issues  or content or  definable  outcome. The  stakes  are  the event happening or  not, seeing what can be done to open up new ground for exploration and invention that reenergizes  people  and makes  their  lives  in  and around  the institutions  in which they function at the same time more livable and more intense.
