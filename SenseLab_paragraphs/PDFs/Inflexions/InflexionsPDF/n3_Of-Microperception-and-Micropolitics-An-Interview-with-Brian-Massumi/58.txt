Micropolitically, critique has to come from  within, in the thick  of things, and that means getting your hands dirty.  There is no situation of being outside a situation. And no situation is subject to mastery. It is only by  recognizing the bonds of complicity and the limitations that come with the situation that you  can succeed in  modulating  those  constraints  at the constitutive  level,  where they reemerge and seriate. This is immanent “critique.” It is active, participatory critique. For me, micropolitical action  involves  this  kind of  immanent critique that actively  alters conditions of emergence. It engages becoming, rather than judging what is.
