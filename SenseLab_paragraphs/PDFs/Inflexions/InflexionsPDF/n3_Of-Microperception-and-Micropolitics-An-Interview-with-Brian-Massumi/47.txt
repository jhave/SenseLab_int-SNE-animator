BM: I  agree  that the potential  is  there, but I  don’t agree  that it’s  inherent  to affective  politics.  The  mistrust  of  affect  seems  to come from  seeing affect  as  a primitive stimulus-response system. I connect it instead to priming, which does not have the linear cause-effect structure of stimulus-response, but has to do instead with  modulation,  which  has  to do with  interference  and resonance,  which  are nonlinear.  Stimulus-response  is a limit  case.  It’s that case  of  a habit that has become a reflex,   lost  its adaptive power,  its powers  of  variation,  its force  of futurity,  that has  ceased to be the slightest  surprised  by  the world. It’s  a tired habit  that has   come as   close to  being   an efficient   cause as  a power  of repetition can get. It has let go of the “quasi” in its causality. There is also a sense in the critiques of affective politics as fascist that nonconscious process is an absence of  thought. I  follow  Deleuze  and Guattari in saying  that nonconscious process is the birth  of thought. It is germinal thought, moved by  the force of time to express powers of existence in coming action.
