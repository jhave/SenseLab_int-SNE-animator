All that happens in the cut, in the instant of  commotion,  microshock, or  welling event-suspense.  It occurs  on the microperceptual  level,  in  an interval  smaller than the smallest perceivable, to paraphrase Deleuze. It cannot be consciously perceived. What we perceive is what unfolds from that interpenetration of moments, as the coming event plays itself out. We perceive the trailing into the situation  of  the past already tending  out of  that situation  toward the future  of event’s  having  happened. What  we experience  is  like  a doppler  effect  of  the force  of  time.  It is  due to this  doppler  effect  that we experience  the moment, that is, that we experience a duration, that we feel time to have extension. That duration is our  experience straddling  those  dimensions of  time, as much like  a thought as in  unfolding  action. The  duration  registers  with  an affective tonality. We  have a primarily  qualitative experience of  time extension. This  qualitatively lived  time is what William  James  called  the specious  present.  It’s  “specious” because  it’s  all  coming out of  a fissure  in  time, a cut in  time,  a shock  and suspense. The microshocks don’t stop. They come in droves, all in intervals smaller than the smallest  perceivable.  All  cut, all  the time,  in  infinite  division.  It is  only because an affective tonality envelops groupings of them, continues through or around them, that we feel the moment as having extension, rather than feeling it
