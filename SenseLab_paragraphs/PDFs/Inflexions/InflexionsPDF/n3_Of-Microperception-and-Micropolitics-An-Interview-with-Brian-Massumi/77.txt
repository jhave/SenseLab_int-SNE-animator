macro- and micropolitical. The prevailing operating conditions of macro/micropo- litical  reciprocity should not be taken to imply  that the symmetry is never broken, that a bifurcation can never occur. The complementarity can be broken in both directions. When macrostructures  miniaturize themselves and  work  to usurp the ground of the micropolitical with  scaled-down versions of the dominant generali- ties, that is fascism. When micropolitical flourishings proliferate to produce a singu- larity,  in the sense of  a systemic tipping point, that’s revolution. The  ultimate vo- cation of micropolitics is this: enacting the unimaginable. The symmetry-breaking point, the point at which the unimaginable eventuates, is but a cut, “smaller” than the  smallest historically perceivable interval. That  is to say, qualitatively different. A moment of a different color, one you  never see coming, that comes when it’s least expected. Inevitably, a next micro/macro complementarity will quickly settle in. But it will take a form  that could not have been predicted, but is now suddenly doable and thinkable. Micropolitics is what makes the unimaginable practicable. It’s the potential that makes possible.
