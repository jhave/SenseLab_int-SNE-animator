It  was   Erin  who  initially   started   the  Sense   Lab,   which  I    then  joined  as   a collaborator. Looking at  the  milieus  we were in,  and  between the art   and academic institutions, we thought that there are things each side could offer the otherâ€”seeds of symbiosis. From the academic side, what could be brought into the art  world is a tendency or  propensity  toward  rigorous verbal  expression.  On the art  side  is a complementary propensity  to invest  in an object or  system  or interaction an intensity that rigorously exceeds language, at least standard denotative or  referential  uses of  language. We  wanted to bring together  those two tendencies: bringing concepts to rigorous verbal expression, and intensifying perception and experience.
