BM: Although the  “micro” of  micropolitical  is not  synonymous with  small,   and although the modulations  that might be effected at that level  can be widely distributed, there is no better place to start than the local  context  in which you live  and work every  day. Macropolitical  positioning operates  under  the illusion that there is a neutral,  higher-level vantage point allowing you to stand outside and judge, while  standing pure, correct, and unsullied. Critique, practiced in this way,  does  double  duty. It opposes  too simplistically,  I  would argue. But  it also shields. To judge from outside is to ensconce yourself in an unassailable position.
