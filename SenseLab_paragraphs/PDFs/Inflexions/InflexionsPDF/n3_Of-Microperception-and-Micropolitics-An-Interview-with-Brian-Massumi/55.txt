The  world  is  too complex  to hold  to that as  a model. The  fragmentation  of nations  into  sub-communities,  the accompanying  increase  in  the number of nation-states formed from these communities, the destructuring effects of movements of capital, the way these unchained capital flows enable or force a constant movement of  people,  goods,  ideas,  and information across borders— all of this has created a hyper-complex situation of flow and variation over which there’s  no effective  oversight.  There’s no  vantage  point  from  which  you could encompass  it  all;  there’s  no shared  perspective  from  which  to find  a common language or build a consensus or share a rationality. The situation is constitutively dissensual.  Rather than going  back to the failed  project  of  finding  a common language, purpose, or rationality, it would seem that the complexity of that dissensus should  be the starting  point  for politics.  Why  accept as  the starting point a reduction of difference, a channeling into tired habit? That’s to start with defeat.   Taking   complexity   for  a starting   point,   broadly   speaking,   is   what “ecological”  means.  I  see  affective  intensity  and an aesthetics  of  varying  life potential as the elements of an ecology of practices of the symbiotic kind called for by  Stengers, and before her by  Guattari. From  this symbiotic perspective, an anti-capitalist politics begins by  affirming the variability and potential for forms of life  unleashed  by  capitalism  itself.  It continues  the differentiation  of  forms of  life already  under way,  but by other means,  governed  by other constellations  of termini and embodying other values.
