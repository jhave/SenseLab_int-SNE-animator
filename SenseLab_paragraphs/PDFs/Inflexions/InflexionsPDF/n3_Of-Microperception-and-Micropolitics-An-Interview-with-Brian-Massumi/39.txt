carries   with   it  a  memory. A  memory that  also  then  becomes   potentially reactivated  or  could  change the experience  of  the body in  another situation. You  mentioned  that these shocks occur  at a microperceptual  level  and that thereâ€™s  an after-the-fact  conscious  duration  that we experience  and we hold with  us  that is actually  quite different  than the original microperceptual  shock experience. Could the memory that this affective qualitative change carries with it be described  as a becoming sensitive  to those  microperceptual  shocks?  So can  we begin  to become  more  aware  of  these affective  shocks  that are obviously  influencing  us or  having  an impact  on us continuously?  Is that part  of the potential process?
