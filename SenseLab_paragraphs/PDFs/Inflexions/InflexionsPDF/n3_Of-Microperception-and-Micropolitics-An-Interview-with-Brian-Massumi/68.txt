For us  it’s very  important that  what transpires be  gathered  in language. We’re both writers.  We  both think  of  what we do as  philosophy.  So  we always  try  to create a real,  effective  presence  of  philosophy.  But not as  a master  discipline that judges other kinds of practice. We see it as a symbiosis, where practices that are not primarily  linguistic are seen to bear active conceptual force that can be brought to explicit  verbal expression,  and by  being  brought into  language can cycle   back   into   the  practice   from   which they  develop  to  spur   it  further. Conversely,  we approach philosophy as Deleuze  and Guattari define  it, as the creation  of  concepts.  So  philosophy  is  seen  as  a creative  practice  in  its  own right, with its own material and medium, which is language. Another challenge: other  techniques  of   relation   have to be  invented   to  foster   this   reciprocity between modes of creative activity favoring different media. A great deal of our thinking  about and experimenting  with event design is concerned with this,  not only in our special events but in the regular day-to-day functioning of the Sense Lab  group, locally as well as remote, through an itnernet grouphub.
