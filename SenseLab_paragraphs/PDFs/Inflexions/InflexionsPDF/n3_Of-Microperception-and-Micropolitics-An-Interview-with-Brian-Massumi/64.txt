about  what  kinds   of   spatial   setup  would   work    best,   how  to  modulate expectations as people entered the space, and how to break expectations but in  a gentle and inviting  way.  We  started  thinking in  terms of  hospitality. That became our model. How  do we create enabling constraints so that the situation is  one of  hospitality,  not a test and not a show-and-tell.  We  tried  to find  very small,   concrete ways  of  doing  that,  trying to  anticipate  the roadblocks  that traditional events throw up. The moment of entry is crucial. How people enter an event implants all kinds of dynamics. Once they’re in, group dynamics becomes
the next challenge. Take  for example  the plenary.  You  want some whole-group interaction, otherwise the event feels dispersed and no one leaves with a sense that anything  happened. But  plenaries  are  deadly.  People  zone  out. A  few people  dominate.  Others  don’t feel  empowered  to speak.  Discussions  get too general,  with  the same words  being  used with  different  connotations,  and no one really  connecting  with  what anyone  else  is  saying.  It’s deadly.  But  if  you have small  groups,  how do you form  them, and what do they do so  that they are  not just  plenaries  in  miniature?  And if  something  really  happens  in  a small group, which is where things are most likely to happen, how do you convey that
to the other groups, or the group as a whole? These were the kinds of questions
we asked.
