We set  it  up at a community-based  electronic art  institution,  the Society  for Art and Technology,  that is located  between  the Montreal universities  in an urban space  where Montreal’s  different  language  communities  intermix,  and where academics,  university-based  artists,  and community-based  independent  artists can come together. We  tried to think of how to create events that would bring people together, not on a blank slate, not even on even ground, but rather from a creative  bias,  from  the angle of  what  most moved  them, what moved  their work,   what made  it  work.   The  first thing  we did  was  to forbid  anyone from bringing  completed  work.  We  wanted them to bring  not the work,  but what made the work – the tendencies,  skills,  obsessions,  attractions,  inclinations  that drove it from  within. We set up a situation that for some would be interpreted as an artistic exhibition, for others as a conference. But it was neither. No one was going  to show anything  or  deliver  anything.  The  situation  wasn’t  recognizable, which  we knew could  be disturbing  and might  intimidate.  We  had to have a certain   estrangement,   but  that  wasn’t   the  point.   It  was   just   one  of   the enablements. We  wanted to bring people together  at their  work’s constitutive level, whereas they are used to being asked to come with it already constituted, so   to  enable   the  event  we had  to  disable   certain   kinds   of   expectations. Suspend.  Like  a shock, but not in  the macro sense, just  enough to give  pause and toggle  out of  default  settings.  We  thought hard—by  we I   mean a very dedicated  collective  involving students  and others  committed to the project—
