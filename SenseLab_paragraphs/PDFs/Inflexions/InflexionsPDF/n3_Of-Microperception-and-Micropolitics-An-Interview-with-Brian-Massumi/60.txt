A lot of the impetus for what we’re doing came from  some very intense conversations we had with Isabelle Stengers, who explained that her criteria for a successful  intellectual  event was  precisely  that –  that it  be an event. For something to happen that wouldn’t have happened otherwise. If heaven, according  to an old  Talking  Heads  song, is  where nothing  ever happens,  then the conference is surely  academic heaven. When was the last  time you had a truly  new thought at a conference?  When was  the last  time  that you saw an opinion changed by  an academic discussion  or  debate? On  the art  side,  the equivalent  heavens  are  the artists  talk   and  the standard  gallery   exhibition. Isabelle  also  emphasized  that it  is  not a question  of  “freedom,”  in the sense of simply  lifting  constraints.  Nothing  happens  most where there are  no constraints, because  anything  goes, and anything  going  is  just  nothing  carried  to a higher power, heaven to the nth  degree. You might avoid the conference, but where does that get you if  you end up with  the kind  of  free-floating,  free-associating discussion you  might enjoy late at night in a dormitory room? Without constraints there are no stakes.
