effectiveness  of  the action  it  passes  into.  Whitehead  defines  the aesthetic  in terms of this intensity of contrasts. An aesthetic act brings this contrastive intensity out from  under the shadow of action’s instrumentality or functional aim. It brings the contrastive intensity of active potential into the specious present as such, to stand  alone, with  no other  value than  itself.  The  aesthetic  act extends  the creative tension of contrast that characterizes the emergence of every action. It prolongs   the  suspension   of   the  cut,  the  commotion   of   interference   and resonance, gives it duration, so that it passes the threshold of perceptibility and is consciously  felt  as potential. This prevents  terminus from   being  an automatic feed  forward  to the end,  like  a reflex   response  to a stimulus.  Resolution  is suspended.  The  termini  in play remain virtual  ends. Their  mutual exclusivity  is still informing the situation, contributing to what it might be, but the tension doesn’t have to resolve  itself  to be consciously  felt  and thought. Aesthetic  politics  is irresolute. It’s the thinking-feeling of the virtual incompletion of definitive action.
