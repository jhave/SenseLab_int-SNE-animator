BM: Yes,  that’s  definitely  part of  the potential process.  It’s a way  of  acquiring new propensities,  which  if  they become embedded  in  our  everyday life,  are habits. As they repeat themselves, we become aware that they function, even if we are  not aware  of  them as  they function.  That  secondary  awareness  easily wears out. Habits are ways  of  not attending-to,  while  still  acting according-to. Their  nonconsciousness  functioning  is  self-repeating,  an iterative  process  that can end up becoming  a caricature  of  itself.  A habit can habituate to itself.  By that I meant that it can end up not attending to the newness or difference in the situations triggering it. When this happens, it has a tendency to make the coming event conform  to past events. It loses  its  powers  of  adaptation,  its  power  to renew itself, becoming a mere reflex.
