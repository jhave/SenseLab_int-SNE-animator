The  opposite  can also  happen. Habit  can rebecome  a creative  force  for the acquisition   of   new  propensities,   because it   makes   capacities   available   for enaction,  and something  can vary  in the course of  that making-available,  and then be added to a body’s repertory. To mobilize habit in this rebecoming way, the body, as  you say, has  to become sensitive  to what’s  coming.  It has  to feel the priming, as a formative force, before it bears fruit. Perversely, this is a kind of preemptive power. It is a preemptive power that is creative of a moreness to life, what I call an ontopower. I say it’s perverse because I am convinced that it is the same  power  mobilized by  the contemporary military  machine.  In some  of  the most affect-  and perception-savvy  recent  texts in military  theory, they call  this rebecoming-creative  of  habit  “non-recognition-based  priming”  and “sampling the future.” It’s part of a colonization of the micoperceptual by the war machine that deserves serious study.
