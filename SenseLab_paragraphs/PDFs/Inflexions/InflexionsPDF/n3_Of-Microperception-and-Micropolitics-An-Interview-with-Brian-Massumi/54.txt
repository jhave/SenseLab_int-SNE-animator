power-over, very different from empowerment, the power-to of ontopower. I wouldn’t want it because in my  way of thinking it would be inaesthetic. It would be de-intensifying. It would flatten affect by  standardizing response. It would put politics back on the uncreative road  to reflex.  Consensus is always the product of  a power-over.  It is  a habituation  to it,  even if  it’s  a soft  form   of  it.  I  can’t imagine  a  “common  language”   that  is  not  consensus   building  in   a de- intensifying way.
