BM: There are different kinds of memory. There’s a kind of memory that’s directly implicated in  any perception, couched  in acquired or  inbred  inclinations  and propensities that a body carries forward. This is a past that is not in any subjective representation,  it’s  a past that is only in  its  activation.  It’s  an enacted past, actively present. It’s not in the head, but in the middle, in rearising relationship, in situation. It’s as much like a thought as an action.
