their    trees,   not   even   in   their    national  parks.    They   have    demolished everything. They  skimmed the  fat  off  the  forests  (as  they  say  in  technical terms)  and  after that  they created the national parks;  they skimmed the cream off of indigenous peoples, and  after that, they recognized them  as peoples. It’s not  like  that  here.  In  Peru,  as  well  as  in  the  Andes – which  constitutes a natural  barrier  between  the   coast   and   the   jungle   –  appalling  terrorism contributed to keeping the exploitation of the Amazon at bay. Terrorism has set Peru  30 or 40 years  behind in terms  of its exploitation of natural resources. This lag has allowed Peru  to retain  a certain  quality of rivers  and  tributaries, which  should be appraised and  managed differently. There  should be a reassessment of water, in the current context  of the survival of the planet, that is, relying  on river  sources as the  source  of water and  life, and  not  only  as a source   of  hydroelectric energy. And  we  must   recognize that  these  topics, which  today are  considered “externalities” of  the  capitalist socio-economic system,  in a few years will no longer  be “externalities” when the planet can no longer  take the heat.
