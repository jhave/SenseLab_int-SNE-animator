AFG:  Since  that  time,  when you  carried out  your  work  on  Alrededor del dosel,  until  today, there  is at least  4 times  more  population in the  Madre de Dios area.  We are talking about  100,000 new  people whose  only  relationship to the jungle  is commercial, or some kind  of provision of services.  This means that,  in  less  than  a generation, four  times  the  amount of pressure is being placed on the  forest’s capacity for resource extraction. At the  same  time,  we have  only  a  quarter of  the  knowledge that  existed   back  then  as  to  what constitutes the jungle  in its entirety. This is mainly due  to the construction of the  Interoceanic Highway, which  extends from  Brazil  to  the  Pacific  Ocean. And  this is only the beginning. All of the jungle  has been  sold.  This brings  in more  development megaprojects  focused on  high  productivity at a low  cost (biodiesel, hydrocarbons,  hard  wood  “Huairo  potato”  prices).   The government  has   made    the   rules    of   the   game    through  the   mask    of sustainability. But these  rules  are only aimed at the aggressive exploitation of natural resources, and  not the assessment of their  actual  value  with  a view  to their long-term survival.
