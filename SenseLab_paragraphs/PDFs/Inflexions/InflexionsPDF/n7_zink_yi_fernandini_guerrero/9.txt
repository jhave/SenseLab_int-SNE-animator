When  I arrived here, people from  the Andes came to practice agriculture and were,  believe  it or not, tied  to nature’s cycles and  its elements. Today,  people come to extract  gold, transnationals to extract  oil, and  others  to commercialize wood without any  notion of what  a living  tree looks  like. They  have  no idea what  animals or species  depend on this  tree.  Nor  do  they  know  how  long  it takes  for the  tree  to grow  to such  dimensions. Therefore, today the  urgency has  changed, the  urgency is  not  only  to  study and  protect some  areas,  or species.  Rather,  it is urgent to raise  awareness in the  Amazon’s new  market populations, to  assess  the  environmental cost  as  fundamental to  its productivity. And  I’m not necessarily talking about  the area’s immigrant population. Amazon settlers won’t  save  the  jungle,  neither will  our government. The world population must  be involved.
