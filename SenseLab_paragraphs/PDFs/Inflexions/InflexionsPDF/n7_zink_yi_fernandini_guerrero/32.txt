In   environmental  matters,  we   need   the   world  to   understand  that   the Shihuahuaco has  another price  for the Amazon rainforest, and  that  it should have  another price  for the  world that  consumes it. We also need  institutions that  sell  the  idea  of protecting the  Amazon to  include in  their  certification criteria   the  relationship that  the  trees  have  with   an  eagle’s  nest.  In  other words, for example, one  would not  be able certify  a tree  that  has  housed an eagle’s nest. They must  include programs for the conservation of endangered fauna  in their certification requirements.
