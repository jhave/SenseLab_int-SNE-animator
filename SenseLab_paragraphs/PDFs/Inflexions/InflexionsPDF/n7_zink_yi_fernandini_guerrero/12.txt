powerfully, and   even  dictatorially, decided.  This  was  clearly  reflected by Peru’s  former president, Alan  García,  when he  said,  while  referring to  the conflict  occurring in Bagua,  that  400,000 primitive Indians were  not  going  to put  the  brakes  on  the  country’s  progress. According to him,  these  were  not first-class  citizens  and  the  progress of a  developing country would not  be stopped because of them.  Today,  in  Brazil,  to  give  another example, in  the name   of  “national interests,” hundreds  of  Kayapó   communities are  being flooded to build  the Belo Monte  dam.  And here in the Peruvian Amazon there are plans  to dam  the River Marañón twenty times,  as well as to dam  another eight  primary rivers   to  generate hydroelectricity, whose   major  volume of energy production will go to Brazil. The same  is being  planned for Inambari and  Madre de  Dios.  Peru  will  be left with  environmental  liabilities that  are greater than  those  that  could  be covered by remedial actions  or the mitigation of  environmental  impacts. That  is,  the  environmental costs  and  the  future conflicts  over  water that  will be left to Peru  (or better  said,  to this area),  after its  resources  are  used   up,  will  never   be  covered. It’s  also  shocking  that, nowadays, carbon  cowboys come  into  native   communities to  seduce them and  buy  them  carbon  bonds at risible  prices,  in order to speculate with  these certificates on the stock market.
