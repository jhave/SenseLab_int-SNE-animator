Since the goal is to base everything on the democratic system  and  on statutes created by  laws  and  lawyers, we  should change everything at  its  root.  The Amazon communities need  to create  their  own  constitution. This  document should recognize their  territory;  it should include their  world-view, that  is, what   their  territory means   to  them,  what   their  traditional values   mean  to them,   and   what   their   relationship  to  the  water,  mountains,  land,   plans, animals, etc.  means   to  them.   This  constitution is  necessary so  that  a  new leader, an indigenous leader, who might  otherwise be vulnerable to the temptations  created  by   those   who   come   to   divide  them,   who   has   no experience in this ancestral knowledge, might  have  a foundation on which  to govern and  a mandate that  the people respect, since nowadays, it is precisely the democratic system  that makes  this head  of a community a non-expert, and therefore not  a  leader recognized by  consensus, to  carry  out  the  people’s mandate. Nowadays, with  only  51% of the  vote,  you  can  be the  leader of a community. And  this 51%, in some  cases, costs you  four  cows, or a thousand soles,  which  an  oil, mining, or  forestry company – that  wants your  trees  – paid  you  and  which  allowed you  to win  the  elections,  so that  you,  in turn, grant them  concessions for all the  trees  in your  region,  or allow  them  entry into your  community so that they can kick-off their plans  for extraction. A grandfather  that   sees  this   in  these   communities,  and   who,   with   all  his knowledge and  roots  in  his  traditions, sees  in  the  new  generations people who are capable  of selling their own territories. Committed to his own people, he  sees  this  as  a  hecatomb:  as  total  destruction. All  this  produces a  lot  of insecurity in these people.
