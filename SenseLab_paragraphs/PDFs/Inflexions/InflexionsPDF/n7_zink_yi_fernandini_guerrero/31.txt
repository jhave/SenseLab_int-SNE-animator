AFG…. Of course  it’s absurd, but  it’s that  the western world is not  aware of how  the  Amazon environment works.  The criteria  of certification, which  are aimed at transforming the  exploitation of forest  resources into  a sustainable practice in the  eyes  of consumer society,  do  not  take  into  consideration the strength the natural world needs  to regenerate hardwood species  with marketable diameters. They  impose measures required for softwood lumber, such  as  the  conifers  of the  northern hemisphere, where there  is a basis  for these  certifications. That  is, they  are  trying to apply the  needs  of European forests  onto  Amazon forests,  whose  ecology  is diametrically opposed to that of coniferous forests.  And  it’s  that,  in a society  whose  vision  is restricted to consumption, having an  FSC certification works.   In  other  words, it  makes them  feel like  they  are  doing  something for the  Amazon rainforest. As you say: there  are no certifications for the Sequoias of California, so why  do they exist  for  the  Shihuahuacos,  which   are  trees   that   house   the  nests   of  the Amazon’s endangered eagles?  Western markets buy  a Shihuahuaco with  this “green  star”   without  knowing that   it  had   an  eagle’s  nest  at  its  top.  It’s illogical, that  approach and  pretense of wanting to convert a completely destructive activity  into sustainable practice.
