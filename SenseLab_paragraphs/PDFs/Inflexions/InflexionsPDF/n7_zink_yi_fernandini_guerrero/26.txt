AFG: As I was  saying  to you,  nowadays different forms  of speculation have been created through carbon  bonds. However, water is still not considered an environmental   service    for    humanity.   To   understand   this,    one    must understand that  having water in Belem  (in the  Amazon River  delta)  and  is very  different from  having water at  the  source  of that  same  river.  They’re totally  different situations: at one extreme is where the water is received and, at  the  other,  is the  water’s  origin  or  source.  The  sources of diversity of the Amazon rainforest are in the misty  forests,  in the eastern parts  of the Amazon rivers.  And  where are  those  rivers?  They  are  not  in Brazil,  but  in Peru.  One must  resuscitate and  rethink the concept  of the Amazon. When  one speaks of the  Amazon, on a global  level,  one  thinks of Brazil, and  not  of Peru.  Peru  is associated  with   the   Andes,  Cuzco,   Machu   Picchu.   Some  of  the  primary sources of the great  Amazon river,  such  as the Marañón and  the Ucayali,  are in Peru.  And  the Madre de Dios river,  one of its primary southern tributaries, is also  in Peru.   Now  they  are  thinking of damming all of these  tributaries. And  for whom? For a country that  has already drained its own  Amazon. The Brazilian  Amazon is dry,  dead, transgenic, and  focused on the production of “consumer goods.” The only Amazon rainforest left to Brazil is in its national parks,  only there.  Not even  its indigenous populations have  rainforest. If you see a photo of indigenous peoples in Brazil,  for us  that  is called  Purma, the secondary forests,  where there  had  previously been  a chacra,  a forgotten plot of land.  There  are no longer  any giant  Shihuahuacos, and  if there  are some  to be  found, they  measure maybe  30cm  in  diameter. There  are  no  more  hard wood trees, they have  no more  Cahobas left, there  is no more  living history in
