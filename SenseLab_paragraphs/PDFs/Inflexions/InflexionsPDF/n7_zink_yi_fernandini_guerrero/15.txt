communities,   what    legal    material   protects   indigenous   peoples?   The constitution of Peru  does  not recognize their  existence  at a fundamental level, as this Peruvian constitution separates its territories into land,  subsoil,  air, and water.   In   contrast,   an   indigenous   community,   after    much    surviving, evolution, and  cultural learning, understands its environment as a whole territory, a territory on which  it is impossible to attempt to subsist separately, which   is  what   is  understood  and   carried  out   by   the   exploitation and devastation of its resources. The Peruvian constitution separates its territories into  layers  and  says:  you  are  the  owner of the  first  half  meter,  and  another will  be the  owner of your  subsoil,  and  another person of your  forests,  and others   of  your   waterways,  etc.  This,  in  addition to  creating  innumerable conflicts  with  hundreds of petitions over  “foreign invaders,” creates  endless bureaucratic problems over concessions in their territories with  terms  that are, needless say, disadvantageous. It is like a cancer that has been introduced into the communities.
