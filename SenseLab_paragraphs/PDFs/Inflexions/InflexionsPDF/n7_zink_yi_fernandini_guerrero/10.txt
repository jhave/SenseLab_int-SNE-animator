DZY: The Peruvian government sells concessions in this  region,  where there are supposed to be intangible areas,  or areas  reserved for the  protection and preservation of nature. This is a contradiction. Furthermore, it seems  its role and   responsibilities toward  the  communities  living  in  this  area  end  once concessions are ceded.  The communities must  deal  directly with  mining, oil, and  forestry companies. However, one also supposes that  the  government is obliged,  by  so-called   prior   consultation  with   indigenous  peoples, to  seek dialogue with the communities before doing  this. Is this not so?
