This kind  of constitution, I’ve seen it applied by First Nations in Canada, with whom I’m working as a bridge between Canadian and Peruvian communities, and  whose  proposal has  been  accepted by some  indigenous communities in the  Amazon. The  idea  is to understand and  adapt their  methods regarding governability  and   the   creation  of  our   own   constitution.  It  is  not   about separatist aspirations. Rather  it is about  a self-recognition out  of which  we might  teach  the  world about  an  ancient way  of viewing development and which   is  an  integral  part   of  the  Amazon.  I  am  trying  to  strengthen the foundations for this  idea  and  help  to create  the first Indigenous Constitution of the Amazon. If the former is achieved, let’s hope  that  latter  will follow suit, and that the communities begin to protect and articulate themselves in this manner.
