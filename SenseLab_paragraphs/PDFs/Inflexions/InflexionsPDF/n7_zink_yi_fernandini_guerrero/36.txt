DZY: Juan Javier Salazar,  a Peruvian artist,  always reminds me that  we come from  a country where gold  is usually extracted, painstakingly worked, and ultimately placed back  into  the  earth.  I think  this  apparent contradiction or different valuing of things reflects  the  dilemma that  we are  talking about.  If indigenous societies  in the Amazon have  to learn  to work  with  a written constitution, what  thought would you  have  for the  people living  in western societies?
