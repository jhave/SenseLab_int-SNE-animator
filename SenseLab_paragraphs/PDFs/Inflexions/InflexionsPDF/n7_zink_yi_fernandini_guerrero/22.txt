DZY:  Itâ€™s   interesting  that   peoples  or   societies   that   continue  to  practice indigenous  traditions  have   to  resort   to  a  written  constitution in  order to subsist in the face of this threat. But beyond that,  do you really  think  that  this constitution will  be  tolerated and  recognized by  the  national constitution? Where  could  dialogue as equals  occur?
