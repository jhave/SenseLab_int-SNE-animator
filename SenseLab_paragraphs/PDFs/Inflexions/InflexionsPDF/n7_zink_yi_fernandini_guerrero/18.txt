peoples themselves don’t have documents with  which  to show  the world why they  are fighting in this way  and  why  they  are defending their  interests, they will   continue  to   be   seen   as   insurgents, revolutionaries, terrorists, and primitives, as  Alan  García  has  called  them.   And  they  will  continue to  be treated like second-class citizens  for defending their  homes  and  opposing the sale of their territories to foreign  capital.
