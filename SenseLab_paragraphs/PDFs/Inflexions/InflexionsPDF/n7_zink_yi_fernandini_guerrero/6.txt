DZY:  When  I first  visited the  jungle,  in  2003, the  Harpy Eagle  was  your work’s point  of departure. You placed it at the top of the Amazon’s biological pyramid. I remember the search  for it resembled the way  Freud described his work   with   the   unconscious:   something  that   leaves   traces   and   which   is formulated, or defined, through these  traces,  but  which  never  presents itself to you directly. In fact, during my visit with  you in the jungle,  I never  saw the eagle  and  yet  it took  all of our  attention. Today,  almost  10 years  since  our walk  through the  Madre de  Dios  jungle,  it would seem  that  the  top  of the pyramid has  turned into  the  tip  of the  iceberg,  and  that  the  definition of a concept,   the  Harpy Eagle,  has  become  that  of a  context,  the  Amazon. The latter,  rather than  a pyramidal hierarchy, represents an organic order, a series of significant relationships and dependencies.
