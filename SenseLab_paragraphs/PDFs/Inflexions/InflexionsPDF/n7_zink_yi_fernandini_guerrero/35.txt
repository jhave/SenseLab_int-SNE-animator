conservation of species  in danger of extinction related to the  trees  that  they are certifying. That is, certain  trees,  such  as the Shihuahuaco, become  banned species,  become  protected species.  What  one  must  also  know  is that  when a Shihuahuaco is bought from  a farmer,  or an indigenous person, the latter  are paid  about  100 soles per living  tree. This tree, which  can take from  500 to 600 years  to grow,  in the  US costs  about  30 or 40 dollars per  board-foot, and  in Peru  is only  about  4 soles per  board-foot. That  means  that  in other  countries people are paying for a board-foot what  a green  star  producer is paying the native   communities  for  an  entire   tree!  That  tree  will  be  an  average of  3 thousand feet long, that  is, outside of the Amazon rainforest they  are making
120,000 dollars with  that  tree,  against 38 dollars for  the  whole  tree  in  the jungle.  In general, the problem with  Amazon trees  is that  the natural costs of production of  that  species  have  not  been  assessed. How  are  you  going  to increase  the value  of a tree that  has taken  500 to 800 years  to reach  that  size? In the same way you assess the value  of a pine tree that took 30 years to arrive at  its  dimensions?  The   calculation  doesn’t   work   here,   it’s   incongruous. Nobody is going  to wait or assess the value  of this time, just as nobody would sell us a European or American pine  at a cheap  price.  These are sold at prices that account for their economic and social costs. These people, who know  how to assess the value  of their  products, come here and  want  to pay a pittance for ours.  Things  are not measured by the same  stick, just as not all laws are equal for all people. We need  to raise  awareness in developed countries to change the destiny of our jungle to a more just one.
