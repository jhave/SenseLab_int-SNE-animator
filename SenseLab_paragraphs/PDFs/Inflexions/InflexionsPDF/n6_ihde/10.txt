felt that  Arakawa and  I had  a certain  affinity  of often  unspoken kind.  Madeline remained the  wordster, the  books  show  much   more  her  voice,  and  Arakawa
‘spoke’ a more  gestural language, a body  language. I well remember his delight and  bodily  gestural response to my discussion of at least  three  ways  to play  the variety of flutes from a variety of human orifices, and the laughter enjoyed by all. There  were  also  various gallery  events,  round tables,  sometimes with  Arthur Danto,   another  philosopher  colleague  long   known  to   me   and   clearly   he, recognized as a major art theorist and critic, added to the richness of discussion.
