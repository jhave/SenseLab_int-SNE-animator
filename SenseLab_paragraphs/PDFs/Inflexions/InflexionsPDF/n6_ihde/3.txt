Tokyo, August  2010
Linda   and   I  remained  shocked by  the  news   of  Arakawa’s death  last  May, roughly a decade since we met him and  Madeline Gins in 2001. In this memorial essay  I am  going  to  work  backwards,  chronologically, and  in  the  writing do something of an interpersonal account of his impact upon my own  thinking and philosophy. This  was  Linda’s  first  trip  to Japan.  I had  been  attending the  joint meetings of the Social Studies of Science and  the Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies. In spite  of the  hot  and  humid weather, we  tried  to get  in some  of the  sights  and  (air conditioned) sites  of importance and  these  included the  National Museum  of  Modern Art  which   included displays of  important Japanese artists  by chronological periods. Linda  wondered if Arakawa would be included—and, yes,  for  the  20th   century there   was  a whole room of Arakawa, beginning with  a memorial note of his passing. Most of the art was from his conceptualist period in the 60’s and  through the 80’s, but  there  were  none  of his more  recent  brightly colored architectural designs. Nevertheless we both  felt this was a respectful and  proper sort of “goodbye experience”. Arakawa had  become a famous artistic  ancestor whose  memorial we  had  now  visited. We expressed this  to  others  and  soon  a number of our  international, post  phenomenological friends from  Belgium,  Denmark, and  the  US, also  visited this  museum with  a similar  experience.
