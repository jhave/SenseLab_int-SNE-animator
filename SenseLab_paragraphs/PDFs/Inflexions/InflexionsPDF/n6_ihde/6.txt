Destiny. At this  occasion  my  paper, “Arakawa and  Gins  and  ‘the Philosopher’s Cat’,” noted that  this  was  my fifth presentation on the impact of their  work.  By this  time,  the  focus  of Arakawa had  become  architecture. His  famous park  in Japan,  some Japanese apartments and  Bioscleve House on Long Island  existed  as material objects,  earlier  depicted in bright,  colored drawings. The Arakawa and Gins  approach now  entailed full embodiment engagement as I would call it. The architectural  constructions were   built   in  such   a  way   that   one’s  ordinary or
‘normal’ movements were  placed into demands to re-perceive, re-orient, actively having to undertake more  unusual and  more  extreme styles of motility. That was why  I was  playfully introducing the  philosopher’s cat—Bioscleve  House would be a great  playroom for cats! The uneven floors, the different levels for jumping, the  very  obstructions placed before  humans, would for  cats  be  an  excellent climbing,  jumping   and   hiding  architecture.  For   humans  such   architecture demands exercise,  challenges for bodily  activity  such  that  while  one is still able to do this, one pushes back destiny.
