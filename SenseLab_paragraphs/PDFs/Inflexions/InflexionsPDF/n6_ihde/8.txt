Arakawa’s tubes  and  other  configurations which  often also have  more  than  three stabilities, I knew  he  had  already been  there.  Of  course,  phenomenogically,  I remain puzzled as to why  this is “conceptual” art when it seems  to me that  it is bodily-perceptual  art,  as  active   as  the  most   active   motility  which   animates perception. Echoing  Merleau-Ponty in my Paris paper I claimed “only an embodied being can see in this way, a being who can move, interact, and engage with  things. Depth, multistability, is a feature of active embodiment.” That active, motile perceiving repeats itself in the  instructions Arakawa gives  in the  mechanism of meaning. The arrows in maps,  the deliberate arrangement of x’s and  dots  again bring   forth  the  multiple  perceptual  possibilities of  seemingly  simple arrangements.  Later,   there   is  the  transition  to  more   whole   body   perceptual motility, as with  his Paintings for Closed Eyes. With  these,  the  closed  eye viewer stands on a sloping plane,  in a state  of semi-imbalance which,  unless  corrected for,  could  allow  the  viewer to  topple over.  Similarly,  Perceptual Landing  Sites, engage embodiment in a similar  challenge.
