Now,  back  from  Japan,  into  the  fall  term,  and  now  remembering myself  how once  I had  done  some  art.  As  a graduate student, I painted on  the  side,  then mostly  inspired by  impressionism, pointillism, expressionism, I worked in oils with  palette knife. And  now, only a few years ago, I began  to feel again  a need  to express myself  more  visually, more  bodily,  this  time  with  different inspirations from  those  whom I call ‘constructionists’  such  as Warhol and  Richter.  So now with only a couple  of years before retirement, I have begun the construction of an addition to  our  house   in  Vermont which   will  include a  brightly windowed studio. My question to myself  is: can I simultaneously still ply my own  wordster abilities  in writing, while also engaging in painting, now in a new vein? This, too, resonates with  the decade with  Arakawa and  Gins. The resonance is a matter of perceiving the world, interacting with the world in a certain  way.
