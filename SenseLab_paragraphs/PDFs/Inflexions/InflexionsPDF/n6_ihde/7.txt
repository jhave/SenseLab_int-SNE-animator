This  was  an  important  international conference on  the  work  of Arakawa and Gins with  many  interesting attendees and  participants. My paper there  was “Phenomenology in the Work  of Arakawa and  Gins,”  and  was my most  detailed response to them.  Although Arakawa had  spent  his youth and  early  art training in Japan—with an exceedingly tough post-war set of experiences—he moved to the   U.S.   and    then    also   time   in   Europe,  from   1961.   The   Arakawa-Gins collaborations combined Madeline’s often  enigmatic wordster skills with  his imagistic skills. And  he preceded me with  his own insights into what  I call multistabilty. His early 60’s art, often doing  variations on ‘tubes’ which  visualized multiple three-dimensional effects,  and  then  later  with  the  combined drawings with  equally multistable textual bits in the 1963-1971 series,  “The Mechanism of Meaning,” had  been  unknown to me until  they  sent  me the  catalogue from  the
1997 Guggenheim retrospective. I thought I had  ‘discovered’ multistability in my Experimental Phenomenology (1977) in which  I phenomenologically deconstructed the simply bi- and  sometimes tri-stabilities of classical ambiguous drawings such as Necker  Cubes,  the Muller-Lyer drawing and  the like. So, when I belatedly saw
