White,  blue,  green,  red,  blue,  red,  blue,  white,  violet,  green,  blue,  red,  green, violet,  white  …. The  whole  stage  flickers  in  different colors,  darkness and light banging and  changing rapidly.  Stroboscopic rhythms produce an excess of colour  and  contrast. This is almost  the end of Hiroaki Umeda’s dance performance Haptic. Its beginning is slow: thin  lines of blue  light  are pulsing on  the  ground, different colours  filling  the  stage  evoking a burning bright light.  A light  that  is always excessive  and  always too  much:  too  bright,  too colourful, to fast and  too intense. But not only the light, also the sound of the performance produces excessive  rhythms: it is a collage  of technical sounds, the buzzing of machines, steady high-pitched tunes.  During the whole performance, they produce different levels of staccatic  rhythms and  repetitive patterns. Sound  loops  and  sudden moments of silence  cutting across  and interfering with  the  different movements of light  and  colour.  Again:  these sounds are too loud,  too long, too shrill.  And  the silence  is too silent.  A third rhythm: the moving body  of Hiroaki Umeda. Like the sounds, the movements evoke  the association of machines: Many  movements gear into each other,  set each  other   off  and   produce a  whole   system   of  movements.  The  body:   a production and  product of a movement machine. In Haptic it is not the body, its anatomy and  shape  that connects the movements of the different parts;  it is the   interplay  of   all   these   different  rhythms  that   produce  an   ongoing interference pattern  of  movements. Even  though the  body   freezes   several times  during the  performance,  the  vibratory force  of  movement goes  on, always  pushing  its  own   limits.   The   rhythmic  movements  are   fast   and somehow too fast for the body.
