The  rhythmic patterns in  Haptic do  not  build  a structure or  narration, they rather produce states  – pulsing levels of movement, color, and  sound. There is no climax,  no turning point  only  repetition and  duration. Haptic produces a mode  of sensation, which  effects the  audience in duration and  which  can be linked   to  Okamura Keiko’s  concept   of  “Cold   Burn”  (Teion Yakedo). While being normally burned immediately, Okamura describes the sensation of cold burn  as a slow  change from  a pleasant sensation of warmth to an eventually painful result.  [1] In dance  cold  burn  can  be described as a way  to produce too  much  sensation,  “hyper-sensation”.  Katherine  Mezur  writes:   the performance “produces in  the  viewer/experiencer and  performer a kind  of
‘hyper’ sensation that  results in a low-intensity dull  pain,  a longing, a hurt“ (Mezur  2013).  The  rhythms  of  Haptic  are  not   only   hammering  but   also burning. These are no hot rhythms, they burn  cold in duration and repletion, a repetition that  is not of the same  but of the difference: the contrast of colours, of sounds and movements.
