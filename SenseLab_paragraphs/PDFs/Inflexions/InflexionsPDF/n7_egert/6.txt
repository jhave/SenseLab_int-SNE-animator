In contrast to the bright  colourful floor and  wall  of the stage  Hiroaki Umeda is dressed in  black.  But  Haptic is not  the  dance  of one black  body.  Hiroaki Umeda is not dancing in front of a luminescent wall.  He does  not perform the movements. The  body  exists  in Haptic not  prior  to the  movements, like  the wall exists not prior  to the body.  Wall and  body,  colour  and  black are moving simultaneously and  with  each other.  More precisely: the movements crossing through the  wall  and  body,  body  and  floor,  red  and  black,  and  blue  and green.    They    all   produce   relational  rhythms   across    the    field    of   the performance. [2] What  dances in Haptic is neither the  dancer’s body  nor  the colourful wall,  neither the figure  nor the ground. What  dances is the contrast between them.  “Pure  edge.  Neither black nor  white.  Nor  neither nor  both.  A virtual line”  (Massumi 2011: 89). The contrast (spatial and  temporal) moves rhythmically: the dance  of the virtual line.
