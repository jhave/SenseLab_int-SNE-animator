[2] For  the  concept  of movement not  bound to  one  body  but  as  a “virtual plane  of movement” see Gil 2002. The plane  of immanence “enables the construction of a virtual plane  of movement where all of the  movements of bodies,  objects, music,  colour  acquire a consistency, that  is, a logic or a nexus […]. It also enables the re-organization of movements of the body  without recourse to external elements, since the actual  movements of the body  of the dancer obtain   their  impetus from  the  virtual plane   and  from  the  tensions produced there” (124).
