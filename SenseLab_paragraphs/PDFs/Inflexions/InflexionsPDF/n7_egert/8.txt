movements are  an  ongoing “transformation”, not  from  one  form  to another but  a process  without a beginning or an end.  They  are rhythms of  “de-  and reconfiguration” (Brandstetter 2010: 343). This process  is not  a process  of the body  but of the contrast and  therefore linked  to perception. “The objective extraction  of  identity arises   out   of  movement.  Vision’s  synesthetic  result stands on an oscillating kinesthetic ‘ground’. Perceived stability and  order emerge from  perceptual chaos.  Vision is the process  of that  passage: from  the griddiness of light-struck to the practical grip  of abstract oversight. From  the invisible abyss  of  the  proto-figural to  relative objective   clarity” (Massumi
2011: 97). And  yet: the figure  is not the end of vision,  vision  does  not dissolve in the figure.  Vision is not only processual but  also “double”: “Looking more or less closely, focusing more or less attentively, the eye oscillates  between the annulment  of  the  process   and   its  activity.   Flicker.  Between   fully-hatched stability and  continuing, cracked emergence. Flicker.  Between  the  made  and the making. Flicker. Between  seeing  the figurative stability and  seeing  the imperceptible  float   of   figural    potential”  (Massumi  2011:  93).  Vision   is flickering.  Vision   is  rhythmic.  Vision   is  process.   In  Haptic  vision   is  also durational. We see a dance  of contrast, moving rhythmically between black and  colour,  glowing chaos and  habitual figure,  between pleasant warmth and burning heat.
