[1]  In   2000  Okamura  Keiko   curated  an   exhibition  at   the   Museum  of Contemporary Art Tokyo  titled  Teion Yakedo, Land/mind/body-scapes in the Age of Cold Burn. In the show’s  catalogue she explains the concept  of cold burn: “A cold or low-temperature burn  is a burn  that  results from over-exposure of the skin  to  a  relatively mild  heat  source   […] that  is  not  hot  enough to  cause immediate burning if it is held  next  to  the  skin  for  long  enough period of time. The pain  emerges only gradually as the victim is enjoying a pleasant sensation of  warmth, the  heat  gradually works   into  his  or  her  skin  with eventually painful results. […] The problem with  a cold burn  is that treatment may  be delayed because the effects are felt only gradually, so it may  actually take longer  to heal. Such burns are seldom fatal, but they  cause  real pain.  […] This situation can be compared to life in today's society, where the uneventful repetitions of everyday life can be transformed into sources of pain“  (Quoted in Mezur 2013).
