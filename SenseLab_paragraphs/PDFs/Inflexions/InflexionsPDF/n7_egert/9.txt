There  is no sensation of the  rhythm only  rhythmic sensation. [3] And  yet only a fraction  of sensation in Haptic is immediate. In the dancing rhythms sensations are changing and  emerging in always different and  new ways  in the  duration of the  event.  It is the  alteration in time  that  makes  the contrasts felt. Sometimes they  are  clearly  recognizable but  most  of the  time the   contrasts  are   too   small,   too   fast,   too   big,   too   slow.   Microcontrast.
