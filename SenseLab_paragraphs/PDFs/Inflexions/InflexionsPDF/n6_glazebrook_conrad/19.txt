Arakawa and  Gins  thus  disturb and  dis-place the  dualisms that  underwrite the metaphysics of subjectivity that pervades the ideology of modernity at the foundation  of  consumer  culture.  Their   value   re-orientation,  entailed  in  the refusal  to  die,  re-envisions “concrete ways  in  which  the  body  can  be  actively coupled with  space”  (Hansen 2002: 332). Accordingly, they  offer  promise and hope    through   less   destructive   daily    living.    A   pressing   implication  for sustainability that  has  not  yet  been  explored in the  literature on  Arakawa and Gins  is,  however, exactly   this  refusal   to  die.  We  explore   here  two  of  these implications. The  first  is  that  organisms that  refuse  to  stop  personing cannot enculture  sustainably  if   they   practice  contemporary   WEIRD   consumption patterns.  Secondly, organisms that  refuse  to  stop  personing cannot   enculture sustainably if they reproduce.
