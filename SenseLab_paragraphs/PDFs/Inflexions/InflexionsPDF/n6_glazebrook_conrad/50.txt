Looking  beyond the  global  North to other  cultures is useful  here  because other cultures can  have  parenting practices grounded less in the  nuclear family,  and less in the  strict  division of labour that  prevails in capitalist (hetero)patriarchy, despite the enlightened practices of many  men.  Male participation in and responsibility  for  childcare  remains  the  choice  of  the  benevolent  individual rather than  regular social practice, and  given  the influence and  pervasiveness of advertising and  popular media that  construct gender by  reproducing gender roles  under the  traditional capitalist, (hetero)patriarchal model, that  choice  by men  is an active  practice that  can be difficult  to sustain. How  reversed destiny transforms the  male  experience and  the  experiences of children remains also to be explored in the grand experiment of destiny reversal but  this exploration can be  done,   and   it  invites   and   pushes  towards  imaginative ways   that  are  bold enough to re-negotiate boundaries and  tread into new fields of possibility. Just as Arakawa and  Gins audaciously refuse  to die, organisms that person can refuse  to accept the (hetero)patriarchal models of parenting.
