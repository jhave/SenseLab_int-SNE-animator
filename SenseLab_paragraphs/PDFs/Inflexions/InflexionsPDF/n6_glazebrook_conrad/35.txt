In contrast to the disembodied practices of futurology, Arakawa and  Gins do not propose to  reverse destiny through  technoscientific practices that  separate the body  and  mind. Rather,  they architect spaces  that  maintain integrated wholeness of  organisms  that   person rather than   treating  body   as  passive  matter.  They architect not  just  longevity, but  productivity and  health. Landing in Arakawa- Gins  sites  means  daily  maintenance of circulatory, endocrine and  other  somatic systems such  that   daily   routines and   activities produce  healthily  architected selves  rather than  deteriorating minds trapped in neglected bodies.  As the  pre- retirement   base    shrinks   while    retiree    numbers   grow,    society    becomes increasingly top-heavy and,  moreover, these  elderly draw resources from infrastructural supports like  health-care systems at  greater rates  than  younger people. Arakawa and  Gins make  possible the re-thinking that  renders this  issue moot. Their procedural architecture invites,  even implores, individuals of all ages to reinvent themselves through what  Marty  Rosenberg analyzes as “embodied cognition.” The constant bodily  movement required in a reversible destiny loft, the bioscleave house,  or similar  architectural body  sustains organisms in their personing. Their  project  is  ripe  for  incorporation of  sustainable practices like
