This violent  reduction includes the  exploitation of human resources. From “development,”   which    Shiva    (1988)   diagnoses   as    “maldevelopment,”   a downward spiral  of destruction flows in which  a small  number of capitalists get rich at the expense of the rest of the planet’s inhabitants. As Heidegger argues in the  technology  essay,  all  that   is  (including human  being)   is  encountered  as resource (Bestand) to be stockpiled for future use  (1977a: 26-7/30). Heidegger is most likely referring to the reduction of people to their labour. This is manifest in the extreme in contemporary sweatshop labour, but Heidegger may be thinking, given  that  the earliest  version of this essay was read  at the Bremen  Club in 1949, of the stockpiling of men into the army.  In contemporary WEIRD culture, i.e. consumer  culture,  people  line  up   as  consumers  whose   purchasing  patterns render them  complicit in the  increase  of deteriorating labour conditions, global scarcities,  biodiversity loss, toxin generation, and  greenhouse gas production. Humans who  uncritically accept  consumer culture as destiny are thus  chillingly Darwinian  in  their   complicity  in  their   own   death.  Technoscience, not   just through  its  facilitation  of  commodity production  and   marketing,  but   in  its reductive logic  of  reckonability and  stockpiling, makes   possible the  capitalist order of consumer culture.
