example, almost  100,000 synthetic (i.e. human-made) chemical compounds in use globally  today (Pearce  2010: 35). Humans, and  other  living  things, can expect  to be exposed to some  75,000 artificial  chemicals every  day  in the  air  we  breathe, food  we  eat,  and  particles we  absorb  (Trivedi  2007: 44). Technoscience cannot reverse destiny because it is foundational to the destiny that must  be reversed.
