geographic, though  it  is  also   that.   It  is  conceptual  with   ontological  force, expressed in Parmenides’ claim that being and  thinking are one, and  Heidegger’s “world”: a lived context  of meaning that includes “earth”, i.e. natural entities  and ecosystems as well as built environments, cultural practices, infrastructure…(Heidegger  1962:  93/65).  In  Madeleine  Gins   and   Arakawa’s terms,  the  map  is landing site. Wade  Davis  (2009) names those  who  sustain the knowledge-practice of meaning-making in cultural collectives  “wayfinders,” and he describes and  explains the wayfinders and  wayfinding of indigenous cultures from   across   the   globe.   In  light   of  the   close  connection  he  makes   between wayfinding  and   place,   Glazebrook  once  asked   him   what   hope   remains  for Western culture, given  its foundational idealization of universality that  supports dissociation from  place  or context  of any  kind.  His reply  was  vitriolic,  a rant  on the successes  of contemporary technoscience that  could  easily  be taken  as either praise  or condemnation. Ultimately Davis’ plea is for preservation of indigenous language, culture and  peoples in the hope  that  the human species  might  have  a future after the fall of WEIRD civilization.
