Glazebrook (2000) has  used  Heidegger’s account of Western intellectual history to  establish  the   role   of  modern  science   in  environmental destruction, and provides further analysis of the ways  in which  modern science is an assault upon nature  (Glazebrook 2001).  These  arguments are  not  reproduced here;  rather, analysis is  limited to  technoscientific reduction  of  nature to  resource, which hinges  on nature’s reckonability. When  Galileo  wrote in The Assayer that  nature is a book written in the language of mathematics, he established the foundational assumption of modern science:  quantification is the  a priori (Galelei  2008: 183). Epistemologically, then,  quantification is the sine qua non of knowledge. Ontologically, everything that  is can be subject  to calculation and  reckoned. Is it any  wonder that   in  contemporary  practice, whether  in  the  boardroom of  a Canadian logging company, the hut  of an Indonesian peasant, or the warehouse of Home  Depot,  the forest  appears as nothing more  than  so many  board-feet of lumber? Meanwhile the costs of deforestation, whether to the squirrel as habitat loss,  to  the   peasant’s  wife   as  subsistence  base   destruction,  or  to  the   next generation who  have  one less place  to play  and  one less carbon  sink,  appear as “externalities” at best?
