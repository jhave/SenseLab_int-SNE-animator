mastery,  and   appropriation  as  resource  of  all  that   is,  and   foundational  to modernity, then  reversal means   overcoming this  essence  of  technology. This reversal may  accordingly be the sine qua non of the reversal of destiny Arakawa and Gins call for. In the intellectual tradition of the West, the epoch  of technology is defined as das Abendland, the evening-land whereby consumer culture is “late,” the final configuration of a destiny that began  with  the Greeks.  If the challenge of refusing to die is sustainability, insofar  as indefinite life-expectancy of consumers easily   outstrips  the   planet’s   carrying  capacity,  then   this   challenge  may   be resolved  by  an  alternative  essence   of  technology.  Glazebrook  (2003a,  2004) argues that  alternative technologies that  are  predicated upon cooperation with natural processes, as opposed to assaults on them,  promise sustainability. Sustainable examples include Flowforms, the practice of letting  a field lie fallow rather than  flooding it with  petrochemical fertilizers, as well as the use of bacteriophages versus antibiotics. Glazebrook, like Arakawa and  Gins,  calls for conceptual maps  that  displace modernist assumptions and  concepts toward a new beginning.
