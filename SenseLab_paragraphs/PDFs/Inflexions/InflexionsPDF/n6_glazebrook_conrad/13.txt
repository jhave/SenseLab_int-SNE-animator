To  avoid   such   havoc,   this   paper  explores an  optional  future  with   various conceptual maps.  It does this by examining the implications of reversible destiny within the context  of late capitalism’s map.  We first suggest that  the crisis ethics of  Arakawa and   Gins  offers  an  alternative to  the  capitalist, phallic   order of consumer culture. Secondly, we reveal  the fluidity of the future due  to the tentativeness  of  the   current  states   of  affairs’  destiny  as  history.  Third,   we question  the   global   North’s  unimaginative  definition  of  living,   specifically related  to   technoscience  and    parenting,  in   order  to   search    for   possible alternatives. Ultimately, we conclude that  reversing destiny calls for as much  re- engineering of conceptual space as it does of bodily  process.
