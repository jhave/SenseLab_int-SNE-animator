pointed down and  said  “seven,” noting how  the separation, and  subsequent connection, of  perception and  concept   in  a  naïve  realism has  been  taken  for granted in contemporary human experience. Moreover, self contains radical alterity. At the meeting in Philadelphia, Arakawa asked  Glazebrook if she would recognize her liver if it had  been secretly  removed and  then  offered  to her. What is closest  to the  embodied self is also other.  This demonstrates the  fundamental intent  of Arakawa and  Gins’ architecture to break  down complacency about  the self so that  one can instead hold  oneself  in place tentatively. Reuben Baron notes how   far-from-equilibrium  states   create   transitory  forms   of  disorder through which  “new,  emergent forms  of order” can materialize (2008: 333). These  “shift people from passive, distanced views of the world to an active, participatory way of  engaging the  environment,” (328) and  he  describes how  this  generates an awakening of openness to new  emotional experience. Traditional separations of emotion and   reason are  thus   no  longer   tenable, and   hence  a  crisis  ethics  is possible. In contrast to the demands of objectivity, that  specifically require suspension of attachments, preferences and  other  such  indicators of care, ethics necessitates caring  and other  emotional states.
