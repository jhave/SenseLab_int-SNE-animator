A crucial  challenge for consumer culture, also called  late capitalism, is ecological sustainability. Unfortunately, those  most  empowered to mitigate their  ecological impact,  the  WEIRD  “we,”   are  most   busy   with   unsustainable  practices. This problem is not an inevitable consequence of development, progress or the human condition. Rather,  unsustainable living is at the essence  of consumer culture, and ecodestruction is its direct  result.  Consumer culture is a perfect  storm  of unsustainable practices whose  origins  are historically contingent. This is a good thing,   as  it  means   that  historical destiny  is  not  fixed.  As  Arakawa and  Gins demand, it can be reversed. We (the authors) are not  especially tied  to reversal; that  implies going  the other  way  on the same  axis, and  transformation entails  a more   radical shift  not  so  prone to  dualistic thinking. Some  inversions  may, however, play  a necessary role  in the  transformative process.  For instance, it is necessary and  corrective to  abolish  the  modern scientific  ideology that  others (which  here  is a verb:  to other,  to make  different and  reduce to that  difference) alternative  knowledge  systems  such   as   indigenous   models  or   traditional women’s moral  wisdom (“old  wives’  tales”)  as ignorant and  superstitious. We prefer   multiplicity and  diversity in  the  possibilities of  future histories, as  we cannot  concede  that  there  is one, singular human narrative. Rather,  there  are as many  narratives as there  are landing sites, keeping in mind that  landing sites are shared spaces.
