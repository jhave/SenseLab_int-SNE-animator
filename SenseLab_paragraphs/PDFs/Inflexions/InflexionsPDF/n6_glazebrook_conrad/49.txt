Reversing the destiny of parenting transforms mothering into personing. Women thus  no longer  need  to choose  between parenthood, a career,  or the  exhausting balancing of both,  and  men  are  likewise  freed  toward personing according to self-architected care roles. One consequence of reversed destiny can be an architecting of  parenting in  which   men’s  and  women’s roles  are  much   more similar   than   in  contemporary  practices of  capitalist (hetero)patriarchy  in  the global North.
