generating all kinds  of worries about  non-locality, hidden  variables, and  long- standing philosophical conceptions of causality. We mean  rather a more  general, and  indeed mundane, kind  of quantum entanglement that  happens in the event of measurement. Measurement at such small scale is only possible by reading the results of interaction between small-scale entities.  What  one has is not a distinct, dissimilar  and    separate  measurer  applied  to   what    is   measured,  but   an intervention that  brings  measured and  measurer together so they  interact in one single  event.  Both are changed, constituted anew  in that  event.  Likewise,  in On the Soul, Aristotle describes change:  in seeing,  for example, it may  appear that there  are  two  things, one  seen  and  one  doing  the  seeing  (1984: 34-35). In fact, these   are  just  two   different  aspects  of  one  event:   the  event   of  seeing.   The disruption, the  far-from-equilibrium experience of the  architecture of Arakawa and  Gins,  likewise  smears the  self in landing site such  that  one  cannot  say that the  self is landing site  in an  architectural surround. Rather,  landing site  is the single   event   in   which   self   and   architectural  surround  are   co-constituted. Glazebrook has written elsewhere on the mutual architecting of fetus  and  womb and  considered the  ways  motherhood dissolves self/other  boundaries (Glazebrook 2003).
