Arakawa and  Gins know  that conceptual space is not disconnected from physical space.  That  is why  they  architect not  just  another house,  but  another way  of living,  a crisis ethics—an êthos that  is critical insofar  as it is urgent, but also in its making  possible  critical   analysis  of  the  assumptions  that   underwrite contemporary, unsustainable destiny, in particular, dualisms of body/mind, percept/concept, other/self, emotion/reason, and  nature/human. Concerning body/mind  dualism, in  this  crisis  ethics,  a  landing site  is  always necessarily embodied.  Embodiment  is  the  condition  for  the  possibility  of  landing sites, which  requires and  demands  architecting because it  is  place;  place  is  always physical, regardless  of  whatever else  it  is,  and   it  is  also  always more   than physical. So chatrooms, for example, are  not  places  in the  way  that  classrooms are,  but  they  still  are  grounded in  physical infrastructure, i.e.  a  computer, a router that  gives  wireless access,  a server,  etc..
