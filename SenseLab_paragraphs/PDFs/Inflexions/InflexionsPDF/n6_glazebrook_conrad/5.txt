Jorge  Luis  Borges  tells  of  an  emperor who  orders a  map  of  the  empire. The imperial map-makers present their  work,  but  the  emperor sends  it  back—the map  is not  precise  enough. The map-makers make  it more  precise,  and  present the  better,   more   exact,  and   hence   bigger   copy;  but  the  emperor is  still  not satisfied. Several  tries  later,  a map  is produced that  is so precise  it is an  exact replica  of the  empire. They  spread it across  the  empire so the  emperor can  see how  accurate and  complete it is. The emperor is pleased. Yet where are they  to keep  this  giant  map?  “Let’s  just  keep  it spread out  on  the  empire,” suggests a young map-maker, “it’s  a perfect  fit.”  So they  do,  and  now  all  the  people go about  their  business walking on  the  map  like  a giant  carpet.  Time  passes.  The people forget  they  are walking on the map.  The empire changes. Rivers shift; mountains rise,  others   erode.   The  map  becomes   more  and  more  wrong. The people cannot  understand why  it is so hard to find their way. Why does it rain in the desert, while our crops die of drought in the valley? The people are lost. They need  a new map.
