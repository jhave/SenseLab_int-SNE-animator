A further sustainability challenge remains for  Arakawa and  Gins:  re-inventing ourselves  entails   recognizing  the   limits   of  our   older   maps.   It  involves  re- examining, re-evaluating, and  re-structuring our  lives at even  the most  intimate levels.  Re-invention is  future-oriented  restoration focused on  our  capacity to aspire  (Appadurai 1996: 59), build,  and  strengthen as an  alternative to technoscience’s tendencies to exploit,  dominate, and  devalue. Of all possible alternatives inspired by  Arakawa and  Gins,  reversing the  destiny of parenting may  perhaps be the  most  future oriented. Indeed, the  architecture of Arakawa and  Gins faces a particular challenge with  respect to sustainability when it comes to   reproduction.  The   planet’s   resources  are   finite.   As   an   issue   in   inter- generational  justice,   how   are   resources  to  be  managed  such   that   the   next generation gets its turn,  its share  in using  them?   The previous sections  suggest that  reversing destiny entails  architecting out  of consumer culture. This reduces the  immediate threat to sustainability, but  in the  long  term,  and  Arakawa and Gins intend a very  long  term  indeed, sustainability cannot  be achieved with  the continuing increase  in human population. Contemporary global  issues  in sustainability may  be rooted in inequitable resource access and  distribution and poor   consumption  patterns,  but  even  if  it  is  not  already,  sustainability  will eventually become  an issue of population and carrying capacity.
