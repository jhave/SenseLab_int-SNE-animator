The   consequences  of  such   an   arrangement  would  be   immense.  Gendered divisions of labour between parents would be undermined. Children would not necessarily be less loved;  rather, the pressures of sole responsibility for meeting all   the   needs   of  the   same   child   or   children  might   actually  promote  less dysfunction  than   the   contemporary  experience  of  parenting  allows,   given poverty rates  and  the  labour burden of parenting even  in the  planet’s  affluent societies.  Plato/Socrates argued that  “no-one could  deny  that  it  would be  an immense advantage for  the  wives  and  children to  be  common to  all”  (4257d) Certainly for women, Plato  suggested that  the communal approach to parenting allows  that  “women are to be put  on the same  footing  as men”  (466c) insofar  as they should “engage in the same pursuits” (454e) and  “share in whatever is to be done” (451e). Concerning governance in particular, “natural gifts are to be found here  and  there,  in  both  sexes  alike”  (455d).  Assumptions of gender difference that  go beyond procreative function have  historically justified patriarchal domination of women. Communal parenting opens  possibilities for childcare to be a capacity in everyone’s personing.
