Landing site  is thus  much  more  than  the  traditionally conceived “self”—it  is a loss of subjectivity and objectivity that can be understood by analogy to quantum entanglement.  What   we   mean   here   is   not   just   the   particular  version  of entanglement  made    famous  in   Einstein’s   thought  experiments  (1935)  and measured in tests  of Bell’s inequalities (1964; cf. d’Espagnat 1979), in which  the momentum or spin  of one particle is inseparable from  the other.  Paired particles are  so  entangled that  measurement of one  determines the  value  of the  other,
