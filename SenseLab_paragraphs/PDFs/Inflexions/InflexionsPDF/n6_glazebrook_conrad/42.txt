Think  of what  it would mean  to elementary school  children to be greeted thus  by  their  new  teacher at  the  beginning of the  school year: “Children, I can fairly well promise you that if you study hard and  always strive  to know  the full range  of the body’s capabilities, you  will  in  all  probability not  have  to  die”  (Arakawa and  Gins
2006).
