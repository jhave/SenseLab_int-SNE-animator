It is important to note  that  there  are potential reproductive injustices associated with  reversible destiny,  in  that  organisms that  person may  have  a  desire   to reproduce compromised by sustainability issues.  It is important here  to be clear about  the object of the ethical issue. If future generations will not be born because of  the  cost  of  reversed destiny, it  may  seem  that  inter-generational justice  is breached due  to the denial of life to yet-to-be-born future generations. However, if future generations have  a right  to  life, even  before  they  are  conceived, then every  woman must  have  a moral  obligation to realize  the life potential in every egg  in  her  body.   This  reductio ad absurdum  makes   clear  that  that  the  ethical implications of reversed destiny fall, as an inter-generational justice issue,  not to the  children who  will  never  be  born,  but  to  the  children who  are  born  into  a world that  may  compromise their  reproductive choices.
