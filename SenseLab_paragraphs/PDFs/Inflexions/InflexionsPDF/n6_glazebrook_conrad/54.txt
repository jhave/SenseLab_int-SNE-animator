In  conclusion, Rosencrantz and  Guildenstern, which  is to  say,  Tom  Stoppard, may have  unwittingly passed an accurate judgment on consumer culture: “just a conspiracy of cartographers, then?”  (Stoppard 1967: 77). Arakawa and  Gins  are wayfinders that  open  new  maps  by insisting that  in an existential condemnation to be free, organisms that  person are inescapably cartographers. Not  trapped in the inevitability of history, personing organisms are landing site on and  in a map they  tentatively hold  in  place.  Reversing consumer culture, technoscience and (hetero)patriarchy entails  ontologies and  praxes  of cooperation rather than conquest: a new way to think  existence.  Human experience is not just bodied but embodied; that is, the self is phenomenologically located  as a body  that thinks, an organism  that    persons.   Architecting  the   self-organism  that    persons  is   a conceptual  issue   that   Fionn   Bennett   aptly   called   “autopoetics”  in  the  Paris Arakawa-Gins sessions  of 2005—an architecting of experience in which  self and other,   whether human or  non-human,  family  or  stranger, are  a  mutual and complicit weaving of landing site. Reversing destiny means  remapping landing site  in  shared communities of life.  Reversing destiny is, then,  conceptual and embodied. We have  argued that  Arakawa and  Gins  provide understanding of the cartographic nature of landing site that  offers a way  out of consumer culture toward sustainable presencing, and  functional possibilities for  social  dynamics based  on  reversing the  (hetero)patriarchal discipline of parenting. As a closing gesture toward future development of this line of thinking, we suggest that  their work  cannot,  then, but be political—and peace politics  at that.
