such  that  some  hope  might  come  from  within the Western intellectual tradition. Arakawa and  Gins  are  just  such  hope—a crisis  ethics  that  builds a new  map, reversing destiny by  deciding not  to die.  But, the  thing  is—the  hard part—we have  to  do  it ourselves. They  teach  that  we  are  all  map-makers. We  are  each already on the  map,  which  is to say in the  map,  that  is, we are the  map.  So we have  to make  the map,  which  we are always already in, where we already stand, which  is on nothing, under nothing, and understanding even less. What we have, then,  is  a  tentative ‘holding-in-place’:  a  place  to  hold  on  to,  a  cleaving while already under and on the way. And we are always on the way.
