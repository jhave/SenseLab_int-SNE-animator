Moreover, the activity  of living  in the architected spaces  of Arakawa and  Gins is thus  “engaged bodily  activity” (2008: 340).  The embodied, personing organism engages with  the environs as constant, aware interaction. It thus  simply does  not make   sense   conceptually  to  separate  what   is  human  from   what   is  nature. Organisms that   person are  natural entities   that   eat  and   breathe in  constant interaction with  their  environment.   An  organism that  persons is  a  tentative “holding-in-place”  that   is  in  uninterrupted  exchange with   the  ecosystem in which  it is embedded.
