One  of the  most  important lessons  that  biology  can  offer  all forms  of thinking (whether scientific,  philosophical, or  artistic)  is the  usefulness of “robustness” and  not  “clarity” as an  explanatory strategy. Despite the  enthusiastic claims  of some  [7], biology  has  always cobbled together its epistemology. In biology  we find  room  for  diagrams, stories,  quantification, tables  of  data,  codes,  schema, films, models, and  animations. Understanding a cellular  process  often  requires a researcher to move  from biochemical formulas, to diagrams, to tabulated data,  to space  filling  animations, to narratives of evolution and  development. If physics aspires to be the  science  of enlightenment thinking based  on  clear  and  distinct thought  [8],  then   biology   best   aspires  to  be  the   science   demonstrating  the baroque value  of the  robustness of multiple explanatory frameworks. Because  of this,  biological  explanations produce nomadic spaces  where distinctions such  as inside  and  outside are often  less privileged than  identifying points of inflection, creative in-betweens—in-between the  cell and  its environment, the  natural and the artificial,  the living and  nonliving, the plant  and  the animal, the experimental and the explanatory.
