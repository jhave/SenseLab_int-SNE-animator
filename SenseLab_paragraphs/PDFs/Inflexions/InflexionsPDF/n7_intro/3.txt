“…  keeping  in   mind  [Claude]  Bernard’s   formula  that   ‘life  is creation’,  we  will  say  that  the  knowledge of life must  take  place through   unpredictable   conversions,  as   it   strives    to   grasp  a becoming whose  meaning is never  so clearly  revealed to our understanding as when it disconcerts us” (Canguilhem 2008: 22).
