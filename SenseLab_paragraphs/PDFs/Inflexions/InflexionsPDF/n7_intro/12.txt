study of biology  is  so  important. Biology  should be  viewed as  an  exemplary practice   because   it   offers    important   lessons    for   studying   all   types    of phenomenon, organic and  nonorganic, as participants in and  through duration. Drawing a hard and  fast line between vital and  non-vital processes only ends  up contributing to the  understanding of biology  as a special,  less rigorous, form  of scientific  knowledge. Finally—and this is not so much  a difference from Bergson, but   an  emphatic  extension  of  his  idea   of  “intellect”  and   its  relationship  to instinct—we believe  that  thought takes  many  forms,  few  of them  intrinsically human,  and   each   of  these   forms   offers   own   ways   of  engaging  with   and processing the world.
