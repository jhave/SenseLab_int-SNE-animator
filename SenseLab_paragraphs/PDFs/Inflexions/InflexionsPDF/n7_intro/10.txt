According to Henri  Bergson,  the type  of intellectual approach outlined above  is especially appropriate  for  the  study of  living  beings.  Since  all  things already actively  participate in space  and  time,  to conceive  of them  as material extended through an  a priori  space  inverts the  inherently creative relationship between mind and  material, and  renders it mechanistic. Conceiving of things as objects forces perception to “step  out  of duration” and  separates mind from  matter and things  from   percepts  (Bergson   1911:  218).  Although  applying  this   type   of inverted thought to  inanimate things can  be  fruitful (as  it is in  some  form  of physics),  it  mischaracterizes  vital   processes  as  overtly  mechanistic.  What   is important about  Bergson’s  insight for  our  argument is that  he  doesn’t  directly distinguish living  and  non-living matter by two different types  of qualities, such as  an  essential vital  essence,   what   Georges   Canguilhem would  call  animism (2008: 122), but  by two  different types  of explanations of order, one  of finality and  ideal clarity  (for example, those characterized by the enlightenment) and  one of irreducibility and duration (what  we’ve been calling the baroque).
