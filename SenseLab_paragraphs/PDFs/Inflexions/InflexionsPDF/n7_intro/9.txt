Alfred  North  Whitehead, Deleuze, and  Isabelle  Stengers, among others,   have shown is  that  metaphysical  generalization  is  itself  a  creative process.   In  her Thinking with Whitehead, Stengers explains that, for Whitehead, metaphysical concepts “do  not  designate a  world that  exists  prior   to  them   but,  quite   the contrary, they  bring  into  existence  what  Deleuze and  Guattari call an ‘image of thought’” (Stengers 2011a: 267). And  so what  we require is an image  of thought, or  “the  image  of thought gives  itself  of what  it means  to think” (Deleuze and Guattari 1994: 37), in which  thought itself becomes  more vital.
