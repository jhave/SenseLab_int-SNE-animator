[3] Despite the surge  of interest in notions of emergence, complexity, and  process among certain   cultural and  philosophical theorists of  science  and  technology indebted to Deleuze and  Félix Guattari, Isabelle Stengers, Donna Haraway, et al., this   still   remains  far   indeed  from   the   dominant  discourse  of  professional philosophers of science.  So for example, while  life as an  emergent phenomena has  become   a  popular  discourse in  Anglo-American philosophies  of  science, Mark A. Bedau notes  that strong theories of emergence, in which  the cause of the emergent property cannot  be identified, is “uncomfortably like magic,”  and  is an unacceptable explanation for life scientists (cf. Bedau 1997). Emergent phenomena—such as “life”—cannot be irreducible to the more basic phenomena. For a discussion of analytical notions of emergence and  their  relation to theories of  life  in   speculative  sciences   of  life,  see   Nocek,   “Imaginative  Chemistry: Synthetic Ecologies  and  the  Construction of  Life”  (Nocek  2014). There  are  of course   exceptions  to  this   rule,   Francisco   Varela,   Stuart   Kauffman,  Richard Lewontin, and  Susan  Oyama come to mind, but even here there  is a kind  of conservatism that  undergirds each  of their  theories:  life is self-maintenance (cf. Shaviro  2009).
