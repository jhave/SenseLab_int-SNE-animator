What   characterizes  biology   is  that   gothic   and   baroque  moments  may   be generated from  within the  spaces  and  times  of biological  thinking. They  do  not pre-exist, as if the  discipline itself  articulated the  means  for such  thinking, but they  must  be intensively created as an  order of the  intermingling of mind and material. When  Deleuze and  Guattari write  about  nomadic science in A Thousand Plateaus, this is not in order to isolate  it as a stable  end  or goal that  opposes state science.   Nomad  science   is  an   ambulant  procedure  for  setting   variables  in continuous variation that  can never  be absolutely separated from  its royal formalization.  The  former  is  not  an  identifiable  thing,   but   a  process,   never localizable; always in the process  of being created, never  fully started, never  fully finished—it is virtual. As such,  the  essays  collected  here  all generate nomadic moments within biological  thinking about  life. But in so doing,  they don’t simply destabilize pre-established categories, but  create  virtual dimensions within biological  thinking that  are themselves living  and  can be felt through the gothic nature of  their  presence. To  animate biophilosophy, then,  is  to  produce vital thinking through biological  thought that can then suggest possible new strategies for understanding the relationship of mind to all materials.
