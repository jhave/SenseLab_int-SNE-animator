(Lambert 2004), Angela   Ndalianis (Ndalianis 2005) and  others.   Most  of  these authors are indebted to the formal  strategy developed in Henri  Focillon’s The Life of Forms, which  looks at forms  of thought and  creation as dynamic and  changing (Focillion  1947). As Deleuze emphatically notes,  “The  Baroque  refers  not  to an essence  but rather to an operative function” (2006: 3). It is also important to point out  here  that  much  of the  explicit  or  implicit  argument is that  the  values  that mark   much   enlightenment  thought  were   special   cases   in  a  history  overall marked  by  the   baroque.  This  is  possible  because  the   Baroque,   through  its embrace of heterogeneity, can accommodate the enlightenment as a special  case of Baroque  thought.
