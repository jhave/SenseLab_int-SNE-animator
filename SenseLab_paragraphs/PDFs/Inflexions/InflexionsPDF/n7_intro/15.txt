biochemical  architecture,   Henning   Schmidgen’s  life   of   concepts,   Deborah Leavitt’s media-ethology of animation, Phillip  Thurtle’s investigation into the use of layers  in animation, or Eugene Thacker’s  challenge to the very  concept  of life, each project  finds  a way  to problematize the incompossibility of worlds in order to set thought into  continuous variation. Here  we  find  inspiration in Deleuze’s use  of Jorge  Luis  Borges’s  story  “The  Garden of Forking Paths” to  radicalize Gottfried Liebniz’s  theory of compossibility beyond its theological restraints. For Liebniz,  all universes are  possible in and  through God  as long  as there  are  no contradictory elements between them  that  make  them  “incompossible.” It is God then  that assures we live in this world, the best of all possible worlds, as opposed to any  other  world. The Borges story  allows  Deleuze to change Liebniz’s  notion of difference away  from specific differences to differences of singularities. In Liebniz’s formulation, difference is seen as the contradiction between specific identities. Deleuze, however, builds his model  of difference on singularities and not  identities: “[Singularities] are not  generalities,” writes  Deleuze, “but  events, or  droplets of an  event” (2006: 73). This  allows  for  the  unfolding of series  of events  as contingent branching chains,  where robust intersections resonate. [9] This is important as models of difference based  on general identity uphold the principle of non-contradiction as the  dominant principle of “clear  and  distinct” reasoning. These  models prove  insufficient when thinking in terms  of dynamic processes because they  embrace compossible models of difference. Change, at some  point,  recognizes the  importance of thinking difference as repetition and not contradiction in order to express a world in process.
