The  project  of Animating  Biophilosophy begins  with  a different assumption: that contemplating life is best accomplished by making thought more  like living processes, by  somehow encouraging thought to  move,  sense,  and  respond. [5] Putting thought in motion means  encouraging an especially restless  brand of philosophy, a philosophy that is not completely comfortable with  its starting premises and  not  ever  finished when creation has  reached its  limits.  This  is a type  of  thought more  often  associated with  the  vagaries of  baroque than  the clarity  of the  enlightenment. Thought must  create  rhizomes, where there  is “no beginning or end…  always in the  middle, between things, intermezzo”  (Deleuze and  Guattari 1987: 25). Thought needs  to  come  and  go,  as  Gilles  Deleuze and Félix Guattari write,  rather than  start  and  finish;  and  it does  so, not  by finding the   middle  between  two   points,  the   “average,”  but   by  creating  a  middle, “fabulating” it—rhizomes must  be created, not  found. Orientation in thought is not  a  question of  exactitude, then;  it  is  a  question of  “anexactitude,” where “anexactitude is  in  no  way  an  approximation; on  the  contrary it  is  the  exact passage of that which  is under way”  (1987: 20).
