Finally, Whitehead's speculative theory of the function is self-referentially inclusive and can define  itself as a finite, revisable or fallible, and non-exclusive construction. It is real so far as it can be consistently and  comprehensively constructed or applied (1898: 5-12,
1978: 3-4) and it is ideal and  hypothetical so far as, in the nature of the case, there can be
no final construction, application, or exclusion of alternatives in an infinitely proceeding, aeviternal reality.  Thus Whitehead is a constructivist to the extent  that he denies the applicability of the principle of bivalence to speculative descriptions (1978:
8), and  he replaces the traditional concept of “proof” with  that of the “working
hypothesis” that does not negate  alternative analyses (1978: xiii, 7-9; 1967b: 222-223). Yet his fallibilist  theory of construction does not lead him to deny  the principle of tertium
non datur, the principle that there can be no circumstances in which  a speculative claim
can be recognized as being absolutely undecidable or absolutely neither provable nor refutable (1978: 7-9, 274-75). [20] As itself an historically-situated, finite construction, the speculative theory of functional activity  has no “pretensions to the achievement of final truth”, which  Whitehead regards as “pathetic” (1947: 125).
