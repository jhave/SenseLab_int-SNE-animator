In Process and Reality, Whitehead develops his position by the elaboration of a “speculative scheme” (1978: 3) or “matrix” (1978: 7-8) of categories, which,  after the style of Principia Mathematica, he presents and defines  at the start of the work.  There, he defines his “category of the ultimate” (1978: 21-22) as a matter of 'creativity, many,  one'. Creativity is said to be 'the ultimate principle', whereby 'the many  become  one and are increased by one'.
