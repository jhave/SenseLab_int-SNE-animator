Speculative as opposed to analytical philosophy is centrally concerned with  the concept of activity,  understood as the activity  of actualization which  makes  things what  they
are. Moreover, speculative philosophy has characteristically maintained that the activity of actualization is self-explanatory in the sense that it is defined in terms  of a distinct kind of entity  (substance, God, the Absolute) which  has necessary existence  or whose existence  is not derived from anything except itself. It will be argued here that the hitherto unrecognized significance of Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947) [1] resides in the fact that he fuses together a speculative philosophy of activity  and  logical analysis
by drastically reinterpreting the nature of the mathematical function and redefining the self-explanatory in terms  of the applicability or descriptive adequacy of his functional analysis to the nature of things.
