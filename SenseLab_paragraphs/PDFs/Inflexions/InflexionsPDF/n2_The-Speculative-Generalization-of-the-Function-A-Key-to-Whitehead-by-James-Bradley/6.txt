It is no accident that Whitehead describes philosophy as “imaginative generalization” (Whitehead, 1978: 5), and  sees his thought as a “generalized mathematics” (1947: 109). He states  that “the algebraic method” - the “examination of pattern with  the use of real [free or unquantified] variables” (1947: 130-31) - is the rubric  under which  he elaborates his speculative philosophy, and he insists  that “Logic prescribes the shapes of metaphysical thought”. [2] What he means  by this is evident throughout Process and Reality (1929), which  is the revision and  culmination of his earlier  mathematical and philosophical work,  in particular his collaboration with Bertrand Russell in Principia Mathematica (1910-12). For in Process and Reality and  subsequent writings, Whitehead builds on the brilliant success of the Frege-Russell generalization of the mathematical function and develops his philosophy on that basis.
