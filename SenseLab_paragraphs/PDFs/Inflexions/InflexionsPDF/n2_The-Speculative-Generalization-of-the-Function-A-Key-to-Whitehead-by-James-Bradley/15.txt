Whitehead is here rejecting  the view that the concept of set is the basic concept, and  that the function is to be defined in terms  of sets of ordered pairs  of a certain  sort. His claim is that the generalized concept of mapping as the mapping of order is distinguishable from that of any specific order, for it is the process whereby order is generated.
Mapping is not any set of ordered pairs,  but the concept of the ordination of order, of
the ordering of pairs into sets. It is not any specific relation or rule, but the concept of
the configuration of any specific relation or rule. It is not any specific difference or form, but the concept of the differentiation of difference, the formation of forms. In consequence, as the very term suggests, the concept  of mapping in general is the
concept of an activity.  Because mapping is distinguishable from the domain out of which it proceeds, from the codomain to which  it proceeds, and  from any relation or rule which  it establishes as such, the concept of mapping is the concept of the activity  of actualization as the actualization of relations or rules. The concept of mapping is the concept of mapping activity,  and it is not reducible to, explicable by, or exhaustively analyzable in terms  of, any of its components. It is the ultimate, underivable condition
of transformation or composition, the universal principle of construction or
actualization, understood as the activity  of establishing a relation between the structure of a result  and its bases.
