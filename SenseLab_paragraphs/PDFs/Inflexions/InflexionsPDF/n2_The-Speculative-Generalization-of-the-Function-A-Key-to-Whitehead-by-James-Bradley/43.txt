One obvious feature of Whitehead's speculative generalization of the function as mapping activity  is that it criticises  logical analysis in all its forms for completely taking for granted the “invariableness” or “self-identity” both of the connectives and  of the variables of the function (1947: 127-28; 1968: 106-107). In other  words, he holds functional analysis to be too closely tied to the view that the connectives and  variables
of a function in its different instantiations are merely  numerically different. This means
that there  has been no proper consideration of what  may be involved in the topic- relativity of the concepts of connective and variable, which  is arguably implicit  in the fact that the function is meaningless apart from its instances. The claim is that the usual accounts of functional analysis are basically  aristotelian in interpreting the function as merely numerically different in its instances. The only difference is that 'substance' has been neutralized into an instance of a variable. Thus Whitehead's functional analysis is not only a generalization of the mathematical-logical function; it is also a critique of the standard interpretation of the mathematical-logical function in that it rejects the metaphysically-loaded use of the term 'constant', understood as that which  is fixed, in contrast to the term  'variable', understood as a mere gap waiting to be filled. For Whitehead, the function as employed and  usually understood in mathematics and logic is a highly  abstract and by no means fundamental product of conscious occasions of many-to-one mapping (1967b: 254).
