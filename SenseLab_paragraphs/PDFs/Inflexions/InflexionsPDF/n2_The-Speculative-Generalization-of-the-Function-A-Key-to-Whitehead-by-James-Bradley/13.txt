First, the definition of the function as the class of many-to-one relations aligns  the analysis of the function with  the philosophical question as to the nature of plurality and unity,  thereby lifting the concept of the function to the highest level of metaphysical generality. When Whitehead defines the ultimate by reference to many-to-one relations, he is at once laying  out the fundamental issue which  a philosophical account of the nature of the function must  address, and  defining the concept of the ultimate as the concept of the function in general.
