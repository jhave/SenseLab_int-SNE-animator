least the following characters: they are asymmetrical as many-to-one constructions; they are transitive, in that the relations between them  are many-to-one relations; they are connected, in that they have predecessors; they are consecutive in that their immediate predecessors are occasions;  and  they stand in a “cumulative” relation to their predecessors (1978: 237), for, as iterative, they 'contain' their predecessors in their domains. [13] In the nature of the case, there is no such thing  as a single, solitary occasion (1967a: 174), and because any occasion  stands in a cumulative route  of iterations, it necessarily has a complex domain. In other  words, it is akin to what mathematicians call a 'functional', at least in the sense that its domain (and thus  its codomain as well) is constituted by sets of functions or mappings. The concept of series of occasions can thus  be regarded as an ontological generalization and constructivist reinterpretation of the Plato-Frege theory of numbers as serial relations, for it installs serial relationality as an intrinsic feature of the nature of things by defining both an occasion  and  its relata  as many-to-one configurations or connectives in series. [14] In the iterative series, that is, occasions switch  roles from being a successor mapping, or synthetic subject, to being the predecessor, object, or basis, and  thus  the subject or argument, of a consequent successor mapping. The result  is that subject and  object, as well as subject and  predicate, are not here fixed ontological opposites (1978: 157-59,
1967b: 175-77). They are not fundamentally different in nature or kind.  Rather,  they are
the basic states  or sequential relations of occasions  of iterative mapping.
