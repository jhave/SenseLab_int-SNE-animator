In consequence, any occasion  of the infinite  mapping activity  of differentiation is not merely  a transitive configuration but an intransitive difference or singularity. That is, any finite instance of infinite  mapping activity  is irreducible to any or all of its conditions and is qualitatively different from any other  instance because it is, to the extent defined, self-actualizing; it is novel because it is a 'never  before'; and it is unique in the sense that its activity  is unrepeatable - it is a 'never  again'  as well as a 'never  before'. Whitehead's ontological generalization of the function here provides a way of elaborating a theory of difference, singularity, or haecceitas from within functional structure itself, independent of the problems of reference presented by standard functional analysis (as in Charles Peirce or Russell).
