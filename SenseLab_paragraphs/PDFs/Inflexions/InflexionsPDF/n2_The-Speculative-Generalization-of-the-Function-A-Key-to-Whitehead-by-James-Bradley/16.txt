What Whitehead has done  here is to begin the generalization of the meaning of the function exactly where Frege does: with  the concept of mapping. [6] But he does not follow the extrinsic  Neo-Kantian limitation Frege lays upon his generalization, which defines mapping as the 'thought' or concept in general and thus  restricts it to a theory of cognition. Instead, Whitehead develops the dynamical aspect  of the concept  of the function, which  in Frege makes  it the principle of cognition and in Russell makes it the principle of logical construction out of sense-data, and he  unrestrictedly generalizes it over any relation or order. The claim is that, just as there  is a distinction between a mapping rule and its particular applications, so also there is a distinction between the activity  of mapping and a particular mapping rule, and it is this all-important
distinction which  is lacking  in the tradition of logical analysis. In other  words, the
Frege-Russell generalization of mapping is an insufficient or improper generalization of the meaning of the function in that it treats  functional mapping as nothing other  than  a matter of particular mapping rules.  Mapping is indeed absolutely inseparable from particular rules, as will become  apparent. But the point  is that the proper generalization of the meaning of the function as the activity  of mapping in general discloses at the very heart  of functional analysis the ineradicability and irreducibility of the concept of the activity  of actualization, now defined as the mapping activity  of differentiation. The concept of the ultimate or the function in general is equivalent to the mapping of a
