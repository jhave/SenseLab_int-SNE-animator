First, from the nature of mapping as an activity  which  is the universal principle of construction and  is ultimate in that it is not derivable from any higher concepts, it follows  that it is a particular kind  of ultimate principle: as the universal principle of the structuration of structure, “all characters are more  special  than  itself” (1978: 31). This means  that,  as the highest description possible of the nature of the function, the concept of universal mapping activity  is not a generic  property or universal but a supra-generic property or universal. In other  words, it is 'characterless' in the positive sense that it is a nondetermining property or predicate, and the claim is that it is universally applicable to any specific determination. [8] Universal mapping activity  is thus  properly to be described as a transcendental property in the Kantian sense, for it is that activity  of actualization which  is a ground or condition of any determination. More precisely, it is
a condition of any other  transcendental predicates there  may be, as well as of all real or
generically determining properties or predicates. In short: universal mapping activity  is
“the universal of universals” (1978: 21).
