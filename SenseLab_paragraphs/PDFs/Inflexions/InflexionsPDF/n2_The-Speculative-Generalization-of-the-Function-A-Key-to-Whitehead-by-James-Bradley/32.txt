Infinite  mapping is essentially relative to its instances, and  its primary instance is divine mapping to general potentiality. General potentiality is in its turn  essentially relative to its finite instances, which  Whitehead calls 'actual  occasions' of mapping (where 'actual'
is the adjectival form of 'act'). On account of the essentially incomplete, interdependent,
and  correlative nature of these three  basic elements in his ontological generalization of the function, Whitehead can say that “Finitude is the condition of activity” (1947: 105-6).
