Divine  mapping or “valuation” (1978: 31) is held  to be “infinite” in that it is not limited by any determinate actuality, and in this respect is also “free” (1978: 345): that is, it is a causa  sui in respect of how it maps  to structure (1978: 88, 222). Here Whitehead stands close to the British voluntarist tradition: “no reason  can be given for just that limitation which  it stands in [God's]  nature to impose” (1967a: 178). However, there is no subscription to the voluntarist notion of an ineffable  divine act of will. Divine  mapping involves no conscious act on the part  of God: it is a necessity of His nature to impose structure upon possibilities as an instance of universal mapping (1978: 345). Whitehead's intention here is to avoid  both the anti-rationalist tendencies of voluntarism and  the problem of impredication which  Russell's  Paradox might  raise for
the concept of a divine mind - or any mind - which  surveys all orders of possibility. [10]
