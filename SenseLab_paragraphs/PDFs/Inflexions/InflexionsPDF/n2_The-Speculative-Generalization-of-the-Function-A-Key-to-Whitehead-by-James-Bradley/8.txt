Whitehead's generalization of the function makes  the claim that the generalized function has 'ultimate' status. This means in part  that, with  Gottlob  Frege, Russell, and  the early Wittgenstein, he regards the generalized function as irreducible (as not further definable or derivable from any higher principle), and as transcendental (as universal in range  or application). However, Whitehead's transcendental theory of the function is a theory, not of cognition, but of the constitution of all order. Moreover, the claim to the irreducibility of the generalized function rests not on an appeal to any kind  of a priori rational intuition, nor is it a matter of its logical 'primitivity', for in Whitehead the ultimacy of the generalized function is not such that it could  be held to be inexplicably given.  Rather,  his generalized description is intended to establish the function as irreducible by showing it to be a particular kind  of self-explanatory ultimate, which  he terms  'process' or 'creative process'. The way he sets about  establishing this extraordinary claim is best explained in a series of three  steps. The first step considers the concept of creativity in its own right  as 'the category of the ultimate'.
