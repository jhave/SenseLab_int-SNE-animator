mapping from many  eternal objects to one structure is defined as the operation of the
'primordial nature' of God, on the aristotelian principle that there  must  be something in act to realize  form or potency (1978: 32). God maps  from “the many  eternal objects conceived in their bare, isolated multiplicity” (1978: 349; cf. 1967a, Chapter X) to their unity  in an ordered infinity of possible mutual relations which  is all-embracing, non- exclusive, and  non-selective. This unity  is not a fixed, necessary ideal order to which  all things must  approximate (1978: 84), but is a matrix  of all possible orders or relations which,  in a late essay, Whitehead describes under Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer's concept of a “spread involving an infinitude of dimensions” relative to any finite determination (1947: 88). Whitehead's conceptualism holds  at the same time that universals are reals and  that they need  to be ordered by a constructive act of divine mapping.
