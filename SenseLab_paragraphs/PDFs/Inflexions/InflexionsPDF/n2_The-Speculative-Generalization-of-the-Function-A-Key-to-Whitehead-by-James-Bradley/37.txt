There are, however, fundamental differences between Whitehead's and  Wittgenstein's theories of functional process. One difference is that, whereas in Wittgenstein the base of an operation is an elementary proposition which  is not generated by the application of the operation, in Whitehead's account of finite mapping there  are no irreducible logical atoms:  there  are only complex  occasions of mapping. The crucial difference, however, is between Whitehead's theory of functional process  as essentially a matter of activity  and what  Wittgenstein graphically calls an 'automatic' (algorithmic) process, understood as describable independently of any appeal to a principle of activity  in the speculative sense.
