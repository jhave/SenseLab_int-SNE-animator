mapping, “novelty”, and synthesis or “togetherness” (1978: 21). God's  primordial nature is held  to be inseparable from his 'consequent nature', by which  he maps  from occasions  to their timeless preservation and redemption, and  the consequent nature is held  to be given  to the world as part of the domain of each occasion  (1978: 87-88, 351). Finally, each occasion  is triadically analyzed in terms  of a given domain, its private synthetic act as a causa sui, and its public  or communal role as an object of a successor occasion  (1978: 87-88). [18] It is by way of this unusual analysis of the complex  structure of functional activity  that Whitehead would explain what  for Frege and logical analysis is indemonstrable: the existence  of value-ranges or sets.
