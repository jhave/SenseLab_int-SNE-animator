On Whitehead's account, an occasion  of mapping is not exhaustively traceable to infinite mapping activity,  for it requires a domain or input. Moreover, infinite  mapping activity  is a non-determining predicate, which  means that it does not determine how an occasion  maps  from its domain or given  content. Equally,  how  an occasion  maps  is not exhaustively determined by its domain, for it maps  from that domain as its given content. Nor is how an occasion  maps  exhaustively determined by the structure or rule which  it maps,  for it is the act of mapping of that structure or rule. It follows that the way any occasion  maps  is free or spontaneous relative to infinite  mapping activity,  its domain, and its rule. It is free or spontaneous both in the negative sense that how it maps is not exhaustively traceable to any or all of its conditions, and in the converse, positive sense that it is to this extent irreducibly self-actualizing or self-causing. No occasion  is sole cause of itself, for it derives from infinite  mapping activity  and  a given domain. As Whitehead puts  it, “there is no such fact as absolute freedom” (1978: 133). [16] But every occasion  is a causa sui in respect of how it maps  from its given domain (1978: 222). So it is not universal and infinite  mapping activity  which  is self-actualizing here, but its occasion  as relative to a given domain. There are no ways  of mapping as such, only instances of ways.
