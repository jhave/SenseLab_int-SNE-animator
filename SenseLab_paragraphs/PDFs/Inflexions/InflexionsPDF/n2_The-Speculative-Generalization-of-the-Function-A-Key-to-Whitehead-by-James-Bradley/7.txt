figures  such as Frank  P. Ramsey  in his last writings and Ludvig Wittgenstein after 1929, the position Whitehead develops from around the middle of the 1920's is markedly constructivist in character. [3] The difference resides in the way Whitehead generalizes functional structure, which  he does in two distinguishable senses.
First, Whitehead generalizes the meaning of the function. That is, he seeks the highest or
most general description of the nature of the function in order to provide a meta- functional analysis of the nature and conditions of any function at all. As strictly descriptive (1967a: 92), the analysis is not guilty  of dogmatically assuming, or making an a priori appeal to, the principles of necessary or sufficient reason. Secondly, on the
basis of his general description of the function, Whitehead is able to generalize the range of the function over any entity,  so that his analysis of the function is intended to provide an account of the nature of all that is.
