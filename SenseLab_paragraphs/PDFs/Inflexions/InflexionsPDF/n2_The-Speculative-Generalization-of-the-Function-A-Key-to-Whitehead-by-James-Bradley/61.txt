[13] Whitehead analyzes the notion  of containment in terms  of a direct realist  and singular-causal ontology of 'perception' or information in what  he calls his theory of
'feeling'.  His account of the domain or genealogical conditions of any occasion  means that every  occasion  iterates and inherits or ‘prehends’ (which  is not primarily a matter of consciousness) the entire  previous history of the universe. Thus there  is only one universe for Whitehead (Whitehead, 1978: 4).
