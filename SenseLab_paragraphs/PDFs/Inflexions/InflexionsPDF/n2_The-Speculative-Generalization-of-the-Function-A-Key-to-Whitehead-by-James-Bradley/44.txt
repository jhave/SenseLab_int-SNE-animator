A second central  feature of Whitehead's generalization of the function is that, perhaps for the first time in the history of speculative metaphysics, the concept of the activity  of actualization is not analyzed in terms  of any kind  of emanation, self-differentiation, or divine creation ex nihilo. Whitehead is critical of such notions as basically  nonrelational and  thus  ineffable  (1967b: 130, 169, 236).

That is, it is a complex, dynamic correlation of whole  and  part,  an irreducible “togetherness” (1978: 21-22, 189) which  is given  as such and is neither derivable from concepts nor a
