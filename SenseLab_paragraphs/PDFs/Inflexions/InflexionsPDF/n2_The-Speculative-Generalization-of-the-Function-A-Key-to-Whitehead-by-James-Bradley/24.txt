Considered in itself or in complete abstraction from its instances, the concept of infinite mapping activity  is the concept of a merely  negative infinite  in that it is indeterminate, or lacking  determination of any kind.  As a merely  limitlessly determinable apeiron, it would be characterless, not in the positive, but in the negative sense that it is utterly empty or vacuous, simply a nonentity. However, that would not be activity  at all. For activity  is a relative term: “there is no entity  which  is merely  “any”” (1947: 110), no such thing  as activity  (or power, agency,  or causality) in general, nothing which  in its own right  is a priori. And  what  that means is that there  is infinite  mapping activity  only relative to its instances (1947: 105-6). The concept  of universal mapping activity  is thus
the concept of an infinite  activity  in the sense that it is the concept of an activity  which  is
transcendent relative to any of its instances. That is, universal mapping activity  is the concept, not of a complete, but of a syncategorematic, potential, or relative infinite activity.  To begin to see what  such a notion of the infinite  might  imply,  we need  to consider the second  step in Whitehead's speculative analysis of the function. It will emerge that Whitehead’s analysis of the function does not merely  conform to the definition of the function as the mapping of many-to-one relations, but constitutes a constructivist metaphysical proof  of that definition carried out in the realm  of ontology or the theory of actualization.
