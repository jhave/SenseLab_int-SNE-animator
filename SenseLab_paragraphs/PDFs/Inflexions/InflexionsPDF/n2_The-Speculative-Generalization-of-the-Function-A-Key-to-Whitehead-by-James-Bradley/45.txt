Yet it is an intelligible given or “fact” (1978: 211), for all its elements are thoroughly relational in that they can be defined not only as 'that  from which  another comes' (a quo alius), but also and  necessarily as 'that which  comes from another' (qui ab alio). [19] It would thus  seem that the iterative economy of Whitehead's functional analysis is the proper 'concrete universal', for its unity  is generated through the correlativity and  topic-saturatedness of the parts  that make  it up, and not in virtue of 'containing' or being 'contained in' an underlying, identical substance, often thought of as having all the reasons for its existence  in itself.
