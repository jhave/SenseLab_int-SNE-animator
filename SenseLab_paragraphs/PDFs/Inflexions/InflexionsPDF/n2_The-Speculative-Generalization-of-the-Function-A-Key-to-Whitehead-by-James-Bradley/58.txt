[8] Because it is characterless, Whitehead likens mapping activity  both to Aristotelian matter (except that it is not passive), and  to the neutral stuff or neutral monism of the later William  James and Russell, in that it is not a subject-object relation considered in its own right,  but is the condition of subject-object relations (Whitehead, 1978: 31). Whitehead points out, however, that the many-to-one connectivity of mapping activity means that, unlike  neutral stuff, it is not be conceived as standing in external relations, for it is intrinsically relational. What this means will be spelled out in the course  of this paper.
