Another aspect  of the significance of Whitehead's theory of occasions,  as of Wittgenstein's operation, is that it sidesteps Russell's  Paradox, the paradox of the class of all those classes which  are not members of themselves. For, defined iteratively, no occasion  includes itself; it includes in its arguments only the results of antecedent occasions and  its own results are included only by its successors. In other  words, an occasion  is intrinsically a matter of iterative activity,  so there is in serial analysis no completely realized real to generate reflexive  paradoxes.
