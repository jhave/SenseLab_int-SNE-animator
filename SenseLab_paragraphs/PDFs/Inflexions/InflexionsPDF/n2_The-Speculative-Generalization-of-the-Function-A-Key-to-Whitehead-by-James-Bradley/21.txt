We must  be careful  about  the concept of a 'universal', however. For, secondly, the universal mapping activity  of actualization is a non-determining transcendental condition in a further, radical sense: as the principle of ordination or differentiation, it is prior  to logic and  is a condition of logical order. More precisely: since differentiation is the basic condition of inconsistency, exclusion, or negation, in the concept of universal mapping activity  “the whole  movement of logic is provided for” (1968: 52), since difference, inconsistency, or negation is the fundamental definition of determination of any kind.  In consequence, while mapping activity  is universal, it is not a universal form but a universal activity.  That is, the concept of universal mapping activity  is not to be understood as a unity  of essence  and  existence,  nor of logic and  ontology, for the
activity  of differentiation is the ground or condition of the principle of noncontradiction. It does not follow, however, that the claim to the primordiality of activity  collapses into non-rationality or ineffability. Yet before considering the question
