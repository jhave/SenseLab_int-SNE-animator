In this connection, it would be a mistake to think  that Whitehead's theory of “general potentiality”, as he calls it (1978: 65), is a theory of the real infinite.  [11] For he describes the divine mapping of the realm  of eternal objects as “deficiently actual” (1978: 345), both in the sense that there are other  essential features of the divine nature (as will emerge), and in the sense that the realm  of eternal objects is not self-existent or independent of its finite realizations. On the contrary: not only, in contrast to platonism, is there is no such thing  as general potentiality in its own right, but also, in contrast to Aristotle, eternal objects are not active but wholly passive. This has the effect of completely reversing the notion of participation: the participation of eternal objects in the actual  depends wholly on their finite determinations. Like universal mapping activity,  general potentiality is thus  to be conceived, not as a categorematic, but as a syncategorematic or potential infinity which  “presupposes” (1978: 349; cf. 225, 257), or
is essentially relative to, its finite determinations. It is here that general potentiality
