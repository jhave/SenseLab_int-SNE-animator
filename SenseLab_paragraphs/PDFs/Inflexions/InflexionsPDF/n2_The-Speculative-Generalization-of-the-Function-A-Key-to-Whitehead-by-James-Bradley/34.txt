As iterative, occasions  of mapping are for Whitehead intrinsically serial or ordered in nature. In principle, this means no more than  that any occasion  of mapping stands in a single iterative series of occasions,  and inherits the entire  contents of that series as iterated in each successive occasion.  Yet there are good  reasons, based  on scientific theory (1967a: 121) and  on empirical observation (1967a: 124), for maintaining that as a contingent matter of fact there  are multiple, contemporary or parallel series of occasions. On the multiple series hypothesis, any given  occasion  includes in its domain the iterative series of preceding occasions which  constitute its environment as much  as it includes the iterative series of predecessor occasions in the particular series of mappings in which  it stands. Any occasion  of mapping is thus  intrinsically serial in nature in that it is necessarily a member of a single series of occasions,  which  in fact is one of a multiplicity of series which  constitute its environment. These are the multiple and  intrinsically complex  routes of inheritance of any occasion  of mapping and constitute its genealogical conditions.  In consequence, all occasions necessarily have at
