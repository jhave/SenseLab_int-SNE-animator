Inspired by  Rene  Daalder's  spacecollective.org, the  project  addresses architecture, landscape and urban constraints of extra terrestrial design. While researching NASA's  suburban proposals for space  colonies  of 1970s and  the development of contemporary space  tourism, I was  working on outer atmosphere, gravity and  weightlessness within an architectural design topic. Circular sections  define  the  architectural spatial organization in zero  gravity and  are developed from  a biological  research into  human vertebra as well as historic  architectural precedent Palladio's Villa Rotonda. The combination of soft and  hard elements within the organic structure relate  to bone and  flesh as in the human body.  The design explores new  horizons within built  structures in  outer  space  and  generates enticing spatial qualities and  enigmatic visual
effects in the interior space.
