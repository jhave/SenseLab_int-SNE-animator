Amanda Bagg’s video, In My Language (2007) opens to a woman swaying, her back to the camera. As we watch her hands move, we hear their movement through the sound – a tonal singing – of Amanda’s voice.  What begins as a voice becomes singing hands that roam through the space, creating it in their passing. Flighty, these hands explore the intense movement of a string, shifting from the string to the infinity of textures that populate the room, the voice always in tandem with the becoming-textural of space.   From string to surface to computer bag, the hands play the space. As the hands move, they seem to modulate the voice in a becoming- environmental of sound. Object-voice sonorities are created in tandem with the discovery of the environment’s layers of experiential potential. Accompanying Amanda’s slow dance of feeling, we experience the spacetime of the becoming-environment’s dense affective tone. The shots are long and languid, their slowness rich with the eventfulness of sensation-in-the-making.
