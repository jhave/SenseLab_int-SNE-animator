Propositions oscillate between potential and actualization. “If by the decision of the concrescence, the proposition has been admitted into feeling, then the proposition constitutes what the feeling has felt” (Whitehead 1978: 186). Propositions constitute a “source for the origination of feeling which is not tied down to mere datum” (Whitehead 1978: 186). They are the articulated force of the feeling making its appearance.
