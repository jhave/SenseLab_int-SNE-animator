The will to power is the genealogical element of force. It is a feeling for power, a lure for feeling. “Chance is the bringing of forces into relation, the will to power is the determining principle of this relation” (Deleuze 1993: 53). Collective individuation is another term for this becoming- multiple of relational forces moving toward determination, indeterminately. The will to power values this process, actuating it in a becoming-present.
