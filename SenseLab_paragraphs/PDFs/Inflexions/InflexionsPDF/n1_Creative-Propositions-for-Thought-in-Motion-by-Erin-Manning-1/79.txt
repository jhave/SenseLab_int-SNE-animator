Begin with the terminus. The terminus is not an end-point but the energy of a beginning. The terminus kick-starts the process. There is no causal finitude here: we never know what becomes of a beginning. The directionality we have ‘in mind’ is a relation of tension, a movement-toward that makes us think, always more than a goal. The terminus forces thought toward articulation.
