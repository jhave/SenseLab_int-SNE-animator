Rhythm is prearticulated feeling in motion. Feeling in motion is thought pre-articulated. Editing with these virtual tendencies already immanent to the images taking form culls thought from within the work’s own process, articulating it as movement-images, time-images. These images do not simply represent the movement of the image; they move images, intensifying the felt aspect of spacetime. They articulate the film’s movement. The plane of composition through which articulation emerges is populated by the thought of the work, its inner rhythm.  Deleuze and Guattari call this inner rhythm a “block of sensation.” “We paint, sculpt, compose, and write with sensations” (1994: 166). Blocks of sensation are forces that compose the work’s durational attitude. To edit-with is to sculpt the work’s taking-form, to capture the imminent networks of forces which make up the becoming-work. “By means of the material, the aim of art is […] to extract a block of sensations, a pure being of sensation” (1994: 167). What is composed is more than the work’s actual articulation. Editing-with composes with the work’s pre-articulated virtuality. It layers the articulated strata of the work, directing the work’s force such that its
