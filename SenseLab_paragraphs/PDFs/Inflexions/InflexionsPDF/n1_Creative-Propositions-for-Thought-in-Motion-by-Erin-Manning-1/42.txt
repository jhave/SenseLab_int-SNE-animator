It is not the subject that is inventive, but the process itself. A feeling does not belong to me – it moves through me, creating me in the process. The form-taking of the work is the work’s becoming-fulfilled as such. This is the work’s moment of full appearance in the actual world. As the work reaches this apex, it feels the world forming the afterthought of a subject. This afterthought of a subject is what Whitehead calls a superject.
