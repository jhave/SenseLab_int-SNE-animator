It takes time to perceive the line’s necessity. Perception operates as the force of the line’s will. Robert Irwin wants to know how perception shifts the  experiment,  so  he  sits,  watches,  falls asleep, attends, tweaks, focuses, alternating between phases of attention and boredom. Transvaluation involves working with the process’s enabling constraints, asking what the process can do in light of what it has already done and what it never thought it could do. After sitting for hours, perceiving two lines on a uniform canvas, Irwin was shocked: “Two lines changed not only the composition but even the colour” (Irwin in Weschler 1982: 72).
