One work can have many dynamic forms, many concepts, many feelings or thoughts. There is no single point of identity for a work. The only time the work stops working is when you make yourself the subject of the work. The work’s subject is its dynamic form, its valuation, its conceptual resonance, its diagram. Don’t make subjectivity the subject of creation!  Holding to the subject as creative motor stabilizes the forces of becoming.   Be careful, says Nietzsche: curtailing the process of becoming invites reactive force. Reactivity wills the framing of the self as subject, holding the work to its own self-image, to a simulacrum of what it already was. The result: the work never invents beyond the subject’s own process of self-completion.
