For Tarkovsky, editing is immanent to the flow of audio-images which make up the film as captured on camera. Editing is not something you impose onto the work: it is a pulling out or prehension of the rhythms already virtually present in the work. Editing foregrounds the backgrounded rhythm of the work.
