Amanda   Baggs   articulates   felt   thought.   To   articulate   thinking-feeling   is   to   activate   the conceptual at work in the prearticulation of the experiential. To bring concepts to life rather than simply the contours of things is the first step in expressing the force of a relational environment. Bringing potential relations into actual experience is, as Baggs notes, “a way of thinking in its own right.” Thought is more-than a form-taking of words, it is also an incipience that proposes articulation through sensation. Thought is a proposition for feeling-in-motion. Thought is experience’s complex instigator, a force that operates at the relational cusp of becoming-events.
