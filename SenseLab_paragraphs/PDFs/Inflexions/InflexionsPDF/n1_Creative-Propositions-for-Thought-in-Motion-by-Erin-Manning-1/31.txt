Valuation is an orientation that makes the work matter in certain definite ways.  How the event is integrated onto the nexus is determined by its valuation. Valuation is integral to the process of an actual occasion taking form, but is felt as such only in the eventâ€™s final satisfaction. With this satisfaction comes an inclination toward determinate expression. The process of valuation self- selects tendencially, leading the event toward certain areas of potential on the work-world nexus. Each valuation thus adds a singular resonance to the nexus and becomes a potential for other actual occasions. A valuation inflects novelty into the world.
