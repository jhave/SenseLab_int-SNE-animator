Ask of the creative process that it foreground the activity of creating concepts, that it will these concepts out of the matter-form itself, that it mould the activity of process into a becoming-body of  invention.  Ask  of  the  process  that  it  value  its  own  becoming,  that  it  open  thought  and sensation beyond the actuality of what the work appears to be. Provoke sensing bodies in movement, will the forces of transmutation such that a new body (of work) emerges!
