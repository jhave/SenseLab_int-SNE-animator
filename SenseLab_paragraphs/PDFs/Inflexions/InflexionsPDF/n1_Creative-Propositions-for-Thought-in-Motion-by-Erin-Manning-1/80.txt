“Whatever terminates that chain was, because it now proves itself to be, what the concept ‘had in mind’” (James 1912: 58). The terminus is not what you think you knew. It’s the movement of thought pulled forth from the relations of tension that make up the work. The work values the terminus as an in-gathering of potential for form-taking. Through the terminus as a force of its activity on the world-work nexus, the work propels itself toward a directionality, which is never where you thought it would be.
