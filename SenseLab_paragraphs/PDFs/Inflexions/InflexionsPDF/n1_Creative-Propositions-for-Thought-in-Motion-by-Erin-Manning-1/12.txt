For Amanda Baggs, creating relational nexuses means feeling the world at the incipience of its sensory becoming. This feeling is a form of thought. Articulation of that thought implies restricting the complexity of the thought’s prearticulation to a content-based structure of expression. She resists this simplification, opting not against language, but for relational complexity. Baggs’ explains: “Far from being purposeless, the way that I move is an ongoing response to what is around me. Ironically, the way that I move when responding to everything around me is described as ‘being in a world of my own,’ whereas if I interact with a much more limited set of responses and only react to a much more limited part of my surroundings people claim that I am ‘opening up to true interaction with the world.’”
