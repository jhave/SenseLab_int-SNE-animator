“Returning is the being of that which becomes” (Nietzsche in Deleuze 1993: 48). Attention feels the return of the return. It produces a germ for thought. Focus is of a different order. Focus propels articulation. Attending to the interval between focus and attention means inviting thought’s virtual potential into the articulation of a concept. We attend, always, to the relation, distracted by it, and drawn to it. Attentive, we feel the forces of composition; focused, we pull them together. Attention backgrounds what focus can do.
