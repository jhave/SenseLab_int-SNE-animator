Nietzsche implores, “Value! Don’t evaluate!”  He situates value as a differential vector in the process of creation. Do not stray too far outside the work, he warns. Do not wait for evaluation to value the work. Feel the work’s impulse--dance its becoming-form! Remember that the will to power is force acting on force! Think value as a mechanism for the extrusion of the qualities of force throughout the process of force taking form.
