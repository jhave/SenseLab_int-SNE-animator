Speculation moves thought toward the activity of concept formation. It values this process, working from the textures of the work-world relation rather than from the distinctness of the object as such. “Knowledge of sensible realities…comes to life inside the tissue of experience. “It is made; and made by relations that unroll themselves in time” (James 1912: 57). Speculation is a technique for the invention of new textures of knowledge.
