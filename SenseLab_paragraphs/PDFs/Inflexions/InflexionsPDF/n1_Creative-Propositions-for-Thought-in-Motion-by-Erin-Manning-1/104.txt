Difference and forgetting are co-constitutive. To feel differently, the form of the experience has to shift. The experience has to forget what it was. New forces result in new compositions, and new compositions call forth new articulations. “Every relationship of forces constitutes a body… This is why the body is always the fruit of chance” (Deleuze 1993: 40).
