A proposition is never a judgment. Nor is it necessarily true. It is a terminus-in-action. Focusing appetition on the transitional relation that makes the thought felt, a proposition cuts through the event, shifting the ground. For Lygia Clark, a proposition is the capacity for a potential to take relational form. “Nothing, in Clark’s propositions, was ever reducible to a concrete body, empirical or organic” (Rolnik 2005: 9). Propositions move the concept into action. But this movement is always on the cusp, and that’s how it alters the ground. “What I know now is that the body is more than the body,” writes Clark.
