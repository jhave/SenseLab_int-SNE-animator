Without transduction, propositions have no force. Transduction is the unity of an event across its different phases, the processual sense of individuation across strata. Transduction creates affinities  between  levels  of  experience.  A  work  becomes  multiple  as  it  changes  not  only  its matter-form, but the quality of its process. Propositions provoke transductions. Not every relational object is evocative in every instance. New moulds are necessary, but also new forms of matter, and each material shape shifts into different affinities of purpose. “Dynamic osmosis” Lygia Clark would say.
