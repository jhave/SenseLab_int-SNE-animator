The will to power makes force felt. Felt force is a concept-in-waiting. There is no subject to the will to power, no outside criteria that forces. Force propulses a will toward the creation of a dynamic form, opening feeling to its activation, generating becoming-bodies in its passing. A society  emerges.  For  Whitehead  all  bodies  are  societies,  conglomerations  of  forces  and potentials and tendencies.
