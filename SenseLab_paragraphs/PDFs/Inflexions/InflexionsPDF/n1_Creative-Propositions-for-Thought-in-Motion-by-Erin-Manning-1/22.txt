“Parts come together because of a propensity inherent in the material” (Tarkovsky 1987: 117). Sculpting in time is not placing parts together to make a whole. This would suggest a process of construction where the parts would pre-exist the whole. The whole is the film’s virtual strata, its durational attitude.  Sculpting in time pulls intensities from this durational process, creating resonant sculptures of spacetime. “The novel entity is at once the togetherness of the ‘many’ which it finds, and also it is one among the disjunctive ‘many’ which it leaves. The many become one, and are increased by one” (Whitehead 1978: 21).  Editing from within involves composing with the work’s own process of taking-form, finalizing the cut in time with its virtual potential through time. At best, what is actually seen is felt as more-than. In such cases, the film becomes a complex surface of prearticulation. Editing from within gives virtual resonance to the images, foregrounding their incipience within the becoming-whole of the film.
