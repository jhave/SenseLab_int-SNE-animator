Lygia Clark’s relational objects create worlds: this is how their value is felt. These objects – plastic bags filled with breath, nets with stones in them – are of little artistic value in and of themselves. The value of Lygia Clark’s relational objects is not expressed in their capacity to stand alone. It is felt in the emergent qualities that their coupling with bodies- in-relation brings forth. Their value lies in how the forces of potential express themselves through relational movement toward the world. Their value cannot be detached from the process’s enabling constraints. Their value is how the process determines its potential for taking-form.
