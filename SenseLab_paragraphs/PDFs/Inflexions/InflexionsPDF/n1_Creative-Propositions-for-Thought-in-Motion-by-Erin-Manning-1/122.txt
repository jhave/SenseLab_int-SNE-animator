Thought is a force to contend with. Thought moves (with) the work, feeling the openings the work provokes. Going to the limit is its mantra, and this is hard work. The work not only speaks for itself, but it speaks “you,” sparking individuation in its process of becoming. Co-creation takes time, and it makes time, creating new and even more complex forces in its passing. There is no   easy   solution   to   the   concrescence   of   the   work,   no   pat   ideology   or   theory,   just experimentation.
