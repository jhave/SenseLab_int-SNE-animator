Radical empiricism is a speculative engagement with process that takes relation as its field of enquiry. The relation emerges differently in different contexts. Relations are conjunctive, disjunctive, the point where everything begins to fall apart and the incipience field of individuation. Moving the relation is to move with the force of incipient form.  Speculation is the process that transforms incipient individuation into movements of thought.
