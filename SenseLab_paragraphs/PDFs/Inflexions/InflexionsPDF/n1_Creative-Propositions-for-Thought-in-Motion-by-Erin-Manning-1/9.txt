Throughout Part II, as Amanda Baggs attempts to place language within her complex multisensory  environment,  she  continues  to  create  relational  encounters  that  render  the linguistic space more intricate than words could simply connote. She speaks, but she also rocks, smells, touches, tastes, observes, feeling the environment. There is something about Bagg’s experience that we’ll never know, because to know it is to feel it. Communication through language will always fall short. Yet language is able to convey a certain complexity of the concepts at work, bridging the worlds such that a dialogue between worlds-in-the-making can begin. In “My Translation” what Amanda Baggs does is begin to teach us how to articulate felt thought.
