Think the diagram as a territory beyond representation. Representation solidifies the imaginary of preexistent worlds and asks the work to fit within their borders.  Diagrams resist borders, activating tendencies of becoming-form and incipient-figure. The force of the work is felt in its diagram. Think the diagram as a landing site you cannot quite define, a site you feel more than you see, a focal point through which the work organises itself in a refrain of infinite unfolding. Diagrams create intensive networks that make the work resonate.
