Rigour is key. But not rigour as a practice situated at the outskirts of the creative process. Pay rigorous attention to the plane of becoming where feeling moves thought. Donâ€™t be too quick to judge. Value the process as it takes form, and find the force of form in the transmutation of world-work.
