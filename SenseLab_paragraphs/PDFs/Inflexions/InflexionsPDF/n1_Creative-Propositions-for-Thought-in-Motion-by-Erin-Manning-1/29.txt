Diagrams foreground the work’s elastic points, its tendencies. They invent with the future of the work’s becoming. Diagrams make the elasticity of the almost felt, exfoliating the work’s potential across its shifting surface. Diagrams move the work, inviting the conceptual escape of “the action of invisible forces on the body” (Deleuze 2003:36). Diagrams rhythmically call forth the relation artwork-world.
