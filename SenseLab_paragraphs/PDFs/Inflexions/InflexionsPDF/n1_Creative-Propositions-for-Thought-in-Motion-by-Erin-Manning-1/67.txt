What appears, for Whitehead, is what is pulled forth from the nexus. To create is to work with appearance such that appearance affirms not only its actuality, but its virtual potential.   For all appearance is more than what it seems, and yet really only what it is. This means that what is created must at once be real and an aspect of the real. This paradoxical schism between reality and appearance can be understood as the difference between what we actually perceive, and what populates our perception virtually. Reality is all which has existed, which has been felt. Appearance is what is felt in the conjunction of the future-present as it is imbued with pastness but devoid of it in actuality. To feel the real within the actual is to work with the forces of the real within appearance. It is to affirm these forces in the double-gesture of working in the future-past. To sense is to feel more than the actual sense, to multiple-sense the pastness of the not-yet that has been. The stimulation of the actual by the virtual creates tendencies toward incipient novelty that can be felt in the work. These are silent concepts active in the becoming-affective of the piece. To create a work that emerges as a complex whole requires an aliveness of this virtuality within the workâ€™s actual appearance.
