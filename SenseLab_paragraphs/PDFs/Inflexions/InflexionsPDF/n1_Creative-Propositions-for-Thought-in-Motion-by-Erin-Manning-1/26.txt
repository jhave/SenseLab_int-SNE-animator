Forces direct the composition of the work. In painting, Bacon refers to patterns of force as diagrams. Diagrams cannot be defined as such; they are felt only in their effects. They virtually resonate within actualised work. Diagrams recompose sensation, collecting the intensity of rhythm and propelling it toward a becoming-work of the work. Bacon speaks of diagrams as “orders of sensation,” “levels of feeling,” “areas of sensation,” “shifting sequences” each of them conceived as different orders of a singular block of sensation. Deleuze and Guattari call these blocks “refrains,” internally ordered shifting rhythms that force worlds into appearance. The refrain is rhythm and melody actively recomposing into a territoriality that becomes a work, a gesticulation, an iteration. It is territorial because it is expressive of a singular spacetime, yet metastable, expressive always in a dance of modulation.
