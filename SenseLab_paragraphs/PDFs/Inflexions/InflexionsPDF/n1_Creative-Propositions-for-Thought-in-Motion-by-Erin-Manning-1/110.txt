Nothing happens on a pure continuum. Process in and for itself goes nowhere. Chance cuts the continuum into forces of necessity. This cut is a transvaluation of the work-world nexus. New processes are inflected with new differentials, new stakes, “the more you limit yourself, the more fertile you become in invention” (Irwin in Weschler 1982: 69). Think necessity as the constraining force on the plane of becoming.
