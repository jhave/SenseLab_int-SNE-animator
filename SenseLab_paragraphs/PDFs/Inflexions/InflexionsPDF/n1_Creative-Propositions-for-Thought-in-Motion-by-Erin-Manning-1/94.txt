Propositions are a lure for feeling. By propulsing the event toward what it can do, propositions effect the concrescence of an actual occasion. They make the work work differently. They work from the workâ€™s differential. Assembling effects of relation across the nexus of actual occasions, propositions act as the pulling together of the stakes of research-creation. To create, in these terms, involves constituting what the feeling has felt. This is not just the case in the process of making art. Philosophy is creative whenever it writes not from the perspective of a subject- writing, but from the vantage point of a feeling creating. A feeling is never personal; it is a movement of thought, a quality of relation becoming-active, a force of will.
