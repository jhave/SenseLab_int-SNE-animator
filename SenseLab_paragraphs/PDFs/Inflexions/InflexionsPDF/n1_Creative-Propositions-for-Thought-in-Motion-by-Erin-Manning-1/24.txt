duration within the film’s experiential whole.   It seeks to create spacetime, not simply reproduce it. “Rhythm is determined not by the length of the edited pieces, but by the pressure of the time that runs through them” (Tarkovsky 1987: 117). Editing from within is rhythmic editing that foregrounds the time-pressure inherent in the composition. Time-pressure is a block of sensation, the force of a transformation that brings the material stratum’s virtual potential to life.
