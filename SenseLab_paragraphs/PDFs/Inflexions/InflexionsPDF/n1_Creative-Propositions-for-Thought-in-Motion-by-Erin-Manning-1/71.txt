For Nietzsche, chance functions as the differential. Chance beckons necessity, “necessity is affirmed of chance in exactly the sense that being is affirmed of becoming and unity is affirmed of multiplicity” (Deleuze 1993: 26). Necessity propels the singular taking-form of the work, separating the work at hand from its infinite potentiality. “To know how to affirm chance is to know how to play” (Nietzsche in Deleuze 1993: 26).
