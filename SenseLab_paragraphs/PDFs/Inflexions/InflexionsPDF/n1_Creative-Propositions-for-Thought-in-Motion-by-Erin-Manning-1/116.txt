“When I look at the world now, my posture is not one of focus, but of attention” (Irwin in Weschler 1982: 81). Attend to the return: “That the present moment is not a moment of being or of present ‘in the strict sense’, that it is the passing moment, forces us to think of becoming, but to think of it precisely as what could not have started, and cannot finish, becoming” (Deleuze
1993: 48). Attention is short-lived – a half-second at most. It tends to be flighty, indeterminate.
