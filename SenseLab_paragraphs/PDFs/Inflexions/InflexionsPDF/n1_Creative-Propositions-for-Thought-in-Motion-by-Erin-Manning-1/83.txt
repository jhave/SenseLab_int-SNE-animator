Moving the relation is the work of radical empiricism. Begin with the interval and admit it into experience. Rethink what counts as art, as practice, as thought, as writing, as politics. The relation is as real as anything else – it is the associated milieu through which all else comes into contact. Relation is the incipient activating force through which the work-world nexus emerges.
