Editing from within sculpts the film’s becoming in time. Tarkovsky writes: “Editing brings together shots which are already filled with time, and organizes the unified, living structure inherent in the film, and the time that pulsates through the blood vessels of the film, making it alive, is of varying rhythmic pressure” (1987: 114). Sculpting time means creating time from within the work’s own composition.
