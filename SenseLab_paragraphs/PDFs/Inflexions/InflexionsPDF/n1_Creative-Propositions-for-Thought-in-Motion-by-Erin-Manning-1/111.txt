Robert Irwin writes: “Just changing the line that one eighth of an inch changed the entire perceptual field” (Irwin in Weschler 1982:71). Transvaluation alters the field. Sitting in front of his canvas, Irwin watches as the painted line transduces his painting into the perception of a concept. The line becomes the transvaluation that opens his work to future thought.
