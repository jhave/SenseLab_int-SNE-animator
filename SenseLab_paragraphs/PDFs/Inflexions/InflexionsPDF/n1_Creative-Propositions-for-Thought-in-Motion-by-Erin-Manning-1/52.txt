To feel power is to feel force, to be captivated by force and to capture that captivation. Will to power feels inner dynamism and moves it into actualization through a concrescence that makes new parameters for thought felt. It is only after the fact that the active necessity of the feeling’s plane of composition – the superject – takes form. This taking form is less the formation of a concrete identity than the culmination and residue of a process. To posit a subject for the feeling means engaging with the creative from outside. This is an evaluative strategy, a reactive interruption of the process. Reactivity dulls force, stalling its potential for transformation.
