The concept is a gear-shift mechanism that acts on blocks of sensation, oscillating between thought and articulation. It pulsates between actual and virtual realms. On the virtual strata, they propel the becoming-event of thought: they feel its force. On the plane of composition, concepts articulate the dynamic form of the becoming-work: they express the feeling of its force. Thought is immanent to the work even as the work itself is immanent to the forces through which its concept concresces.
