Spinoza says we know not what a body can do. Feeling creates rhythmic or vibratile bodies. To feel is to vibrate thought. Feeling incites concrescence. It wills the activity of becoming. Feeling is power’s “compulsion of composition” (Whitehead 1978: 119). This compulsion to compose is an aesthetic drive, a will toward sensation, a will to power. The will to power is not about individual power. The will to power activates the potential of a force to move a body to its limit. Power is a lure for feeling. Before Nietzsche called it the “will to power,” he called it the “feeling of power.”
