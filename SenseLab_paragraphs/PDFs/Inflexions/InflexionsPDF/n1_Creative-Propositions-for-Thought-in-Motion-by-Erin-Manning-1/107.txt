“Being composed of a plurality of irreducible forces, the body is a multiple phenomenon” (Deleuze 1993: 40). Active and reactive forces fight for dominion in the becoming-body. A body of work feels this fight and responds to it through submission, invention, experimentation, categorization. This is a fight between passivity and activity. The imposition of a pre-constituted theory onto a work threatens to make it passive. Evaluated from the outside, the risk is that the work will suffocate, dead to what it could still have become.
