Thought is the capacity to be affected. To be affected is to go to the limit of what a thought can do. “The philosopher creates concepts that are neither eternal nor historical but untimely and not of the present […] untimely at every epoch” (Deleuze 1993: 107). Thoughts are activities of relation that take time even as they make time, animated in the process of invention that is the activity of living.
