“It is not the being that returns but rather the returning itself that constitutes being insofar as it is  affirmed  of  becoming  and  of  that  which  passes”  (Deleuze  1993:  48).  The  return  is  a becoming-spiral. Thinking is always of the return. Attentive, you are never quite thinking the thought you thought you were. The flicker moves faster than thought’s actualization. And yet the thought is virtually there, to be thought again, differently.
