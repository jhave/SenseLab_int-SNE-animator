Thought is of the relation, active in the movement-toward of the work’s taking-form. The work’s taking-form is the pulling-out of a concept from the activity of feeling that propels the work. Lodged neither in the human nor in the object, thought propels creativity as the activity of the in- between that makes relation felt, activating the “how” of the creation, inciting inquiry, curiosity, play.
