Propositions never attend solely to the datum. If you restrict them to a preformed body, a stand- alone object, they become judgments or evaluations. Don’t think you already know what a body can do. Lygia Clark’s propositions do not tell us what the object can do. They create enabling constraints for the opening of a relational process. Placing her objects in specific iterations of the world-world nexus – iterations called forth by the relations themselves – Clark asks the body- becoming to emerge differently each time. Clark does not make herself the subject of the work, she asks the relation to make itself felt. Her relational objects are propositions, constitutively incapable of knowing in advance what they can produce.
