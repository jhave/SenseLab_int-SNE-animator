The differential cuts into experience, exposing it to its potential. As a vector of transformation, the differential forces the work into the now-ness of its actualization. The production of the now is the necessity – what Nietzsche calls destiny – of the event that is the work in progress. For the event to take place, unity must be actualized. Yet this unity must also expose the virtual effects out of which appearance is composed. The eventness of a work stimulated by a differential cut is the oneness of its infinite multiplicity. The differential never produces wholes. It creates singularities that are always both one and many.
