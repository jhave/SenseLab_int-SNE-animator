Becoming-bodies feel-with the world.   Feeling-with is not without thought. It is a force of thought. Donâ€™t mistake feeling with emotion. Emotion is the description of an affect, feeling is its force. Affective tone is an environmental resonance of a feeling-in-action, a vibratile force that makes the milieu felt. Feeling is a pulsion to think, and thinking is a pulsion to feel. Thought feels the prospect for concepts within processes that becomes work. Feeling is a rigorous sensitivity that situates thought in the world: thought becomes affective. Affect bleeds into the work; it bleeds the work, activating its complexities. The work becomes a thinking-feeling. Working at the threshold of thought and creation provokes an aperture for that which has not been thought. Thought is a lure for feeling that pre-articulates the virtual inflexions of a becoming-work.
