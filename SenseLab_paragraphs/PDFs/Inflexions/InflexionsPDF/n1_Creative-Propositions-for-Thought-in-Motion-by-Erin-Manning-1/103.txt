Eternal return is both movement and cycle of time. Don’t be seduced into thinking time is linear. Time  is  the  future  past,  the  nonsensuous  –  the  feeling  of  the  past  –  overlapping  with  the sensuous – the feeling of the present.  Force activity into the past and you will feel nothing new. This is what Nietzsche calls ressentiment: the embedding of reactive forces in the will to power.
