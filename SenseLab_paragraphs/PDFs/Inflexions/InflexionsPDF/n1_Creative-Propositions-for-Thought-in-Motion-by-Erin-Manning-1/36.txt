Value is a feeling-with, a force for articulation, the potential for degrees of difference. For Nietzsche “evaluations […] are not values but ways of being, modes of existence of those who judge and evaluate, serving as principles for the values on the basis of which they judge” (in Deleuze 1983: 1). To value is to make relational potential the subject of enquiry, rather than evaluating a stand-alone object as separate from the work-world nexus.  A work’s value depends on how it moves the relation.
