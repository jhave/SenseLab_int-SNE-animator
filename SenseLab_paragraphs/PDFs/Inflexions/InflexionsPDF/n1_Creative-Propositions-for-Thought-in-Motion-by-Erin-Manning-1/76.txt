Radical empiricism asks the whatness of the work to emerge relationally. “And this whatness is empirical ‘content’, just as the whatness of separation and discontinuity is real content in the contrasted case” (James 1912: 49). Radical empiricism begins in the middle (le milieu), creating an environment for experimentation.
