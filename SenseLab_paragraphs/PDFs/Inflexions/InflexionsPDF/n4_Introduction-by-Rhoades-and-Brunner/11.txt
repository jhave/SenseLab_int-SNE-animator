One cannot address Guattari’s concept of transversality without considering the notion of subjectivity in his work.   Subjectivity is different from the notion of the subject.  Subjectivity for Guattari always denotes a process, something that  shifts and  oscillates  between entanglements of existential territories and  universes of value.   On the one hand, existential territories are hooks  onto actual  experiences, they  stand out  in  their  singularity.   They  are  remarkable points. On  the  other hand, universes of value  are  “non-dimensioned, non-coordinate, trans-sensible and  infinite” (Guattari 2008: 85 n.15). For Guattari the production of subjectivity is based  on transversal practices that  allow  the collective  emergence and entanglement of existential territories and  universes of value.  Transversality as a field  of expression provides the  milieu for a creative emergence from  disparate forces.   As a “dimension to overcome two impasses,” it is not a mere  connecting device  but a practice for novelty to emerge. The novelty that transversal practices yield  always feed from  existential territories and  universes of value.   We have  to stress  this  transversal mode  of productivity to avoid  any  alignment with  mere connectivist  or  communicational  models  of  different  terms   that   are   merely linked.  Transversality never  links.   It crafts,  shifts  and  relates.    Inflexions, as a platform, does  not just connect  or gather, which  would denote a non-transversal mode  of production, but it becomes  a field for transversal expression.
