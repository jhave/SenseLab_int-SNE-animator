Inflexions as an online  journal emerges as a transversalizing field interweaving content and  expression to arrive  at an aesthetics that  allows  no straightforward order and  categorical closure.   In that  sense  the  issue’s interface itself  has  to be regarded  as  a  transversal field  of  experience  that   includes the  potential for excess.   In this regard, the issue is attuned to William  James’ concept of the “moreness” of an experience, a moreness that  we tried  to make  palpable through the  digital potential for  simultaneous modulations of intensive and  expressive flows  activated through a continual doubling between interfacing and  reading, listening and  viewing.  “Our  fields  of experience…are fringed forever  by a more that   continuously  develops,  and   that   continuously  supersedes  them   as  life proceeds” (James  2003: 37; original emphasis).  This  moreness of experience in the  mode   of  transversality pulls   us  into  divergent  experiences even  while   it leaves traces behind that virtualize into a collective  field of potentiality.
