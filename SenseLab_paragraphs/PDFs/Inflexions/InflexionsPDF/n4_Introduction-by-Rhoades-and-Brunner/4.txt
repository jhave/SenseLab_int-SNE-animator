Right now  zigzags are activating.  They may not be at the forefront of the actions and   events   taking   place  at  this  moment but  they  are  occurring.   Zigzags, a transversality of sound and  colour  in Sher Doruff’s “ZeNeZ and  the RE[a]DShift BOOM!”,  open  this  fourth issue  of Inflexions by  activating several  movements that  emerge from  the  middle, the  space  of the  in-between.  As an expression of the  zigzags found in her  graphical essay,  Doruff’s title derives from  a comment that   Gilles  Deleuze  made   in  the  final  interview  with   Claire   Parnet  for  the program L'Abécédaire de Gilles Deleuze (1994), where upon reaching the letter  Z he muses  that  “he  sees  Zen  as the  reverse of Nez  (nose),  which  is also  a zigzag” (Stivale  2008: 20).  We can see both  the words “Zen”  and  “Nez” in Doruff’s title but  she  changes Deleuze’s palindrome by altering the  simple  zigzag  reading of the word.  By situating the letter  “N”  so that  it overlaps in both  words, Doruff’s new  compound word produces a zigzag,  or transversal, movement that  emerges in its reading. The “N” shifts from one word to the other  as it is read  overcoming the  need  to  read  the  word both  forwards and  backwards but  still  leaving the
potential for a palindromic reading.
