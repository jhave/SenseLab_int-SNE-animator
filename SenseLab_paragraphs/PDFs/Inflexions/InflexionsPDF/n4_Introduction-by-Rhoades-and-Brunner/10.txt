moving-with the  forces  we  encounter in  contemporary transversal fields  that shape our  everyday experiences.  The fields  that  open  up  in this  issue  resonate with   different  encounters  between  the   human  and   the   “more-than-human” through registers of cinema  (Bordeleau and  Thain),  dance  (Dolphijn and Kurikka/Sihvonen), sound and  colour  (Doruff),  computer icons  (Evans), synaesthetic experiences (Munster), digital video  (Payne),  and  jazz (Rosenberg). We regard these  contributions as remarkable points in a complex and  open  field of aesthetic experiences in resonance with  Guattari’s ecosophic critique of non- transversal  modes  of   production  as   opposed  to   different   productions  of subjectivity.
