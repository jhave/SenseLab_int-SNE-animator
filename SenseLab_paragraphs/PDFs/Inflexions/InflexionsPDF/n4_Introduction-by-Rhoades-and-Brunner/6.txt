Like Doruff’s compound word, the title of this issue, “Transversal Fields of Experience,” activates its own  transversal movement that  emerges in its reading. Upon  first  reading the  title,  it may  be understood to say  “Transversal Fields of Experience.”   But a second reading of the  title  is possible and  offers  a different proposition.  By placing the emphasis in the first part  of the title, it can be read  as “Transversal  Fields of  Experience.”    Because   the   word  “Fields”, functioning similarly to  Doruff’s  “N”,  overlaps between the  two  different readings of the title,  a  zigzag   movement occurs.    This  zigzag   emerges through  the  repeated reading of the title.  This is to say a transversal shift arises in the title that enables the  potential for  different readings  to  emerge and   takes  these  readings in  a number of different directions.
