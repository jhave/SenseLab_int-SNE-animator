The  transversal shifts  found in  Doruffâ€™s  word and   throughout her  graphical essay,  both  visually and  conceptually, as well  as those  that  appear in the title of this issue  of Inflexions, are just brief examples of the shifting experiences that  are proposed throughout this  issue.   Like the  zigzag,  the  works  in this  issue  never follow  one particular direction and  never  remain at one particular point  for very long.    But  at  the  same  time,  when there  are  points that  connect  between the various disciplines, concepts and  fields  of practice, new  directions take  off that open  up a field of potential for different experiences to emerge.
