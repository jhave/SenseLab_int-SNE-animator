Transversal fields  of experience provide a way  for different pragmatic and speculative encounters through the exploration of, and  the play  with,  platforms. The “N”  of Doruff’s palindrome generates a zigzag  that  becomes  expressive in the  form  of a creature of the  middle.  Platforms such  as Inflexions engage us in “effective  practices of  experimentation” on  all  transversal levels  across  social, mental and  subjective  ecologies  (Guattari 2008: 24).   Experience always moves from  the  middle and   expands in  a  continuous flux  between  expression and content.   In  this  flux,  the  relations between ecological  registers in  all  of  their actual   and   virtual  singularities are  key.    This,  in  turn,   creates   a  speculative pragmatism; a speculativeness that underlines the radical openness for experimentation that  cannot but  be felt in its different expressions through the reading/viewing/listening.   Convergence  and   divergence  across   transversal fields and creative platforms is sensed more than  it is known as such.
