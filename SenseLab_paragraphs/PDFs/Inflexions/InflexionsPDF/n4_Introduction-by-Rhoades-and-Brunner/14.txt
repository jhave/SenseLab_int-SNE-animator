The   contributions  to   this   issue   address  these   emerging  zigzags  between expression and  content, as  well  as  the  ethico-political engagement  that  arises through the  relations between the  human and  more-than human in such  fields. But  rather than  providing entries and  exits  into  different transversal fields  of experience,  the  issue  itself  and   its  potential as  an  online   journal  becomes   a transversal field  of experience.  What  is at stake  is the  actual  expressiveness of the   journal’s  format  in  its  multifaceted  variations  and   modulations,  which contribute actively  to the  extension of expression into  the  world of experience. We see this  occurring through an  interfacing of experience, which  creates  new ways  of accessing  the  work.    This  in turn  produces new  modalities of reading that  are introduced through the very technicities of presentation, thus  producing a  doubling  of  complex  layers   of  experience,  multiplied  by   the   interface’s potential  for  expression.    This  issue   deals   with   different  media  formats  as experiences for a transversality of reading/listening/viewing that is meant to generate fields  of relational experience through the  modes of expression of the interface itself.
