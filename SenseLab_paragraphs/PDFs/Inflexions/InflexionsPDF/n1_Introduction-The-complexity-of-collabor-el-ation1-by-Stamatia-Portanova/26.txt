As a philosopher-mathematician, Whitehead could  not but express  the collaborative creative process  leading to the formation of experiential nexus  as a mathematical function, thus  accomplishing an important fusion  of speculative and analytical philosophy, and reinterpreting the nature of mathematics not only on the basis of its logical rigor but also in relation to its ‘applicability’ to the infinity of the world. Highlighting the importance of this speculative re- combination in both ontological and scientific fields, James Bradley  discusses Whitehead’s understanding of creative process as the fundamental activity leading, through the reciprocal relations of different prehensions, to the constitution of an
‘apparent’ order of occasions.  In the Whiteheadian terminology, appearance is
not to be considered as a category differing from the real, but as a subtractive mode  of becoming, a sensible  actualisation through which  the reality  of the past participates in the creation of a new presence. The Whiteheadian philosophical definition of creativity is that of ‘a relation between the many  and  the one’, a one which  is ‘many’ pasts  and futures, a many  which  becomes,  or tries to become
‘one’ present. This definition is re-folded into a logical correspondence with  the
mathematical function, which  becomes  like the matrix  or the schema  of the relation: mathematical generalisation working as the diagrammatic sign of a metaphysical generalisation.
