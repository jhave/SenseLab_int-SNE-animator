At this point,  two clarifications seem necessary. First of all, far from claiming any solipsistic affirmation of an autonomous phenomenological self, the insistence on the ‘already collaborative’ nature of the individual aims at underlining the significance of the relation and the parts  as co-constituent elements of one and  the same self: in other  words, one ‘part’ of the world (or one subjective self) as always already emerging from a relation of conjuncted, internal and  external parts. Secondly, the parallel ‘risk’ of extreme atomism implied by a radical philosophy of parts  evaporates through the conceptualisation of an equal  ontological importance shared by both aspects:  because “Radical  empiricism (...) is fair to both the unity  and  the disconnection. It finds no reason  for treating either  as illusory.” The particular “explanatory stress”  posed by James on the crucial role of the parts is strategically deployed against rationalist or idealist philosophies where universal, transcendental wholes pre-exist and pre-determine the parts
(for example when the undifferentiated and  chaotic continuity of relations too
easily takes up the role of an all-encompassing universal). Rather  than  dissolving into the whole  which  they co-constitute, and  rather than  being erased by the continuous relations in which  they are implicated, the parts  maintain their indispensable ontogenetic status as the distinguishable elements of any relation: paradoxically, the relation generates the parts,  but without the implicit ‘pushing’ and  ‘pulling’ of the parts  no relation would take place. This principle delineates an ontological ground for ethics: it is not only a plurality of collaborating
