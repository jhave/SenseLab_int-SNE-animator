According to James, the individual self-relation is an extremely limited kind  of collaboration which  does not manage to link two different selves together: “my experiences and yours  float and dangle, terminating, it is true, in a nucleus of common perception, but for the most part  out of sight and irrelevant and unimaginable to one another” (1976: 47). The only possible relation between different selves unfolds itself in space as a mere ‘withness’ of external relations, like a break or a gap generating a constant need  of communication for the confirmation and  conformation of a shared commonality of objects and purposes. In James’ words, “I have to get on and  off again,  to pass from a thing lived to another thing  only conceived, and the break is positively experienced and  noticed” (1976: 25). Rather  than  being conceived as mere absence  or collaborative lack, the discontinuity of the break as the only possible reality
between selves is fully experienced as a further relational element, a constructive disjunction constituting that very ‘condition of uncertainty and  potential’ for research-creation-(as) collaboration to take place. In other  words, the significance (and  not the signification) of actual  communicative enunciations is doubled (rather than  weakened) by the potentiality of the break,  every  relation being based on the capacity to effectively  modulate continuities and  gaps and  to rhythmically ‘move’ together along them.  Communicative language, Massumi reminds us, is based  on the unproblematic and  flat “image of a self-governing reflective  individual whose  inner  life can be conveyed at will to a public composed of similarly sovereign individuals – rational atoms  of human experience in voluntary congregation, usefully sharing thoughts and experiences” (Massumi, 2003: xiii). Concepts and  practices of relational experience can only be encountered and  explored along  the uneven, rhythmic path  of expression, and  always at a certain  distance from the literal denotations and mono-tone unfolding of communication. Affect is not a continuous fluidity
but needs  to cut a space for itself and for its non-socially-connoted, non- linguistically-expressible resonance.
