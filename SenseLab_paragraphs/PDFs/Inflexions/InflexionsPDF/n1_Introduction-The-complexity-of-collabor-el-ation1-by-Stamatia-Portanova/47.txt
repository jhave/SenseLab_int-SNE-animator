It is enough that the question be posed with  sufficient force, (...), in order to quell rather than  incite any response. It is here that it discovers its properly ontological import, the (non)-being of the question which  cannot be reduced to the non-being of the negative. There are no ultimate or original responses or solutions, there  are only problem-questions, in the guise of a mask  behind every mask  and  a displacement behind every  place. (Deleuze,
2001: 107).
