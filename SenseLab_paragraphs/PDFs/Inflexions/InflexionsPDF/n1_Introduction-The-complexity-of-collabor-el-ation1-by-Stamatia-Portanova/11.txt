To be radical, an empiricism must  neither admit into its constructions any element that is not directly experienced, nor exclude from them  any element that is directly experienced. (...) Elements may indeed be redistributed, the original placing of things getting corrected, but a real place must  be found for every kind  of thing  experienced, whether term  or relation, in the final philosophic arrangement (James, 1976: 22).
