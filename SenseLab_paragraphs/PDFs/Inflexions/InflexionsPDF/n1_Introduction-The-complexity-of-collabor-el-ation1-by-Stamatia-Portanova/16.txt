James’s conceptualisation represents a fundamental (and often unnoticed)
turning point  in the Western philosophical landscape, not only because of its
‘renewed’ attention for the experiential reality  of the relation, but also because of its definition of the individual self as already implicating a collaborative relation between moments, cognitional elements or parts  (James, 1976: 25). Every concept of an individual always implies a relation, a not always easy or fluid collaborative substitution, between thoughts and  perceptions, between perceptions and actions, between the subject in formation and its own past-future selves.
