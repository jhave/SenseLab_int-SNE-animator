The solicitation and  motion of relations towards definiteness is the main  task of choreography. As much  as blueness is not only of a coat, speed and position, rhythm and  movement are of course  not only of dancers. As a consequence, Manning writes,  “It is a mistake to assign  choreography to a specific human body. (...) Forsythe asks: ‘is it possible for choreography to generate autonomous expressions of its principals, a choreographic object, without the body?’ Choreography happens everywhere, all the time.”  Thinking and writing ‘with’ (rather than  just looking at and  analysing) William  Forsythe’s choreographic practice, performances and installations, Manning realises  a generative collaboration between the ontogenetic value  of Whitehead’s notion of
‘proposition’ and  the specificity of choreography as a set of abstract configurations drawing the singularity of bodies  towards the creation of new movement possibilities. Her main question can be defined thus  as ‘meta- choreographic’, a way to ask the critical analysis of choreographic practice to become  ontogenetic and  produce its own conceptual variations, a re-working of the philosophical practice not from the inside  but from the in-between of its relations.
