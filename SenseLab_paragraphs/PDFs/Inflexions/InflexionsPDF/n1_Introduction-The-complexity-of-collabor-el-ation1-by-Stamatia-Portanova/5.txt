1 Special  thanks to the Sense  Lab and the Inflexions editorial board for generously allowing me to edit this issue,  and morally and materially supporting me throughout all the phases of the process. In particular, I would like to thank Erin Manning and Christoph Brunner for their precious assistance in the editorial work. Thanks to Celine Pereira, Natasha Prevost and Alanna Thain for their translation work, and a particularly special thanks to Leslie Plumb for her great organisational capacity and her inventiveness as a web  designer. Thanks also to Natasha Prevost and Bianca  Scliar, the editors of the Tangents section, for a challenging and ‘rhythmic’ process of collaboration-in-the-making, which was  never taken for granted by any  of us, and has now come to the stage of showing its outcomes.
