loss and  scattering of one’s selves in the intensity of rhythm, “towards an impersonal aesthetic as the world(’s) feeling.”  The impersonality of sensation is thus  the effect of an affective way to conceive  and  position the screen in a way that emphasises the relational aspect  of the performance and its different temporalities, against the conception of a full frontality of subjective interaction and  of a linear,  homogenous cinematic time. Multiple times encounter but also miss themselves in the expressive modality of the installation-performance: the audience’s lived time, the technological video time, the danced time of the performer... The aim (and  effect) of the video  installation, as shown by works such as Fabre’s L’Ange de la Mort but also by Antonin De Bemels’ Lilith (where the performance stage is replaced by the whole  urban scenario surrounding the video  installation), is “to make time appear as a relation between (...) varieties of
temporal extension.” Sensation, for Thain, occurs where rhythm meets  chaos: the
diverging temporalities of chaos as a field of potential are thought-felt together through an instantaneous intuition of duration. In this sense, the video- performance intermedial installation elicits a series of interconnected feelings and  thoughts about  time, its different values (technical and  organic, measured and  lived,  cut and continuous) and its different potentials for ‘manipulation’.
