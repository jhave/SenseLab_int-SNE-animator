The concept is that of the cut as infinite  possibility or potential, the cut as idea, but also the border or limit between differential and digital cut. In this sense, what the digital image  starts  to question is the very capacity or incapacity for thought, the spiritual ability to encounter difference (the dis-continuity in perception, the infinity  in the digital), its de-stabilising vibrations, while keeping an acrobatic meta-stable balance  on a de-subjectified ground. As Manning argues, thinking ‘with’ the digital image “is no longer  a question of analog or digital. It is a question to thought itself (...), the machinic potential of thought in motion (...) To not yet know  how to think:  aberrant movement spurs aberrant
thought” (Manning, 2008). To not yet know  how to think  the digital:  the aberrant question incites a serial proliferation of thoughts, each engaged in transversal, non-communicational relations with the moving images  on screen, each of them inevitably missing its mark,  and  at the same time re-directing its sense towards itself, towards thought ‘in itself’. As Thain reminds, the missed encounter always envelops a potential going  far beyond its apparent failure.  The question becomes thus  an exhortation to both technology and  the human to take their own sensitivity to its ‘nth’ level, to think  (or compute) what  Luciana  Parisi and  Steve Goodman define  as the “weirdness of mathematics”, or what  Gregory Chaitin defines as “sensual mathematics”, that is a way of thinking which  comes before, or beyond, the differentiation between ‘natural’ or ‘digital’ algorithms. The non- communicational gap between words and images  rhythmically develops and expands itself along  a common idea: the cut as the object of a non-human (or more-or-less-than-human) thought (or the attractor of a tendency towards thought).
