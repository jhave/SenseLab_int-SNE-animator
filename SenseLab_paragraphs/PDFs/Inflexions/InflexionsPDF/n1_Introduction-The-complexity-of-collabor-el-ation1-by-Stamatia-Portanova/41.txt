Differently from the Lilith video  installation, its ‘smooth’ perceptual quality and its ‘mixed’ intermedial temporality, De Bemel’s Trilogie Stroboscopique is a series of three  videos that dramatically emphasise the abruptness of the cut and its
‘sensational resonance’, through the use of the stroboscopic technique (a
fragmentation and  alternation of video  sequences frame  by frame),  in an extreme temporal quantification. Time “is minutely and  precisely cut, under the sign of
an infinitesimal divisibility allowed by the technical digitalisation:” frenetically
changing their configurations and  movements, the figures  on screen  are taken  to a maximum level of dis-continuous un-recognisability, in a sort of Cubist  re- composition. The effect responds, once again,  to a ‘logic of sensation’ which,  in Thain’s words, seems  to affectively transform the screen  into a vehicle of subjective and objective ‘alterfications’ and ‘de-personalisations’, a logic that is fluid  and broken at the same time. And yet, beyond their perceptual effects, the main  difference ‘embodied’ by these images  seems to be mainly ontological: not (or not simply) a matter of frames  and  montage anymore, the digital moving image  does not merely  ask perception and imagination to overcome their limits and  re-think the whole,  or the simultaneity of movement, in relation to time. It can be argued that this is something analog  cinema  already used  to do. Digital video  technology undergoes its main  challenge in its encounter and  collaboration with  a concept, or an eternal object of conceptualisation: “The whole  forms a knowledge, (...) which  brings  together the image  and the concept as two movements each of which  goes towards the other” (Deleuze, 2005: 156). The relation needs  to be conceptually felt.
