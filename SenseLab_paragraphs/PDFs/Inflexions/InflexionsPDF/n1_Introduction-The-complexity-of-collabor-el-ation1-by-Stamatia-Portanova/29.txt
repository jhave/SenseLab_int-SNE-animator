From the universality and virtuality of the function as creativity in itself, a potentiality appears through the individuation of one specific structure of possible relations: it is what  Whitehead defines as a proposition, a productive constraint that incites a decisive  break  or a turning point  in the general activity. Relations need  to be ‘guided’. In Erin Manning’s words, a proposition is an invitation to experiment within a particular set of parameters, for example of body, space and movement parameters: in this sense, a proposition can be said to
‘animate’ a sort of choreographic collaboration between ideas and bodies, eliciting  action and change in a specific environment. In Process and Reality, Whitehead defines propositions as connections of certain  actual  entities  in their
‘potentiality’ of forming a nexus.  A proposition is a form of definiteness for actualities yet to be formed, the conceptual realisation of a definite nexus whose propositional value  is based  on the correspondence between what  is experienced as physically prehended (actual)  and what  is conceptually felt as possible:  “I apprehend blueness as realised in a coat and  as possible elsewhere” (Bradley  et al, 2003). A proposition intervenes in order to shape  and  guide, or to
