tendencies and levels of experience (which  also resonates with  the Whiteheadian physical/conceptual poles). All the thinkers mentioned seem to agree on one point:  the physicality of the movements of a body  always implies the abstraction and  ‘impersonality’ of its relational potential, as a capacity for conceptual prehension or ‘thought’, collaboration ‘on the surface’. The virtuality of a concrete collaboration therefore corresponds to a reality  exceeding its own actualisation, an excessive  residual precipitate or, in Massumi’s words, a latent energetic potential that stays with  bodies  as their  potential ‘connectability’.
