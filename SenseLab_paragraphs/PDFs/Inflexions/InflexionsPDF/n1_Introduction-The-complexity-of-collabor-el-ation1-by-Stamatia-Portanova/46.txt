As a journal of collabor(el)ational research-creation, Inflexions is based  on two pre-emptive assumptions: the relational nature of collaboration, and  the paradoxical nature of thought as a relation with  difference in itself; as such, collaboration cannot be other  than  thought. The basic question addressed in the current issue, to which  all the collected  works  respond in different ways, is how to think  (and therefore collaborate with) difference, how to draw a rhythmic nexus  out of this encounter. Each work  therefore activates and  expands the thinking of an empirical difference: philosophy and concepts in relation to choreography, dance,  performance-installation, video  technology, or even thought in itself. But beyond the description or explanation of things (the algorithmic or compressive tendency of thought to encapsulate difference into precise  concepts or programs), what  these experiments manage to do is to actualise a different way to think  thought, this time as an infinite  tendency towards complexity, an affirmation of ‘questioning’ and ‘problematisation’ considered as processes with  an intrinsic value  of their own. Rather  than  finding solutions, a successful collabor(el)ation will try to leave the question intact in its force and in its creative challenge, because, as Deleuze reminds,
