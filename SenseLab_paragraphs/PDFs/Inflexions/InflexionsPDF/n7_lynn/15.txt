Within  the  footprint of a cottage  lives  a villaâ€™s worth of surfaces. Quite  simply, you sleep on the ceiling, bath  on the wall and  live on the floor. The RV Prototype rotates through 270 degrees of vertical  motion and  360 degrees of motion in the ground plane.  Within  the  footprint of 40m2  is over  100m2  of livable  surface.  In this case less volume is more surface.
