The RV Prototype brings  intelligent movement and compact comfort  to the living space  as an alternative to over-inflated ‘McMansions’ by reducing footprint and material  while   also  bringing  the  enthusiasm  and   activity   of  theme  park,   a hamster ball, an exercise  machine, a natural landscape or sporting equipment to the  human living  sphere. The living  space  does  not  move  around you  to make you comfortable, but instead you are rolled  and  must  climb, tumble, traverse and spelunk across  the  ergonomic surface  like a mountain goat,  a Pilates  disciple, a Parkour Tracuer or wannabe Spiderman. Instead of a baronial interior of luxury materials, in order to be movable, the materials and  construction methods of the RV Prototype replace  masonry and  steel  with  lightweight, high  strength cloth bonded to either  a wood or cork core. To be affordable and  responsible the 60m2 living space is distributed across the surface  of the interior rather than  just across the floor; thereby reducing the literal and energy footprint.
