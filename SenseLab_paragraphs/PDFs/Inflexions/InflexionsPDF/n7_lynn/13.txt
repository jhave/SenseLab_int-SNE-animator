We expect  our environments to have  some of the same  qualities as the other technologies  that    have    insinuated   themselves  into   our   lifestyle.    Moving, adaptable, dynamic, bespoke and  intelligent objects  surround us  from transportation, to  clothing,  to  entertainment, to  communications. High performance is not the same  as function. Today,  performance is related to desire more than  a common benchmark of use.
