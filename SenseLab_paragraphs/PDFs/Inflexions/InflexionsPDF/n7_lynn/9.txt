By  building  in  cloth  structures made   rigid   with   glue  we  are  able  to  orient materials  at  the   fiber   scale   for  construction.  Looking   at  the   materials and construction logic  of boats,  planes and  formula one  cars  it is possible to build large   scale  structures  that   are  incredibly  light   and   strong.  Whereas  a  60m2 pavilion made  in wood, steel, glass or brick is measured in millions of pounds a carbon  reinforced composite structure like this is measured in the thousands; less than   1/1000th  the  weight of  conventional construction. So  a  square meter   of carbon  can cost 1000 times  more  than  a similar  square meter  of brick and  still be comparably priced. Once  light  enough, these  building elements can  be moved and manipulated with very little effort.
