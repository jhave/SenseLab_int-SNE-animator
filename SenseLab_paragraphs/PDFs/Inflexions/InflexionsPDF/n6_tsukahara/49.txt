In conclusion, I would like to remind you, dear  audience of AG 3, the declaration of  our  great   Dadaist,  Tristan   Tzara   in  Zurich,   1919: ”L’art  s’endort  pour  la naissance du monde nouveau [The art is sleeping waiting for the birth  of the new world]. ” Almost  a century passed since then,  and  now  in the Reversible Destiny Lofts, I really  feel something unprecedented has  come  into  existence.  Is the new art  going  to be awakened, the  new  world born  in order to reverse the  Destiny? This  is the  most  important question we  are  now  trying to  find  the  answer to through the persistent approach to the works  and thoughts of Arakawa & Gins.
