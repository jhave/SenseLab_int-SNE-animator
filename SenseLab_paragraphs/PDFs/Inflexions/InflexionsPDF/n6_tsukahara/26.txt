The “Intensity” and  “Meaninglessness” of Tzara  was  combined in this notorious work  of “art”  (which  is in reality  “anti-art”), “Fontaine / Fountain” (Photo No. 2) by Marcel  Duchamp, 1917 because, his action  of presenting the  white  porcelain urinal at the Art Exhibition (even “Independent”) has an undeniable “intensity”; a risky  but,  as a result,  successful attack  against the  fine  arts.  This  “thing” (an urinal) is meaningless except for its ordinary use in the toilet.
