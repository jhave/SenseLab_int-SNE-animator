So, let us get back to the subject. First of all, I have to reaffirm the undeniable fact that   Arakawa  is  considered  as  one   of  the   foremost  artistic   figures   on  the international art scene after  World  War II, among Pollock,  Jasper  Johns, Warhol, Joseph  Beuys,  Cesar,  Louise  Bourgeois, etc. But now,  he does  not  use  the  word “artist” for  his  identification. He  says  he  is  a  “codenologist”. This  neologism signifies  a creator  who  attempts to integrate art, science  and  philosophy so that he or she could  realize  their unification. What does it mean?
