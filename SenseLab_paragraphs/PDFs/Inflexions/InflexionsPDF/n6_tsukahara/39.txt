So, what   is  the  “Mechanism of  Meaning”? Here  we  have  to  look  back  again Dada’s  Intensity and  Meaninglessness, because these  concepts were  desperate efforts  to challenge “the  human condition” that  requires everything that  exists should  have   its  ‘proper’   meaning.  Dada,   considered  Meaninglessness  as  a necessary condition for  art  to  have  Intensity, but  in  this  case,  art  wouldn’t be “art”  any more.
