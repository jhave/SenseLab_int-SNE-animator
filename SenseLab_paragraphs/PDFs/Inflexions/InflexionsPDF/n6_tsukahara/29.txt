After  this  “Big Bang”,  modern art  had  to pass  through Rough  Road  for several decades, political  revolutions, totalitarianisms, wars;  at the end of which  modern art  has  found its new  name  “Pop  Art”  and  had  arrived to a new  stage  named “consumer  society”   where  everything  had   become   a  sign  in  the  sense   that Saussure defined in his  Cours de linguistique  générale (1916). Jean Baudrillard,  a French  sociologist and  old friend  of mine passed away  three  years  ago in Paris at the  age of 77. He mentioned in his Consumer Society (La société de consommation, ses mythes, ses structures, 1970) that  everyday objects (e.g. a porcelain urinal, etc.) “have  been fragmented” (by Cubism), and  “having celebrated their  parodic resurrection in Dada  and  Surrealism, they  are  apparently now  reconciled again with their image  in neo-figuration and pop art”( 1998: 115 ).
