The  purpose of my  article  is to  review Arakawa’s trajectory from  his  Kan-Oké (Coffin) series  in late 50s and  early  60s, to the monumental Lofts at the debut of the 21st century. Before entering upon the main subject of my article, I would like to  refer  to  a  very   personal  experience of  myself   -  my  first  encounter  with Arakawa in October  1993.
