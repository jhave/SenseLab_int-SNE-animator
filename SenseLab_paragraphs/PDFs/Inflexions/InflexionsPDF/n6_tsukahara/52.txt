[1] This  article  is based  on  my  lecture  at  the  Reversible Destiny Lofts,  Mitaka City, Tokyo, February 2010 as a participation to the Third  International Arakawa and  Gins Conference (AG3 ) online,  coordinated by Griffith  University, Australia (March  2010).   I deeply appreciate Ms. Momoyo Honma, Director of the Architectural Body  Research   Foundation’s Tokyo  Office,  whose   kindness has enabled me to use the Lofts for the video  recording of my lecture,  as well as Dr. Jondi  Keane,  Senior  Lecturer at  Griffith  University, whose  devoted effort  has realized admirably the  project  of AG  3 online.  At  that  time,  who  could  have imagined the  sudden passing of Arakawa in May  2010, who  has  decided categorically “not to die”?  I would like to dedicate this short  essay in memory of our  ARAKAWA,  who  will  “never die”  in  a  conventional sense  of  this  “old- fashioned” word (September 2011, Tokyo).
