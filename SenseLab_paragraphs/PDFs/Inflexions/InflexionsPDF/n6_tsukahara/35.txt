Like  their  predecessors in  the  western world, Japanese Neo  Dada     violently attacked morals of contemporary society.  They  pissed in  the  Exhibition Room and  walked along  the Ginza  Street  (the 5th Avenue in Tokyo)  with  bandages all over  their  bodies,   etc.  As  we  could  imagine, those  kinds   of  events   were  not allowed to continue for a long time, and ended in a few months. The main  reason for the disorganization of Neo Dada  was  the breakup of group members, and  as Arakawa hated that  kind  of discord, he made  up his mind to go to New  York to find a New  World  for his “Art”  (because at that  time, he still considered himself as an “artist”).
