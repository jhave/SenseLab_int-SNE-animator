In  one  of his  Dada  manifestoes, Manifeste de Monsieur  Antipyrine  (1916), Tzara screamed, “Dada est notre  intensité!”(“Dada is our  Intensity!”). In his Manifeste Dada (1918), he wrote with  capital  letters,  “DADA  NE SIGNIFIE RIEN” (“DADA MEANS  NOTHING”). We  use  the  English  translation by  Madame Mary  Ann Caws  (2005) whose   immense contribution to  the  study of  Dada-Surrealism  is well-known all over the world.
