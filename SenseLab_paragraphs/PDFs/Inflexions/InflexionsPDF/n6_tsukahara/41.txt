And  with  this recognition begins  the great  transition from  Art to Anti-Art, from Death   to  Life,  in  a  sense  that  once  the  pieces  of  Art  (even  Dada’s  and  Neo Dada’s)  have  been gathered in museums defined as masterpieces, they  would be nothing but like Dead  Bodies in the huge  coffins. And  only the tenet  of Anti-Art (Quest  for Intensity and  Meaninglessness) could  reverse the  situation. (We use the   word  “Meaninglessness”  for   “Nonsense”,  because  the   latter    may   be understood as “absurdity” which  has  the  specific  “meaning” of existentialism.) From  this  point  of view,  the  Reversible Destiny  Lofts would already have  come into view.
