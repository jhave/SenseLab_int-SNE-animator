After  the  worldwide success  of Mechanism of Meaning in 1970s (German Nobel Prize  Physicist Werner Heisenberg highly  appreciated this  work),  “Death is old fashioned” has  become   the  beacon-words to  lead  the  “Work   in  Progress” of Arakawa and  Gins for several  decades. And,  in autumn 1995, in a small  town  of Yoro (Gifu prefecture), four hundred kilometers west of Tokyo, Arakawa & Gins created a kind  of theme park,  the Site of Reversible Destiny, an elliptical site of two acres with  a dozen of original architectures where visitors can feel their  sense  of everyday life changing by going  through a dark  tunnel without light or trying to enter  into a cabin whose  door  cannot  be opened, and so on.
