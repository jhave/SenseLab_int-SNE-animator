Tzara  was  one  of the  key  persons of the  European Avant-garde,  who   created  the   DADA   movement  in   Zurich,    Switzerland, February 1916 at the famous Cabaret Voltaire  during the First World  War, with Hugo Ball, Hans  Arp,  Hans  Richter,  Richard Huelsenbeck, etc.  (this  historical place  has  been  totally  renewed and  re-opened as a Caf√©-Bar  at the beginning of the 21st Century).
