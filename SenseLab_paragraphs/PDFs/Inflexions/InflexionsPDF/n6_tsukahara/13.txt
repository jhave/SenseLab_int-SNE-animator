The convention site was formed with  a dozen round tables  with  specific themes; one of which  I was invited as a specialist of Dada  and  Surrealism, to have  a short speech   about   artistic   experiments  of  the   Avant-garde  movement  past   and present. To my great  and  happy surprise, the organizer had  designated my place next to that of a man whom I have never  met before, but just sitting  next to him, I recognized in no time who  he was. Indeed, the man  was Arakawa himself  (aged
57). Because,  as my  study on  Dada  and  Surrealism started at  a seminar at  the University of Paris (Sorbonne Nouvelle) in the 70s had  extended, after returning to Japan,  to Neo  Dada  in the  60s, I had  seen  his  visage  in his  legendary “two shot”  photo with Marcel Duchamp.
