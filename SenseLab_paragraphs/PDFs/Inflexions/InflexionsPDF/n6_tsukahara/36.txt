In December 1961, Arakawa arrived in New  York City with  a letter  of recommendation to Marcel  Duchamp prepared by Shuzo  Takiguchi, one  of the greatest Japanese critics  of Modern Art  after  the  World  War  II.   After  meeting Duchamp and,  in  the  following year,  Madeline Gins  (whom he  married soon after  and  never  separated), his long  process  to the Reversible Destiny Lofts had begun.
