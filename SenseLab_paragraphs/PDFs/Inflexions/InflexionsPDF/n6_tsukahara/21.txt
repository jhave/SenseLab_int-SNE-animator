These  two  signposts have  a  double meaning for  us.  First,  they  announce the Artistic  Monument DADA is nearby, and  second, after these  posts,  Rough  Road. This  is a pure  coincidence and  not  intended at  all  as  double meaning by  the Romanian  Road   Authority,  but   if  you   understand these   signs   as  follows   –
”Proceed with  caution!   DADA  ahead, and  after  DADA,  Rough   Road!”—you could  call to mind the whole  history of modern art in the 20th century.
