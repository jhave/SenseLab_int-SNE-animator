In Japan,  the  adventure of Neo  Dada  was  very  intense but  very  short.  In April
1960  in  Tokyo,   young  artists   gathered  to  create   a  new   group  “Neo   Dada Organizer”. Among them  were  Shinohara, Yoshimura and  our  Arakawa. They realized the  first  Neo  Dada  Exhibition, and  attracted a great  deal  of attention from journalists. After this historical event,  Arakawa had  exhibited his “Kan- Oké”(Coffins) in January 1961; So called  because it was  a large  mass  of heavy cement  whose  form  reminds us the shape  of a dead (fossilized) fetus  laid  with  a
purple velvet in the wood box like a coffin.
