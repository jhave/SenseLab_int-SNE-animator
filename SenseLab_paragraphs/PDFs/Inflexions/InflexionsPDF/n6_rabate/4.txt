In  this  case,  beyond the  personal trauma and  the  block,  there  was  a  further intellectual crux  for me,  and  it was  that  which  blocked me  most  at first  in my endeavors to express something:  how  can  one  talk  about  the  death of an  artist who has decided not to die?  Then I happened to reopen a book I had  skimmed a few  years  ago,  Sõseki  Natsume’s Japanese novel  from  1905, I am a cat. In  the middle of the novel  narrated by a hilariously spunky and  cynical  cat, a cat who has never  been named by his owner, a stray  cat barely  accepted in a household,  I found these  words: “I’ve decided not  to die.” [1] This is not  the cat who  speaks but  his  owner, a  hypochondriac teacher of  English  literature who  looks  very much  like the author.
