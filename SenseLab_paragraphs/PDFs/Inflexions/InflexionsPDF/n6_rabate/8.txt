What  I’d like to convey  is that  the discovery that  Arakawa’s main  statement – “I have decided not to die,” hence “We have decided not to die” – was a quote  from a famous Japanese novel  and  has something liberating. It suddenly unlocked the store of my fond  memories of him, vignettes of him as a witty  speaker, images  of him  as  a  dreamily silent  observer when Madeline Gins  read  her  obituary for Jacques  Derrida in New  York, for instance. Arakawa was a wonderful artist  who had  turned militant for  a change in  human consciousness. We know  that  cats have  nine  lives,  whereas their  owners have  only  one—but when that  one  is so productive, so  charged with  multiple intensities, one  can  swallow one’s  tears, forget  one’s grief  and  find  in this  death that  it is also a non-death, an immense source  of courage for the future.
