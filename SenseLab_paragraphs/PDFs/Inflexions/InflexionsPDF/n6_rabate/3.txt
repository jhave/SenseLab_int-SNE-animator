Each time, the whole  world dies: each time it is the end of the world. This is how Derrida momentously defined the experience of bereavement one experiences when a friend  dies.  I confess  that  I could  find  no better  phrase when I heard of Arakawaâ€™s demise. I was indeed shattered and  stymied, unable to write  or speak, even  to express to Madeline Gins  what  was  more  than  a loss,  what  I felt as a personal wound.
