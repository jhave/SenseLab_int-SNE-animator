However, in the novel, quite  surprisingly and  shockingly, it is the cat who dies at the  end—he drowns trapped in a jar after  having drunk beer  for the  first  time. But his  death is a liberation, a coming  to peace  with  the  universe. Indeed, this was  the  only  way  for  Sõseki  Natsume to  finish  his  endless novel,  a  sort  of Japanese Tristram Shandy.  But while  in Sterne’s  masterpiece, the hero  can never bring  back  the  narrative to  the  moment of his  to  birth,  here  the  death of the narrator as a cat ensures the  immortality of the  author. The novel  is still today one  of Japan’s  best  known and  most  loved  narratives. This  is not  the  place  to discuss the novel,  replete as it is with  echoes  of Zen Buddhism, full of hilarious parodies of a Western culture seen through the eyes of a Japanese cat. In all this, one perceives that death is nothing, and that personal illumination is all.
