Coroner  Haraway  has   one   of  the   Hadaly  bodies   in  her   lab,  where  she  is investigating the source  of the malfunction and  Batou and  Togusa  join her there to discuss the  case. It’s clear  from  the  beginning that  Haraway’s sympathies lie with  the  Hadalys.  She chides  Batou  for having shot  one  of them  with  a highly destructive bullet  and  laments the  contemporary fate of many  of these  types  of being (in the year 2032) who, once doomed to obsolescence, are forced  to wander aimlessly or  take  their  own  lives.  She,  Batou,  and   Togusa   then  engage in  a philosophical exchange in which  Haraway asserts  that  the difference between humans and  machines has  always been  merely “an  article  of  faith.”  Togusa, always the  voice  of more  conventional humanist principles, balks  at Haraway’s assertions, and  Batou acts as a kind  of speculative mediator, telling  a story  about Descartes’ construction of an automaton which  would come  to replace  his dead daughter in his affections.
