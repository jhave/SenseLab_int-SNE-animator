This scene is, of course,  Fellini’s own nostalgic, auto-elegiac, look back at his own career,  but  it  is  also  a  profound  reflection on  the  cultural  significance of  the cinematic apparatus  itself,  and  particularly of its  very  special  relation to  time, life, and  death. As Fellini’s scene presents it, as a luminous, indexical inscription of a pro-filmic real, cinema’s  projected images  and  sounds revivify  the world as it returns what  has  passed, and  what  has  passed, along  with  the  dead, always haunt the time-space of cinema’s  projected present. [1] If, as Vivian  Sobchack  so aptly  suggests, cinema  is a form  of cosmetic  surgery—”its fantasies, its makeup, and its digital effects able to ‘fix’ (in the doubled sense of repair and stasis) and to fetishize and  to reproduce faces and  time  as both  ‘unreel’ in front  of us”—it  is, like its surgical counterpart, also always shadowed by its own  undoing, haunted by the specter of temporality and decay (Sobchack  2012: 50).
