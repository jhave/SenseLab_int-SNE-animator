What’s most  interesting for our purposes here, however, is that  in the conclusion to “Dim  Stockings” quoted above  Agamben in fact calls for the very  scenario that we’ve  already seen  realized in the  space  of the  animatic apparatus:  that  is, “to link together image  and  body  in a space  where they  can no longer  be separated” (Agamben  2000:50).  From   the   fantastic  dimension  of  the   animatic  body   as presented in  the  Esurance ad  campaign to  its  more  material  versions in  the plastic  surgeries of  Heidi  Montag, or  the  multi-modal transformations of  the Real-Life Barbie, and  from the new biotechnological processes Franklin and  Lock describe to the  cinematic-animatic compositings that  produce the  digital bodies of Lord of the Rings,  Avatar,  etc.—the  hallmark of these  animatic bodies  is that they  “link  together image  and  body  in  a  space  where they  can  no  longer  be separated.”   In the  passage quoted from  “Dim  Stockings” Agamben also refers to the body  he summons as “a whatever body” and  he explains it—in reference to  both  the  quodlibet of  Scholastic   philosophy and  the  photographic lens—as “being  such  that  it always matters.” The whatever body  is a kind  of singularity inseparable from all of its own predicates but unrelated to any model—except by a “resemblance without archetype” (Agamben 1993: 48).  It no longer  maintains a reference to a theological origin,  or to any  model, except  through the  “Idea” of resemblance,  a  resemblance without  actual   substance. The  “whatever body,” with  all of its determinate indeterminacy, feels very  static in its insistence on the maintenance of  the  logic  of  resemblance—as  well  as  in  its  insistence on  the absolute  qualification of  being.   It’s  hard to  imagine  that   “the   new   body   of humanity,” given  the  field  of  forces  from  which   it  is  emerging, could   be  so definitely in possession of its attributes.
