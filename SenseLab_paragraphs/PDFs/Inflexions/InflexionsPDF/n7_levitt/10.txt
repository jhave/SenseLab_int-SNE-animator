Anita  as our  exemplar, four current bodies  confront not just one but four former selves,  and  each  confrontation is slightly  different. She is nobody in particular looking  across  time  at this  revivification of a youthful body.   At the  same  time she is the private person, Anita  Eckberg,  looking  at a younger version of her personally identified self. She is also a character in one film looking  at a character in another, an aging  actress  watching a young one in a now-iconic film, and  an aging  actress  looking  at herself  not  only  as a young actress,  but  as a young star actress  playing the  ur-type of the  screen  goddess.  In this  relay  of bodies,  the older  one cries from nostalgia for youth or dismay at age (or both), and the “real” body—despite  its  visual   and   visceral   presence—is  so  overdetermined  as  to almost  collapse  under the  combined weight(lessness) of the  spectacle’s  spectral bodies.  It’s a story  of time’s passing.  Its pathos comes  from  the pathos of aging itself  with  its implication of the  inevitability of death, from  the  particularity of this “tragedy” for the female  body,  the movie  star, and  the female  star even more particularly, but  also from  the relationship between the “real”  and  the cinematic body—the former’s  subjection  to  the  vagaries of  time,  decay,  and  death only amplified by the latter’s silvery,  luminous vitality.
