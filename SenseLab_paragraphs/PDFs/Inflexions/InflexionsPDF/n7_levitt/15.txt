It would, in fact, be almost  impossible to overstate cinema’s  mutual imbrication with  both popular and  theoretical discourses of life—and  practices of liveliness— across  the twentieth century. As Giorgio  Agamben suggests, we can see cinema (broadly conceived) as  a  kind  of  “eye”  with  a  very  particular relation to  the living,  human body  (Agamben 2000: 50). One of its most  essential technical precursors, the chronophotographic camera, was developed in the physiology station of Étienne-Jules Marey  and  also played a central  role in the development of  the   emerging  discipline  of  physiology.    In  this   context,   its  role  was   to transcend the  speed of the  human eye  in order to break  down gesture into  its constituent parts.  This  new  technologized vision  was  able  to  see  the  body  in ways   that   human  perception could   not,  thus   making  it  available  to  study, analysis, and  biopolitical management. One  of Marey’s students proclaims that he  is  not  so  much  a  scientist as  “an  engineer of  life,”  [5] and  his chronophotographs have  in  fact  a proscriptive as  well  as  descriptive function, one which  will find its most  famous incarnation in the methods of “scientific management” inaugurated by  Frederick Winslow Taylor’s  industrial efficiency and  productivity analyses of just  a few  decades later.   But even  before  Taylor, and  Taylorism, Marey  insists  that  photographic analyses of human movement can help soldiers to clean their guns  more  effectively  and  athletes to execute  their gymnastic feats more efficiently.
