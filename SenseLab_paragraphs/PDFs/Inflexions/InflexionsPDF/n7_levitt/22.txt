As we can see from  this catalogue of entries into the 20th  century’s discourses of cinematic life,  there’s  a kind  of insistence on  cinema’s  inseparability from  life even   where  the   discourses  diverge,  careening  from   the   Lumières’   “perfect illusion of  life”  to  Ramsaye’s   “organic” cinema   and  Kracauer’s life-as-reality. From   France   to  Hollywood  to  Cinecittà  and   far  beyond,  the   world  of  the twentieth-century  is   shaped  by   the   spectral-spectacular life/death   of   the cinematic  image.   While   there’s   no   doubt  that   discourses  and   practices  of cinematic life are  multiple—and at  times  competing, even  contestatory—there are several  general conclusions we can draw about  this regime and  its modes of production: 1) Cinematic life develops with  the  ascendance of the  biopolitical ratio and  is inseparable from its mode  of envisioning the human body  and  its life processes.  2) It is likewise  linked  with  what  we might  call the cinematic “reality function,” that is, the means  through which  at least much  of 20th  century film and film theory understands itself as existing,  if complexly, in relation to what  is commonly referred to as a “profilmic real.”   3) Finally, as Louis-George Schwartz remarks, this 20th  century cinematic spectrality casts the philosopheme life/death into   an   undecidable,  aporetic  relation.  Its  liveliness  is  always  ambivalent, oscillating, haunted. The cinematic regime operates in and  as a kind  of crisis  in ontology.
