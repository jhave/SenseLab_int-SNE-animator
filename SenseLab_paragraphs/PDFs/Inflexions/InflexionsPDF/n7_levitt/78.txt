In Oshii’s  diagnosis of the  animatic regime, emblematized in  the  figure  of the doll, we saw  the manner in which,  in the absence  of ontological determinations, affect  and  process  emerge as dominant forces.  Affect  and  sensation are  always primary modalities for  the  simulacrum, as  I discuss elsewhere. [20] Descartes’ feelings  for his doll-daughter and the care he shows  for her are what  is at stake in Oshii’s  version of the  tale,  and  in  Haraway’s  comparison of doll  rearing and child   care,  it  is  the  similarities  of  sensation and   affect  involved  in  the  two processes and  their  gestures that  open  the  comparison—or equivalence—of the two.  Oshii  comments in  an  interesting way  about  his  own  relationship to  the film’s  affects,  saying  that  the  film  is  both  about   the  body  or  rather that  “the message of this movie  is your  body” and  that  the film is good  for the body  (“as I got older,  nowadays, I make  a film that  is good  for my body).” “Before that,”  he continues, “I used  to make  a film  only  using  my  brain.” Oshii  here  asserts  the centrality of questions and  modes of embodiment, affect, and  feeling  to both  the narrative concerns and  formal  operations of the film—and, by extension—to the contemporary cultural world the film addresses.
