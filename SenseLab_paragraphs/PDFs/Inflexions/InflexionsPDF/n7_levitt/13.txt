I want  to emphasize this feature of the film as what  it, and  I, am describing is as much   an  aesthetic  ideology  of  the  cinematic apparatus—and  of  the  cultural world of the  twentieth-century—as it is a description of cinema’s  material and technical coordinates.  These certainly play  a role, but contrary to the doxa  of 70s apparatus theory, they  are always open  to the play  of other  kinds  of forces. That is, while  the  material and  institutional structures of both  cinema  and  animation play   important  roles,   they   can  never   fully   determine  spectatorial  positions, textual  meanings,  or   cultural  formations.  Following  Lamarre’s  use   of  this concept,  I see  them  as  underdetermining  features of cultural formations, contributing one set to a broader field of conditions of possibility. [3] The kind  of apparatus that  Fellini  reveals  to us here—highlighting the  imbrication of image practices and  discourses around life, death, gender, desire,  and  magic—has more in common with  Michel  Foucault’s broader notion of the apparatus, or dispositif, than  it does  with  Jean-Louis Baudry’s “ideological effects of the  basic cinematic apparatus.” [4]
