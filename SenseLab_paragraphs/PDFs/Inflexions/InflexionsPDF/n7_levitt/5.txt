I will argue  in this essay that  while  cinema  was the dominant medium of the 20th century, the  dominant medium of the  21st  century, or of what  we know  of it so far,  is  animation—here broadly  conceived as  encompassing  a  wide   array   of cultural productions from  cartoons per se to modes of simulation used  across aesthetic and  scientific  practices. The  kind  of life that  is at  stake  in  this  form whose  name  declares its vocation as making-live will become  the central  target  of analysis in what  follows  and  I will  contend that  we’re  seeing  a notable shift  in this  domain as animation moves  us toward what  I’m calling  an-ontological  life. Instead of launching right  into  animation and  its  emergent forms,  however,  I want  to begin  with  a look  back  at the  cinematic regime to develop a context,  a comparative framework, for discussing this transformation.
