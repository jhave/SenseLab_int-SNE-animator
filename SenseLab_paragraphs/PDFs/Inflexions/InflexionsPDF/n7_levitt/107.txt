[6]  “Vitality  affects”  is a category developed by Daniel  Stern  to distinguish and analyze a set of felt sensations of vitality (e.g., explosive, bursting, fading) from categorical affects  (e.g.,  anger,  joy fear).  The Interpersonal World of the Infant: A View  from Psychoanalysis and Developmental Psychology. New  York:  Basic Books,
1985. He  develops this  concept  further, as  “vitality forms,”  and  in  relation to cinema  and  the  other  arts  in  Forms of Vitality:  Exploring Dynamic  Experience in Psychology,  the  Arts,  Psychotherapy,  and  Development.  Oxford   and   New   York: Oxford  University Press, 2010.
