terms  of a luminous, spectral life haunted by temporality, decay,  and  death, but rather in exchanges between the  infinite  potential for animatic metamorphoses and  the  limiting features that  in each  sub-medium and  in each  particular case shape    and    define    it,   that    is,   between   animation’s   various   engines   of transformation  and   their   respective  drag   coefficients.   In  animation  no  body fulfills the function of the human body  for cinema,  where (though this of course obtains only  in cinematic and  not  in animatic forms  of cinema)  it grounds and unifies  its operations. If analyses of biopower were  contemporaneous with  the cinematic regime and  spoke  to its particular conditions, the  very  concept  of an animatic regime raises  the  question of what  happens to  bio-politics where the notion of bio—and the mediological image  of the (usually) human body  to which it was so closely linked—is displaced into the virtualization of life that  we see in animatic  forms   in  which   image-body-life  are  always  passing  into  or  out  of existence.  The concept  of the animatic apparatus thus  calls on us to re-think all of the features of the discourse on biopolitics that  constellate around its prefix,  bio, whether this  is interpreted in terms  of Aristotelian logics of life as in Agamben, in relation to the historically-specific field of the epistemologies and  practices of biology   and   the  modes of  governmentality  they  engender or  intersect, as  in Foucault, or  in  terms  of immunitas and  communitas as  in  Roberto  Esposito’s work.  While  my  own  focus  is  not  on  governmentality and  concrete   forms  of political  action  but  rather, as I’ve suggested, on media ethology as the modes of experience and  action  engendered by the medium-image-body nexus,  there’s  no doubt that these spheres are intimately bound—or rather, different analytic strata of the same  possibility space.  The body  is always an image,  the image  always a body  (the  human body,  Hans  Belting  insists,  is the  original medium) and  their particular informations and  implications at a given  moment determine potential fields of action (and inaction) (Belting 2005).
