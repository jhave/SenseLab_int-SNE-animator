suggests that we are all already cyborgs,  hybrids of human and  machine, biology and  cybernetics, and  that  this  is a good  thing,  at least  potentially. She explains that   cyborg   being   is  constituted  by   three   central   boundary  breakdowns— between  machine and   organism, human  and   animal, and   physical and   non- physical. While  Haraway  recognizes the  cyborg’s  genesis  as  a  product of  the patriarchal  military-industrial  complex, she  suggests that  illegitimate children can  be extremely unfaithful to their  origins,  and  calls for a cyborg  politics  that would equip feminism and  socialism to  face  the  special  challenges of contemporary technoculture and  its political-economic coordinates by taking responsibility  for  the  blurring of  boundaries and  the  creation of  new  forms, rather than   by  trying to  reinstate already defunct pure   categories of  human, animal, or machinic being.
