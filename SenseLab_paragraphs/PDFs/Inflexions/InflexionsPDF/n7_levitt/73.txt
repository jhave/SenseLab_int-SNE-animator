come   across   as  a  transmedia  mimicry.  In  others,   its  simulation   of  cinema constitutes a commentary on it, as well  as a kind  of opening of the cinematic to other  dimensions and  possibilities. One  of the  distinctive features of the  history of  moving-image animation is  in  fact  its  particular relation to  representation. Where  animation figures,  it is also produces a theory of figuration. Because it has no necessary links  to the real spaces  and  times  of photographic media, where it chooses  to represent aspects of a “real”  world it has to build  from the ground up, thus  implicitly thematizing whatever codes  of realism it chooses  to deploy (or to subvert). One  could  say this  of any  non-photographic medium, but  animation’s specificity lies both in its material movement in time and  its historical connection with   cinematic  representation.   Together  these   construct  its   very   particular relation to modalities of “realism.” Of course,  conventions within animation itself have  developed in  different genres  and  national traditions of animation itself, and  where these  are  used  without comment, they  also  become  “invisible.” But because of the  very  infinite  possibilities of animatic figuration, animation has  a unique ability   to  comment  on  conventional  codes  of  figuration and representation, as well  as to reflect  upon the  existential, perceptual coordinates they conventionally represent.
