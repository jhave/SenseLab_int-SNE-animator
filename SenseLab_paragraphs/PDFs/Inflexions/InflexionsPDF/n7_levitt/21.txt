We can see Kracauer’s comment as a kind  of theoretical elaboration of Fellini’s cinematic version, but here with  an explicit  emphasis placed on “psychophysical correspondences,” on a sub-representational, visceral  unconscious of the cinema which  Kracauer reads  as intrinsic to its vitality effects and  affects. [6] Or perhaps it  would be  more  apt,  and  a  more  powerful assertion, as  framed in  reverse: Cinema  is   composed  of   vitality  affects   that   link   its   images    to   material phenomena,  and   it  is  from   these   psychophysical  correspondences  that   “its emotional and intellectual contents emerge.”
