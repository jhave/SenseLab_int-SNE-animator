projection  coincide,  in the  latter  they  do  not.  While  both  function via  the  any- instant-whatever of 24 frames  per second (or at least 18 in the case of animation) animation is characterized by  the  difference in  temporality of production and projection. The animator, or animators, must  engage with  each frame  and  though there  must  ultimately be a minimum of 18 frames  per second, one frame  can take and  hour  or a year  to produce. This difference in temporal structure has definite consequences for cinematic bodies  and,  most  importantly for our  purposes here, for animatic ones.   Schaffer writes:  “In cinema,  as Deleuze argues, the automatic interval  allows   cameras  to  extract  movement  from   bodies,   even   if  it  then decentres movement by raising  to a plane  of immanence opens  to effects of false continuity. In animation, the automated interval engenders movement” (460). The animatic body—always virtual, coming  into  and  passing out  of being  without ever  inhabiting it—is produced via “a circuit  of self-affection played out  in time between human and  machine” (463).  Its production emerges from  the circuit  of hands, eyes, voices, light, camera that feed its process  of emergence. The animatic body  is divided against itself in time,  and  engendered via a machine, to now  tilt Schaffer’s perspective a bit, composed of human and  technological “parts,” functions, and rhythms.
