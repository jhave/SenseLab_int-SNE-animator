It  would be  absurd to  say,  however, that   there   are  no  longer   bodies   to  be invested.  It’s   rather  that   the   body   has   become   a  way   station  or   site   of transformation (rather than  a  final  reference point).  The  ontological questions posed by the relay  of bodies  in Intervista, along  with  Eckberg  and  Mastroianni’s nostalgic gazes,  are  replaced by the  celebrity surgery spread where tabloid speculation asks:  scalpel  or photoshop? The multiple plastic  surgeries of reality TV stars  work  to embody the animatic “pop,” to re-make it in sculpted flesh and silicone, botox and  restylane. The transformation is the story.  Heidi  Montag, with her  10-in-1  plastic   surgeries was  working to  look  like  an  ideal,   a  doll,  and succeeded in her task (though she later expressed regret  at having undertaken it). The goal of these  surgeries isn’t the one associated with  a vast majority of plastic surgery’s  popular  variants. It  isn’t  conformity, enhancement,  or  even optimization or  perfectibility. It’s  another kind  of transformation  entirely. The form-of-life that  it pertains to is different—and what  is distinctive about  the contemporary moment is that  way  the  old  form  is sliding into  the  new.   Where Sobchack  diagnosed cinema’s  coalescence with  the older  cosmetic  surgical logic, here we can see its plastic,  animatic twist.
