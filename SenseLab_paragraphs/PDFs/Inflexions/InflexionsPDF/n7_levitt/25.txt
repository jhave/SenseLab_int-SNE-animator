The  emergence of  animation as  the  dominant and  paradigmatic (or,  perhaps more  properly, diagrammatic) medium of our  time coincides with  the decisively novel   development  in  the   biological   sciences   which   opens   possibilities  for producing living  beings  as well as with  mutations in the political  dimensions of discourses and  practices around life currently framed as “biopolitics.” The coalescence of these  transformations mark  our  cultural moment:   While  these  at first might  appear as disjunct cultural fields, with  no causal  and  little conceptual relation, understanding the link between Dolly  the sheep  and  her  progeny (metaphorically speaking) and  the multimedial bodies  of Avatar is a key to understanding the time in which  we live.
