[9] Although I am focusing on animation as such here, many  of these same effects can  be achieved by live-action cinema  in an  animatic mode.  Obvious examples might  include the magical  effects of Méliès films, Ray Harryhausen’s fantastic creatures, and  a great  deal  of contemporary CGI including the  digital actors  of Lord of the Rings or The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Further, anywhere a shot comes from an “impossible” perspective—from the crane  shots  that  create  Busby Berkeley’s girl-machines to our travels into corporeal interiors in television’s CSI syndicate—the real  ceases  to be its reason and  measure and  it thus  takes  on an animatic aspect.
