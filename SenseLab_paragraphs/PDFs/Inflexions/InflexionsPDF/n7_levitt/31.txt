I want  to propose a quite  specific definition of the animatic here: The animatic is any   aspect    of   (for   our   purposes  now)    moving  image    production—from animation as such  to digital special  effects to extreme camera angles—that does not deploy the cinematic reality-effect of the index,  described above  in relation to Intervista,  as  it produces a pro-filmic real.  The  example of an  extreme camera angle is an important, complicating instance here because cinematic and  animatic modes, as I’ve argued, are  never  fully  determined by the  material technicity of the apparatus.  There’s an ethological rather than  a classificatory engine  at work here. It’s about  how images  work,  how they behave, how they interact with  other forces.  The “real”  of a photographed scene may be deformed from within, and  a large  portion of  animatic production  is  informed by  the  register of  cinematic realism.  This  definition  of  course   complicates  any   strict   boundary  between cinema  and  animation: The  two  modes consistently haunt and  transform one another.  Cinema and  the  cinematic age are traversed by the  animatic, and  vice versa,   and   this  goes  for  the  ways   in  which   the  cinematic  and   the  animatic function as cultural modalities as well.
