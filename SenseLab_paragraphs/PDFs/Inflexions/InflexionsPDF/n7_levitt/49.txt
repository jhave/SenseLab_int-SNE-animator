Valeria  Lukyanova, who  is known as the Real-Life Barbie because of her famous resemblance to the  ever-popular toy,  and  whose  videos  have  garnered millions of hits  on  youtube, spurring widespread media coverage and,  most  recently, a Vice  documentary, Space Barbie, sums   up  the  new  logic  of  the  animatic in  a response to her critics: “It’s what  success is like. I’m happy I seem unreal to them. It means  I’m doing  a good  job.” [14]
