I’m deploying this  scene  from  Intervista not  only  to introduce its themes but  to introduce an  approach to  critical  mediology that  I call  “media ethology.” My concern   is  with   the   intertwining  of  material-machinic  structures  of  image practices,  particular   dispositions   of   the   sensible,    and   the   set   of   cultural assumptions  and   epistemologies  that   emerge  to  frame   and   structure experience—to make  sense  of sense—thus producing the rhetorics and  modes of existential conditioning that  structure a dispositif.  My focus  within this  larger field,  as I’ve indicated above,  is on how  our  conceptions of “life,”  at any  given moment, are deeply informed by the mediological stratum.
