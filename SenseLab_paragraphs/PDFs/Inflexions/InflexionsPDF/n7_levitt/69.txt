Innocence is “peopled” with  various types  of beings—androids, gynoids, robots, dolls,  animals, and  humans—plotted between poles  of animate and  inanimate, living  and  dead—where no  entity  exists  at  any  of the  extremes and  all are  in- between. The  mise-en-scène of  this  sequence in  particular is  itself  a  kind   of catalogue of artificial  lives  drawn from  cinema,  literature, and  art  history—and the  marshaling of these  figures  under the  command of Oshii’s  doll  emphasizes his insistence on it as the  central  figure.  The scene  “quotes” Ridley  Scott’s 1982
Blade Runner:  a vat  of floating  eyeballs  in  Haraway’s  lab  echoes  the  Hannibal Chew  scene in which  two replicants—genetically engineered super-humans with a  four   year   life  span—look  for  their   maker   but   find   instead  the   specialist bioengineer who  makes  “just eyes.”  A gynoid stretched on a stainless steel table where an apparently specialized medical-industrial machine either  probes, assembles, or dismantles her refers  to a more  contemporary entry,  Chris Cunningham’s 2000 music  video  for Bjork’s “All is Full of Love”  in which  Bjork herself  appears as a female  android. Finally,  the  Hadaly model  gynoid itself, as well as taking  its name  from  the female  android of Villiers de l’Isle Adam’s 1886
Future Eve (Villiers 2000), resembles the uncanny photographs of dolls  produced by  German Surrealist Hans  Bellmer  in  the  1930s and  40s. Bellmer’s  dolls  are clearly  a particularly important reference for Oshii  as Bellmer’s  book,  The Doll, makes  an appearance in another scene,  and  Oshii  flew  members of his crew  to New  York  City  to  see  an  exhibit  of Bellmer  photos at  the  ICP  as  part  of the preparation for the production.
