It brings  us back to the zero-degree of the beam  of light  or the blank  page  or the white  or blue  screen  as it encounters the animatic machine. There’s  an  active  void,  and  a gesture, and  it begins.  Anything can  be erased, but  it can also always be resurrected. Cartoon style violence  is a case-in- point:  if a head  hit with  a frying  pan  assumes the shape  of a pan,  it only takes  a moment to bounce—or squash and  stretch—back to its usual proportions. This particular tradition obtains particularly in the  American cartoon, of course,  but just as time,  decay,  and  death always shadow the living  picture of the cinematic image—even where the particular content of the text would absolutely belie any and   all  of  these—in  the   same   way   the   possibility  of  metamorphosis and resurrection  always  shadow  the   animatic  image.
