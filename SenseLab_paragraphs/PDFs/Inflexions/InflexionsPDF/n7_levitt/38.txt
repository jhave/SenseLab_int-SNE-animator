The  Fleischer  Brothers’  “Koko’s  Cartoon Factory,” in which  any  character may animate or  inanimate any  other,  makes  this  same  point  by  means  of an  even more  thorough appearance-dispersion of life. [13] The cartoon opens  with  Dave Fleischer  drawing and  animating Koko the Clown.   In one segment, Koko builds a toy  soldier. The  toy  soldier comes  alive,  in  this  case  live-action-live, only  to draw and  animate other  soldiers who  come after Koko. As quickly  as they  come, Koko  erases  them  with  his  animating-and-inanimating  machine. The  animatic body  is made  from  scratch,  coming  into being  with  the line or pixel. There  is no death in  animation, only  erasure or  metamorphosis. Its play  of animation and inanimation exist  on  a continuum and  emerge from  the  feedback loop  of light, hands, technics,  voices, etc., that coordinate its production.
