To appropriate the  historic  transformations of human nature that capitalism wants to  limit  to  the  spectacle, to  link  together image and  body  in a space  where they  can  no  longer  be separated, and thus  to forge  the whatever body  whose  physis is resemblanceâ€”this is   the    good    that    humans   must    now    learn    to   wrest    from commodities in their  decline.  Advertising and  pornography, which escort the commodity to the grave  like hired  mourners, are the unknowing midwives of  this  new  body  of  humanity. (Agamben
1993: 50)
