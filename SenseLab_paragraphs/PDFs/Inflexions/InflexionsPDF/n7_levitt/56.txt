In  drawing  Donna Haraway  into   the  world  of  the  film,  Oshii   is  explicitly engaging an established contemporary academic—and popular—conversation about  technoscience, culture, and  new  forms  of individual and  political subjectivity.  [16] And  it is telling  that  Oshii  gives  us  his  own,  very  particular version,  of  Donna  Haraway.  Most   centrally  for  our   purposes  here,   where Haraway famously describes “boundary breakdowns” between machine and organism,  animal  and   human,  physical and   non-physical,  Oshii’s   Haraway contests the ontological consistency of these categories altogether, rather positing their emergence in the an-ontological dimension of the animatic.
