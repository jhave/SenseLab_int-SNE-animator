[15] The explicit history of dolls and automata that Oshii presents in the film, that is,  the  names that  come  up  in  the  film’s  dialogue (e.g.  Descartes, LaMettrie, Roussell,  etc.) as well as the special visual  reference of the dolls themselves—they clearly  echo  the  dolls  of  German surrealist photographer,  Hans   Bellmer—are mostly  drawn from a very Western cannon of art and philosophy. I am sure there is much  more  that  can be said about  the film’s less explicit  but highly  suggestive references to the history of dolls and  automata in Japanese culture, although this is  not   within  the   scope   of  the   present  commentary.  Oshii   has   some   very interesting things to say about  the “nationality of the film” which  are worth reproducing here  and  might  provide an  interesting backdrop to an  analysis of the interplay between European and Japanese sources within the film: “I grew  up reading European [literature] – mostly  The Bible – and  it wasn’t  until  recently, when I  finished making this  film,  that  I  realized I  was  really  Japanese. The culture of your  life and  the  culture of your  movie  are  two  different things, and after  completing this  movie,   I  felt  like  I  was  [definitively]  Japanese, but  the elements in the  film,  if you  have  to put  a finger  on  them,  were  probably more European  than    American,  and    more   European  than    Japanese.  For   those filmmakers who originally came from Europe or Hong  Kong or other  parts  of the world and  made  it in Hollywood, their  nationalities may  have  been  something other   than   that   of  the  U.S.,  but   the  nationality  of  their   films  are  definitely
