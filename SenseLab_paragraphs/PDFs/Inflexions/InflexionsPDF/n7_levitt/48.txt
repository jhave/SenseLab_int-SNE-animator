in the broad scope  of human history, this  hyperdrive-animatic version of reproduction (the exact number of embryos transferred in the case of the octuplet birth    has   never    been   publicly  released)  is   of   course    dependent  on   the combination of novel  biotechnological possibilities and  a novel  (and  apparently not  entirely idiosyncratic) understanding  of family  planning. The  discourse of “ethical  failure” in the popular response to these  examples continues to vacillate between a valorization of the  “natural” “god-or-nature intended” body  and  a denigration  of  the  grotesque.  It  explicitly   advocates  a  return  to  a  body-as- reference, a body  grounded either  in  nature and  biology  (these  are  sometimes more  or  less  interchangeable concepts in  this  context)  or  in  theology.   Putting aside  whether or not the ethical  disgust is warranted, it lacks critical  force in the face of the animatic logic that subtends both the pop  cultural and  biomedical operations  here,   as   both   eschew,   to   use   Franklin  and   Lock’s   terms,   both “genealogy” and  “the  grid  of a  single,  unified system”—that is,  all  attributes which  could  provide ontological ballast  and  stability for these  notions of theologically or biologically essential lives  and  bodies—in favor  of technologies “of doing,  building, and engineering” (14).
