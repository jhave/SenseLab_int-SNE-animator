Here, Batou is channeling Haraway’s earlier  assertion that the difference between humans and  machines is  merely an  article  of faith  through a  commonly told story  of Descartes in  which  he  loses  his  young daughter and  builds a  doll— typically, she  is rather described as an  “automaton”—which fully  assumes her place in his affections.  This already draws us out of the usual orbit of the cyborg. First,  it  shifts  the  historical dimension  of  the  argument about   the  exchanges between organisms and  machines; the questions posed by the fate of the Hadaly are  referred back  at least  as far as the  seventeenth century. This isn’t merely in the service of pointing out, however, that we have always been cyborgs,  technical beings  who  from  our  very  beginning have  relied  on clothing and  buildings, fire and  art, to sustain our  bodies  and  cultures (though this is no doubt true,  as well as an important part  of the film’s worldview). More  notably and  more originally—and this is the second essential point  here—it  displaces the figure  of the  cyborg  with  that  of the  doll.  The slippage from  automaton to doll  occurs  in the story  of Descartes itself, and  is then  reinforced by the surrounding dialogue about  child-rearing and artificial  life. [18]
