In  the  first  passage  above   Agamben asserts   that   ethics  is  made   possible,  is opened, by humansâ€™ lack of any essence  or destiny. If humans had  an essence  or destiny, he explains, it would only be a matter of figuring out what  tasks need  to be  done   in  order to  accomplish  it,  and   there   would be  no  need   for  ethical questioning or, as Agamben has  it, ethical  experience, at all. The flipside of this formulation is also true for Agamben: where humans perceive their experience in terms  of a particular biological  destiny or spiritual vocation, the sphere of ethics is occluded.
