Because   I  undertake an  analysis  of  Oshii’s  aesthetics  elsewhere,  and   in  the interest of time, I’ll only give the most schematic indication of how Oshii deploys these  possibilities. The  composition of  the  Coroner Haraway  scene—from its figures  to  its  color  palette to  its  rhythms—1) displaces the  human figure  as  a primary site for spectatorial identification—and as a unifying feature of the landscape and  movement of the  work.  The film as a whole  is a hybrid of hand drawn animation and  CGI and  the  backgrounds are  often  computer rendered, and almost  hyperreal in their textural detail,  while the hand drawn characters are at  times  so  schematic they  verge  on  the  hieratic, even  abstract. This  tends   to repel—or  at  least  destabilize—the tendency toward  identification, as  well  as using  visual  detail  and  intensity to reverse the conventional primacy of the living body.  2) The  hand-drawn images  disrupt the  coherence of the  CGI universe—
