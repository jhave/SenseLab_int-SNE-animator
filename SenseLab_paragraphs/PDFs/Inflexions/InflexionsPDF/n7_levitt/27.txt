strawberry, or to patent genetic  markers using  fluorescent proteins from  deep- sea creatures transforms biology  from  the  study of natural history into  a set of interventions or techniques” (Franklin and  Locke 2003: 14). [7] We can see in Franklin and  Locke’s  description of  the  new  biosciences a  shift  from representation to production.  While we saw forms  of engineering also as central to  Marey’s  images  and  prescriptions of the  19th  century, this  engineering took place on a different stratum and  was based  on representations of its fundamental category:  the   animal,  and   even   more   typically,  the   human  animal,  body. Although he was no doubt a forward-looking and  transitional figure  in the development of the disciplines of physiology and  biology,  it’s interesting to note that  Marey  occupied the Chair  of the Natural History of Organized Bodies at the College de France.  The current practices Franklin and Locke describe don’t begin with   a   massy    anatomical  organism  but   with   biological    bits,   material  or informatic, and  these may be exchanged and  recombined. Contrary to pursuing a classificatory logic, these  practices eschew  category in favor  of novelty and  the production of forms  of life.  And  even  where Marey’s images  dove  down below the  full body  of the  organism—he developed a technique of graphic inscription which  led to his invention of the cardiograph (with August Chaveau in 1865), the pneumograph for respiration, and  the myograph for nerve  and  muscle  action—it was in the interest of imaging the mobility of what  could  hitherto only be viewed in immobility. His goal, that is, was to image  what  he described as “the functions of life, that  is to say the  play  of the  organs which  anatomy has  disclosed to us” (280). [8] Life was  a key  term  for Marey,  and  it is precisely this version of life— developed in Marey’s physiology lab and  becoming-spectral in the films that  the Lumières brothers and  Georges  Méliès  would make  just a few years  later—that Franklin and  Locke  suggest no  longer  possesses the  requisite stability be  the subject  of representation, no longer  may  act as referent in the  sense  that  Marey deploys it here.
