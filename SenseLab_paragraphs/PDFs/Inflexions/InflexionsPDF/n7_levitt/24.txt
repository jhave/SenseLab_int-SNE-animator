Today,  the  horizon of possibilities of simulation in both  art  and  science—from cartoons per  se and  the animatic effects of CGI to various dreamt and  incarnate potentials of biocybernetics—are shifting the reigning cultural paradigms of life in significant ways,  moving away  from questions (and  broad-scale cultural assumptions) about  ontology, category, and  being, to ones of appearance, metamorphosis, gesture, and  affect. We can see this shift in 1) transformations of biopolitics that  occur around the indetermination of its prefix, that  is, around the status and  structure of the conception of life that  has grounded modern political discourses  and   practices  and   2)  in  what   I’ll  describe  as  a  displacement  of cinema’s  already fraught reality-function. 3) Finally,  as I’ve suggested, from cinema’s  ontological crisis we move into the domain of animation’s an-ontology.
