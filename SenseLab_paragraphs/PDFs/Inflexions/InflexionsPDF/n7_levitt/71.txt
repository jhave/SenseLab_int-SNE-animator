human machine) loves  his  progeny—biological and  mechanical—equivalently. The figure  of the child  has been precious to humanist narratives, bundling a teleological narrative of biological  development, and  notions of genealogy and family,  heredity and  descent, into  one  compact ideological package, neatly  tied up with  connotations of innocence and  imagination.  We can see the resonance— and  imbrication—of the image  of the child  with  Franklin and  Lock’s description of an older  model  of “life itself”  in Remaking Life & Death which  refers  us “to the unity  of all living  things through the  model  of common ancestry and  descent” (14).  That  the  “child”  is  a  conceptual product  of  the  aesthetic  and   cultural ideologies of the Romantic and  Victorian eras is often  occluded by this powerful cultural narrative. Seeing  the  doll  as  an  artifact   of  childhood  reinforces this forgetting. But if we draw out  Haraway’s logic we can flip this  scenario, so that rather than  the  doll  being  an accessory of the  child,  the  child  is an accessory of the doll—an artifact  of the modes of determining the nature of life, the relation of animate to  inanimate, of play  to  reality  that  the  tropes of both  child  and  doll figure.  What  we find, alongside the dismantling of biological,  developmental genealogy,  is  a  life-become-animatic  whose   theoretical  coordinates  are  very similar  to those  we saw in “Koko’s Cartoon Factory,” despite the vast contextual differences between the two works.
