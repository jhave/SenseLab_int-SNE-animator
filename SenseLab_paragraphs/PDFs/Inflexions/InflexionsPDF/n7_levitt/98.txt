What  remains to be accounted for, particularly as we leave Agamben’s notion of the “Idea” of resemblance behind, is how  then  something like resemblance—and at least the appearance of identity—persist within the animatic apparatus.  Or, to frame  this  in another way,  how  we  conceive  the  very  limits  and  resistances to metamorphic   flexibility—as well   as  actual   and   potential  misuses  of  it.  My contention is  that  we  need   to  think   these  questions too  from  within the  an- ontological field of the contemporary dispositif.  This is the case precisely because, as I’ve argued, other  means—whether they  refer us to the destiny or vocation of a biological  body  or  a return to the  real,  or  vacillate  in the  tabloid-dialectic of enthralled fascination and ethical disgust and censure—have lost all critical force. The concept  of an-ontology provides us with  a new power for thinking the forms of  life  emerging in  the  animatic regime. It  also  allows   us  to  reconsider the functions of the simulacrum in relation to our current coordinates. I want  to close
