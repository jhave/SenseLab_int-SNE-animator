[18] Daniel  Tiffany  points us to the  manner in which  this  slippage is in fact an index  of  a  particular modern concern   with  the  status of  the  image,  one  that begins  with  Kleist and  wends its way through the works  of E.T.A. Hoffmann, the Surrealists, and  others.  He writes,  “Although many  questions arise about  the displacement of the classical  automaton by the doll, it is apparent in the texts of Kleist and  others that  this transaction pertains to the demechanization of the automaton, in a manner that,  paradoxically, only  enhances the autonomy of the device  as a simulacrum.  That  is to say,  it pertains to an  evolving ontology of pictures in modern culture and  to the enduring interdependence of pictures and bodies.” Toy Medium:  Materialism and Modern Lyric.
