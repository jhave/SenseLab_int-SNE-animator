We can see clearly  here  where the  cultural logic of animatic life figured by the doll   dovetails  with    the   medio-logic  of   animation:  it   doesnâ€™t    begin   with genealogical succession (or a profilmic real) but with  a blank  page  or blue screen or beam  of light, as these  encounter the animatic machine and  unfold into a play of gestures and  metamorphoses. If the blank  page/blue screen/beam of light are signals   of  animatic potentiality,  this  must   always encounter  and   engage the particular limits  of the  circuit  by which  it is engaged, as I will  explain in more detail  below,  as well as whatever repetition compulsions this circuit includes and plays  out. The limiting factors and  repetitions can take different forms: one of the possibilities moving image  animation deploys most  often  involves reproducing the  cinematic  reality-effect via  animatic means.   In  certain   instances, this  may
