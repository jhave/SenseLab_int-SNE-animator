appears to resemble, only “produces an effect of resemblance” (49). But this effect is “wholly external, and  produced by entirely different means  from those that are at work  in the  model.” (49) We can say then  that  the  simulacrum is already an an-ontological figure  as it not tethered to a grounding model. As Michael  Camille so succinctly explains, the  simulacrum is “based upon the  premise that  images do  not  so much  replicate the  real  or substitute for it but  rather are  encounters with another order of reality  entirely.” [11] We need,  though, to take this one step further: the  simulacrum is an  encounter with  another order, but  we  may  not want  to call it another order of reality.  The direction in which  Deleuze’s phantasmatic simulacrum is pointing us, as it illuminates the animatic apparatus, is  toward a  domain in  which   images—even where  they  explicitly   play  with forms   of  representation of  all  kinds—have left  the  realm   in  which   a  reality principle  holds   sway.   The  simulacrum  is  not,   of  course,   new—and  nor   is animation and  the animatic. What  is novel  today is the dominance of animatic as a set of cultural forces, the shift of animation from  a minor to a major  form,  and I’m using  animation here—particularly at moments where it thematizes its own conditions of production—to crystallize the operations of this much  larger  field. We   can   read    Brian   Massumi’s  comments   on   the   simulacrum  as   also   a commentary on the animatic, one that  steers  us back toward its mediological life: “The resemblance of the simulacrum is a means,  not an end . . .  Resemblance is a beginning masking the advent of whole  new vital dimension.” (Massumi 1987: 2) [12]
