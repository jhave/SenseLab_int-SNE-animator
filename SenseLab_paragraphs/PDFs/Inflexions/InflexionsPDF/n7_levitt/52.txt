and  formal  elements, and  between the  affective  and  conceptual dimensions of the modes of spectatorship that it conjures. It engages the deep  structural logic of animation and  also  reaches  out  to  reveal  how  the  logic  of the  animatic works today, that  is, how it is emerges in and  as regimes of aesthetics, ethics, and metaphysics. Its virtuosity doesn’t  make  it easy  to read  or to discuss, however. Where   Duck  Amuck  gave  us  a  streamlined  7-minute version of  animatic an- ontology in the familiar fancy of the Warner Brothers  universe, Innocence scatters and  proliferates its own  auto-theoretical investigations across  a 100 minutes of a complex plot involving an investigation of murders committed by a new breed  of sophisticated sex robots  run  amuck and  a philosophical dialogue on artificial  life that  refers  to or directly quotes Descartes, La Mettrie,  Kleist, Freud, and  Villiers de L’Isle Adam, among others.  [15] The very cultural conditions of possibility for the  production of such  a work—that is, of a deeply philosophical manifesto on contemporary mediology in the form of a hybrid drawn and  computer generated animated  narrative—themselves  point   to  a  number  of  features  of  animatic culture including its global  dimensions and  the way  it thinks its own  technicity. Here,  I’m using  a single  scene  from  the work  as a kind  of machine for thinking the still-emergent properties of the animatic, along with some of their ramifications.
