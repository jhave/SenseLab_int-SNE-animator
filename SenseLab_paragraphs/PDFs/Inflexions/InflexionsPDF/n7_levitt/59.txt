Oshii  helps  us to re-think the  features of Haraway’s cyborg  in three  new  ways: by stretching Haraway’s confusions of ontological boundaries into  the an- ontological dimension of the  animatic, by  encouraging us  to  think  the contemporary techno-logic of the cyborg  through a surprisingly untimely frame of reference: the  doll,  and  by placing this  thought of animatic an-ontology in its constitutive relation to the affective dimension of animatic aesthetics.
