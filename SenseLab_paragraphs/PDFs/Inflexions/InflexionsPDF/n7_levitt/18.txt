All  of  these   dimensions  of  cinema—scientific,  aesthetic, cultural—were very clearly  framed in relation to rhetorics of life. In 1895, the first cinema  cameras— the U.S. Vitascope, the German Bioscope,  and  the English  Animatograph—were produced and  patented almost  simultaneously.  Following in the  footsteps of a protocinematic  optical   device   called   the   zoetrope,  the   names  of  these   new inventions make  a  powerful claim:  The  cinema   will  capture, or  produce,  life itself.  Just  one  year  later,  the  English  version of a program that  accompanies a screening of the  Lumières brothers films  proclaims: “The  interval during which one picture is substituted for a succeeding one is so infinitesimal that,  the retina of the  eye  preserving one  image  until  the  next  one  takes  its place,  an  effect  of absolute continuity and  perfect  illusion of life is obtained” (Cholodenko 2000:
20). In  cinema’s  early  years,  it was  often  referred to  as  living  photography in popular parlance. In 1926, Terry Ramsaye writes  that the cinema  is “like the tree, clearly  an organism, following organic law in its development,” while  numerous other   commentators reflect  on  cinema’s   uncanny ability  to  revivify   the  dead (Ramsaye:  xxxviii).
