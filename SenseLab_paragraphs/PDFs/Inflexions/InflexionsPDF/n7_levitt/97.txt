hand and  the  wide  variety of animatic-spectacular forms  of commodity on  the other,  it hardly seems  that  the  commodity is in decline.  And  if advertising and pornography are “unknowing midwives of this new body  of humanity,” it is in a different manner, I would suggest, than  the  one  Agamben has  in  mind here. First, in the space of the animatic apparatus, in which  we find Oshii’s decentering of the  human figure  arising  alongside “transgenic sheep  with  human DNA,”  a fish  crossed with  a strawberry, and  the  doll-bodies of metamorphic celebrities, it’s not clear that  the new bodies  of the animatic are precisely human ones. What I want  to retain  from  Agamben’s formulations here  is the  manner in which  we may  articulate the  particular conception of ethics  he develops as the  default of essence,   vocation,  and   telos—and  its  corollary  potentiality—with  the contemporary phase of what  Agamben calls (after Debord, of course)  the society of the spectacle and  what  I’m calling  the animatic apparatus.  If it is the case that ethics—like  the  however bodies   of  the  animatic apparatus—don’t  refer  to  a biological  or theological ground or telos, than  that opens  a space to consider their forms  of production and  metamorphosis along  new  lines,  that  is, in relation to the how? of their unfolding.
