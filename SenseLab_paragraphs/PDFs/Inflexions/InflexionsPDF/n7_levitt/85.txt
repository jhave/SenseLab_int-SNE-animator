on us to think  differently—about aesthetics, about  politics,  and  about  ethics? Animation’s an-ontology also suggests a kind  of dispersion and  virtualization of life—its status as mutable, in transformation, open  to its outside--as what  in fact subtends  the  persistence  of  life  as  both   the  political   object  par excellence, in debates around abortion and  stem cells, to name  some of its lightening rod incarnations, and  as the  goal  of production, where what  is produced now  are, first  and  foremost, forms  and  modes of  life,  either   literally or  as  triggers of affective  modulation produced by the spectacle-commodity form.  I wonder, too, in this  scenario which  conjures almost  the  opposite of what  we’d  traditionally take  to be the conditions for ethical  thought, where can we find  a possibility for ethics?  If ethics  has been  thought in terms  of finitude, the particular ontology of human being,  and  being-towards-death,  and—finally—if at least one powerfully operational cultural notion of life no longer  functions in relation to these fundamental limiting, ethical  denominations, where does this scenario open  onto its own  immanent critique, its own  positive possibility? There  seem  to me to be two  possible directions  here,  back  toward  possibility, limit,  and  the  real—or further into the virtualization of life.  In the space  opened by the latter,  there  can still   be   ethical   thought,  but   it  would  have   to   be   configured  not   around ontological  commitments,  and   its  questions  of  who?   and   what?,   but   rather around the embrace of the one an-ontological determinant: how?
