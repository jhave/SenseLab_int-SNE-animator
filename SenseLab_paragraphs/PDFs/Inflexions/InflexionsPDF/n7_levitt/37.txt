we rather discover Bugs Bunny,  sitting  at a drawing table with  the Daffy cartoon lain upon it—”Ain’t  I a stinker?” he says in his characteristic drawl, casting  this ontological deconstruction  into  the  abyss,  that  is, enacting it as a mise-en-abime, and  insisting that  behind a cartoon is always another cartoon. My  contention here  is that  what  Duck Amuck stages  is the an-ontological nature of animation as a medium. Rendering enters  an infinite  regress. Of course,  this cartoon has a very specific cultural location  in the America of the 50s—in this case the object it needs most   to  deconstruct  to  reveal   its  an-ontology  is  the   animal  character  that provides its  typical   anchoring—but  it  also  enacts   what   I’m  arguing are  the essential characteristics of the medium itself.
