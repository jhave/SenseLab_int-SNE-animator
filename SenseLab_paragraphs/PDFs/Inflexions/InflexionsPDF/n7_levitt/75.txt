and  vice versa.   Different key animators are employed in different sequences as if to emphasize the idiosyncrasies of the artist’s hand. 3) As is quite  common in the film as a whole,  the Coroner Haraway scene foregrounds a disorientation of conventional tropes of the lively  and  the inert.  It opens  with  a vertical  pan  up  a body-bagged, part-deconstructed, female  android. The texture of the bag’s plastic—a  rich   yellow,   viscous   and   rippling—will  contrast  with   the   white, blanched, almost  over-exposed look of the lab, as well as with  the flatness  of its human figures.   Against  the  mostly   pale,  almost   2-dimensional scene,  a  few artifacts  will stand out because of the intensity of their  color or the detail  of their texture, the “body bags” just described; the red lips, green  eyes, and red and gold interiors of the  Hadaly gynoids; and,  most  consistently of all, the  warm, bright orange scrolling   text  and  images   of  the  lab’s  multiple computer  displays. 4) While anime’s  limited animation may  have  initially  been developed as a stylistic adaptation to lower  budgets, Oshii makes  its out-of-joint temporality into a philosophy of slowness, opening empty, contemplative moments in the film. The image  rests  on Togusa’s  face for so many  seconds we feel we’re looking  at a still or hanging in a suspended animation, until  Togusa  finally,  surprisingly, blinks. Time moves,  halts,  and  then  jerks back into  motion. 5) Each character—and this includes objects—exists  in its own  time-and-space zone.  The pace  of characters walking and  cloud  movement are  out  of sync,  or  the  relative scales  of objects would be impossible in “real”  space  and  time. 6) Oshii tends  away  from human- centered perception, preferring extreme tilts  and  pans  and  eschewing eye-line matches.
