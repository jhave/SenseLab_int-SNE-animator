made  27 years  earlier.  In La Dolce Vita, now  a film within a film, these  two  play almost  impossibly beautiful people—she, a statuesque and  voluptuous blonde, he, tall, dark  and  handsome in an  impeccably tailored mod  suit—who are  also paragons  of  the  exploding  global   media  spectacle circa  1960—an  American screen goddess and  a celebrity gossip  writer. (Marcello’s colleague and  sometime side-kick  in   the   film,   Paparrazzo,  will   lend    his   name    to   the   emerging “profession”).  In the sequence they  watch,  a now  hyper-iconic scene shot  in the Trevi  fountain in  Rome,  they  dance,  talk,  and  kiss  as  dawn breaks.  Watching these  spectral images  of their  youthful selves,  Marcello  wistfully tilts  his  head; Anita  wipes  a tear from the corner  of her eye—carefully, so as not to smudge her elaborate make-up.
