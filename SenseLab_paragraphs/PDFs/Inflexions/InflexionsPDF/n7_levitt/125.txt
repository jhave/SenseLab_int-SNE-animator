[22] One of the Innocence’s most interesting contributions to the concept  of the animatic apparatus is its positioning of it in relation to a history of the quest  for artificial  life—a history of dolls,  puppets, automata and  replicants—rather than in relation to a history of visual  representation. A number of film theorists have made  related suggestions: one could  actually delineate a literature on the topic of cinema’s  historical relation to  automata. Animation theorist Alan  Cholodenko makes   this  genealogical  claim  in  a  very  direct   way,  suggesting that  we  put animators “in the  line that  extends from  Mary  Shelley,  Victor  Frankenstein and his   creation,  back   to  Jacquet   Droz   and   his   automata,  and   beyond,  to  de Vaucanson, and  back to the Alexandrian school and  Prometheus, Pygmalion, Daedalus, and  Hephestus . . . “ (Illusion of Life 2, 495).  In The Animatic Apparatus: Biocybernetic Reproduction and the Futures  of the Image, I  analyze this  animatic genealogy in more  specific terms,  dividing it into a tradition of copies and  one of simulacra.
