The dancing body,  appearing in its materiality – with  different parts  of the body, or   ‘particles’,   as  Deleuze would  say,   acting   together  while   simultaneously stretching away  from  each  other  – is positioned at a chiasmic  meeting point,  “a complex relation between differential velocities” (Deleuze 1988, 123), between the inside  and  the outside. When  Deleuze writes  about  “a composition of speeds and  slownesses on a plane  of immanence” (1988, 123), he is not only referring to a Spinozan understanding of the body,  but to life as a way of taking  up or laying down rhythms.  Understood this way,  the somagram of the dancing body  relates not only to the apparent rhythmic movements of the body  but also to a life in its heterogenetic singularity: the somagram has to be (re)drawn again.
