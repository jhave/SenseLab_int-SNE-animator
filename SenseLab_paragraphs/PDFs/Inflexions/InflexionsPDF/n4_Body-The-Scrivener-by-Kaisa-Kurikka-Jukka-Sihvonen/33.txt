In Deep, the somagram seems  to indicate a tension between various doubles. The doubles-couple of actuality and  virtuality can  be seen  on  the  metamorphosing body  of the  dancer that  appears as a human, as an animal (worm, lizard, bird, cat,  etc.),  as  a  flower,   and   in  a  state-in-between  them.     This  monstrous  or ghostlike quality underlines the  body  as extending beyond ‘the human regime’ and  even  into  a  transhuman(ist) understanding  of  physical expression.   Here dancing is not limited to an expression of an intentional human mind.  Rather,  it searches for its expression not  just from  the  flora  and  fauna  of nature but  from the  language of machines as well.   In fact,  as we  have  argued, the  somagram, here   understood  as  a  form   of  expression,  solely   depends  on  (audiovisual) machines.   In other  words, the transhuman(ist) nature of the mutating body positions it  paradoxically and  simultaneously as  post-  and  pre-human in  the broad sense  of  not  focusing on  the  skills  of  a  human body   to  perform and represent animals or plants, for example.  Instead the idea  is to present dance  as an expression of sensation.
