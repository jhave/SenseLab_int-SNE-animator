“Behind thoughts  and  feelings,  my  brother,” wrote   Nietzsche in “The  Despisers of the  Body”  in Thus Spoke Zarathustra, “there is a might  lord,  an unknown sage  – it is called  Self; it dwelleth in thy body,  it is thy  body.”  But when we  represent the  body,  we  must transmute   our    dwelling   into    a    ghost-ridden,   ghost-written language. Soma must  become  a somagram (1985, 67).
