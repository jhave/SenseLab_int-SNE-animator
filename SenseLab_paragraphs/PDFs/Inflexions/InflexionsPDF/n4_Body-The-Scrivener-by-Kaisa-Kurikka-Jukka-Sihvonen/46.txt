In this way  the somagram comes  close to how  Deleuze writes  on the diagram in The  Logic of  Sensation,  a  study  on  Francis   Bacon’s  paintings.    According  to Deleuze, diagrams consist  of  manual traits  that  are  nonrepresentative, nonillustrative, nonnarrative, they  are  a-siginifying traits:  “This  is what  Bacon calls  a  ‘graph’  or  a  diagram: it  is  as  if  a  Sahara,   a  zone  of  the  Sahara,   were suddenly inserted into  the  head;  it is as  if a piece  of rhinoceros skin,  viewed under  a  microscope,  were   stretched  over   it”   (2003,  100).     Like  diagrams, somagrams are ‘manual traits’ in their  visible  materiality, but  their  visibility has to be produced. Yet, as such, the somagram emerges as an impersonal face of the biogram.   This  impersonality is the  hand that  throws us  back  from  where we began:  the ‘not particular’ Bartleby  at sleep and  dreaming in front of a white  wall whereas the narrator is faced with  but ‘confused sensations’: “It is as if the hand assumed an  independence  and   began   to  be  guided by  other   forces,  making marks that  no longer  depend on either  our will or our sight”  (Deleuze 2003, 100–
101).
