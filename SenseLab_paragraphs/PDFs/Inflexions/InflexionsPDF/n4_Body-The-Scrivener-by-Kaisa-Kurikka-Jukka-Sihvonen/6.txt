The last encounter between the attorney and  Bartleby  in Herman Melville’s short story  ‘Bartleby, the Scrivener’ (1853) – as described by the attorney – takes  place in the  following way:  “I paused; then  went  close up  to him;  stooped over,  and saw that  his dim  eyes were  open;  otherwise he seemed profoundly sleeping. Something prompted me to touch  him. I felt his hand, when a tingling shiver  ran up my arm and down my spine  to my feet” (Melville,  2007: 38).
