Aaltokoski's brilliant movement is ungraceful, grotesque but  soft,  and  flows  in changing rhythms.   By taking  off his  shirt  and  thus  exposing his  upper body, Aaltokoski lets  the  spectator see under his  skin,  even  inside  his  muscles.  This echoes  the  way  in  which  Deleuze writes  about  the  ‘acrobatics  of the  flesh’  in Francis  Bacon’s paintings: “Well  beyond the apparent sadism, the bones  are like a trapeze apparatus (the carcass)  upon which  the flesh is the acrobat” (2003, 23). The  acrobatic yet  tiny  movements  achieved by  the  co-operation between the shoulder blades  and  muscles make  visible  the  way  in which  the  surface  of the body  becomes  a kind  of ultrasound image  as a recording of echoes  that  come from far away  in the past.
