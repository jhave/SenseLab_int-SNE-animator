(2) The  second connection refers  to  the  work  of an  American psychotherapist Stanley  Keleman who  originated the “How” exercise  as a method for emotional re-education in his  Somatic  Therapy, a variation of the  well-known Alexander technique.  With  the  general aim  to reconnect mind to body,  it is based  on  the volitional ability  of the  brain  to modify muscle  tension and  emotional gestures. The  “How” exercise  is simply a practice of self-exploration and  self-knowing. The idea  is to learn  how  to use, or organize, the self in a given  situation.  In the “How” exercise  we  learn  to  manage ourselves through the  dialogue between brain  and  muscle.   It is based  on five steps  explored and  exemplified here  with the management of depression and panic.
