directly to  a  particular way  of  understanding the  body.    According to  Bruce Baugh,   following  Gilles  Deleuze  and   Félix  Guattari,  a  body   is  ‘an  intensive reality’:  “A  body  is not  defined by  either  simple  materiality, by  its  occupying space  (’extension’),  or by organic structure.  It is defined by the  relations of its parts   (relations of  relative motion and  rest,  speed and  slowness), and  by  its actions  and  reactions with  respect both  to its environment or  milieu  and  to its internal milieu” (Baugh 2005, 31).
