In the wake  of Gins and  Arakawa’s co-signed “kick-off  assertion” (which  cruises the  middle  distance between a  sports metaphor and  a  lethal,  bucket-kicking image),   at  least   four   linguistic  layers   and   languages  become   entangled:  1) colloquial English  (“here,  then,”  “kick-off”);  2) formal,  Latin-based English (“assertion,” “primary responsibility”; 3) Latin,  with  and  without English interferences (terra fairly ferma); 4) French,  with  the uses of “to arrive” in various syntactic guises  (to arrive  as/to arrive  at/to arrive  at having).
