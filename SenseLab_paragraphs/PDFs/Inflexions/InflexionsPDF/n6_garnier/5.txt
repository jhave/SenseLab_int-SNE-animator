Made...   line?    An  unregistered  “made-line” or  “becoming-line”  waves   from within a name  which  should, in all correctness, be left alone,  unconstrained by the pressure to mean  or make sense. What if, nevertheless, something in or out of a name  insisted on making itself heard, or happened to click into place  or into a “fiction  of place”,  twice? [2] Although “calling” names is under ban, some names will  call, emit,  or initiate an arc. Gins! Of all names, this  one  seems  to agree  to make  an about-face and  to send,  in the  process,  a reversible s-i-g-n  – a starting name.   -Ings   or   Gins?   An   engineful  construction,  an   articulate(d),  mobile, motorized part  in an  “abstract machine” ready to overlap with  other  “abstract machines” or “bioscleaves,” with  a gerund here  and  a sibilant there,  and  not  a trace  of that  ancient, cumbersome, ontological particle “be.”  As if the  weight of “to be” had at long last been lifted off the shoulders of what  “begins.”
