A phase change seems  to affect the later  writings of Derrida, particularly in the last book  published in his lifetime,  The Animal That Therefore I Am  (L’Animal que donc je suis) – one in which  the  figure  of Deleuze is quoted briefly  among other dear  departed, “close and  present friends” (Derrida 2008: 23). Derrida’s last book is  about   finding  “another  logic  of  the  limit,”   a  transgressive  experience  of adjacency or of what  Derrida calls the “limitrophe”: “what abuts  onto  limits  but also what  feeds,  is fed, is cared  for, raised  and  trained, what  is cultivated on the edges  of a limit.”  Relying  on the  Greek  appendix of a hybridized word (trepho, trophos,   related  to   feeding,   nursing,   breeding,   in   Greek)    Derrida   adds: “Everything  I’ll  say  will  consist,   certainly  not   in  effacing   the   limit,   but   in multiplying its figures,  in complicating, thickening, de-linearizing, folding and dividing the  line  precisely by  making it increase  and  multiply. Moreover, the supposed first or literal  sense of trepho is just that: to transform by thickening, for example in curdling milk” (Derrida 2008: 29).
