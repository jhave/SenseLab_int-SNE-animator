Keller is  German for  cellar,  a  word based  on  the  original architecture of beer cellars  composed of juxtaposed cells, small  compartments or “celliers” in French. If  one   insists   on   treading  unauthorized  nominal  ground,  Keller-the-name articulates a dark  space,  an underground cellar  of deafblindness, to the  cellular poetics  of a writing which  follows  a transversal trajectory and  seeks  to connect one cell to the next, one site to its neighbours. As KorA, which  possibly translates a Greek  chora, Helen Keller or Arakawa seems  malleably programmed – endowed with  a capacity for capaciousness, for accommodating incompossible philosophic languages. Khora, the  Greek  word for  place  (found in  Plato’s  Timaeus) is what Gins’s  title  comes  down to,  by  macaronic anagram,  once  reduced to  its  bare initials  – a paradoxical reduction or rescaling which  rubs  elbows  with  unlimited expansiveness, and activates another form of translation.
