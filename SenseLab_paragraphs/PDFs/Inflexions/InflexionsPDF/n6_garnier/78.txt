Helen Keller or Arakawa is “inside out”  a translating book: a book  both  in and  on translation, a reversible medium or assemblage involving literal  trans-lation: displacements at top speed, hurled on the “sleigh” of “transleightion” whenever some  line invites  itself, shifting into  the supra-linear, rhizoming mode.  A snail’s pace, however, usually prevails.
