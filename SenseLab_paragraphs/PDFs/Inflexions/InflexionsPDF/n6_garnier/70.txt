No  literal  correspondence, in other  words, can  be traced  – only  what  could  be called  a form  of chorespondence between texts  signaling to  each  other  on  either side  of a divide – a divide named, on one side,  chora, and  KorA on the  other.  A quick  search  for possible ways  of translating or adapting Plato’s (and  Derrida’s) “chora” into  Gins  and  Arakawa terms  would yield  an entire  map  of connectible notions such as “waiting texture” or “landing site.” A “chora” somehow beckons, pre-translated or as-if automatically translated, in the generative, choric letters  of KorA.
