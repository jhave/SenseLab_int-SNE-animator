Helen  Keller or Arakawa  as  KorA  for  short   thrives  on  a  borderland between languages – not only by incorporating foreign  idioms ranging from Old Saxon to Sanskrit and  Japanese, but also by proceeding as a multiplier, a generator of non- linear,  diagrammatic formations and  chance  encounters. Its  anagrammed core places  it on  a collision  course  with  a Greek  (false)  twin  or look-alike, the  term “Chora,” a paradigm approached through a series  of metaphors from  Plato  to Derrida and  Kristeva, and  recently explored by  Gregory L. Ulmer.  In  Timaeus Plato  adds a third kind  of nature at the  origin  of creation, besides eternal ideas and   their   copies,   a  nature  identified as  “space”  or  as  a  “receptacle”  whose character according to Derrida is “one  of the  least  understood, most  puzzling, most resistant to interpretation.” Chora appears in Plato’s description as a strange sieve  or winnowing basket,  both  active  and  passive, which,  when receiving the elements of creation “swaying unevenly hither and  thither, was shaken by them, and by its motion again  shook  them” (Timaeus 52d-53a).
