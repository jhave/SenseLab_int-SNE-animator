Touching names, proper names, is one  of the  blind  spots  of translation, which posits  the  untranslatability and  the  untouchability of the  proper name.  A name remains proper on condition that it is untouched. Two names here have ceased  to behave as insulators, as if, to use a term  from contemporary physics, a quenching effect had  affected  their  status and  brought about  a sudden change of behavior: a qu-enching or  k-enching. The  salient   /k/’s  that  run   from  “Helen Keller”  to “Arakawa”  and   back   recode    gender  and   geopolitical  divides  into   quasi- equations,  in   which   woman  or   man,   East   or   West,   disability  and   hyper- perceptivity, two  (name+surname) and  one,  [e]’s and  [a]’s change places  or do- se-do without loss.
