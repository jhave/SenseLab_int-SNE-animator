new   “landing  sites,”   zones   of   stumbling  progression  and   stammered  or “curdling” enunciation. Helen Keller or Arakawa resurrects, for example, the word inspissation (Gins  and  Arakawa 1994: 204), imported from  the  Latin  “spissus” (thick), akin  to the French  épais – in order to welcome “the  thickness central  to a sensibility.” Curdling or coalescing might  aptly  describe many  lexical accretions or semi-solid, liquid-glass formations such  as Gins and  Arakawa’s “bioscleave,” “organism that  persons,” “reversible destiny” or  “elementary  biotopology.” A thickening  factor   intervenes  whenever  the   body   acts   as  a  body-double  to language  and   shadows  it  or  gum-shoes  it,  as  it  were:   whenever  “or,”   for example, sits ambiguously halfway between a logical particle or discursive hinge and  a body-related part: the mouth (os, oris, in Latin, as in orifice and  oratory). At its most apparently abstract, such a language is at its most concrete.  The concrete is  what   literally “grows”  together,  forming a  concrescence  or  coalescence  of mouths and  receiving/emitting ends,  an overriding of the “author” function by the reader/translator/”reador” function.
