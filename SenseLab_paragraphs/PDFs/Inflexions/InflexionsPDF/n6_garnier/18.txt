(in the palindromic “eve”  with  which  the word begins)  and  as a general eraser  of temporal boundaries. What  time  is it when the  book  begins?  What  date  is it (a question  left  gaping  by  the   second  paragraph  in  which   the   birth   dates   of Madeline Gins,  Helen  Keller  and  Arakawa get  scrambled)? When  does  Keller begin? Taking  the name  game  a step further, doesn’t  Keller stand eerily close to a purely syllabic,  nonsensical French  translation or (mistaken) rendering as Quelle heure (“What   time”)?   It  would be  wrong, however, to  consider this  opening sentence as a moment of blurring or of undecidability. A precise  mathematical operation is going  on from  square one, an operation termed “evening”: making even,  equating or equalizing, inventing a new  algorithm in which  afternoon is equivalent to  evening, Keller  to  Gins  and/or  Arakawa, narrator to  author or translator or “reador,” in a general pattern of hyper-translatability based  on the operation of a single  (core) particle  “or.”  A process  of hyper-translation occurs between two (possibly three)  varieties of “evening”: evening the noun,  even/ing the verb (to even), and one or several  species of eves or Eves.
