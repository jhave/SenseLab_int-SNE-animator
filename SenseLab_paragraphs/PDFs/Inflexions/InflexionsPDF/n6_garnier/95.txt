[13]              Cf.               http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-orientable_wormhole: “In theoretical physics, an Alice universe is a hypothetical universe. What a Klein bottle is to  a closed  two-dimensional surface,  an  Alice  universe is to  a closed three-dimensional volume. An Alice universe can be considered to allow  at least two    topologically-distinct   routes   between   any    two    points   (it   is doubly connected),   and    if   one    connection   (or   “handle”)   is   declared   to   be   a “conventional” spatial connection, at  least  one  other  must  be  deemed to  be  a non-orientable wormhole connection. […] As with  a Möbius  strip,  once  the  two distinct  connections  have   been   made,    we   can   no   longer    identify  which connection is ‘normal’ and  which  is ‘reversed’ — the  lack of a global  definition for charge  becomes  a feature of the global geometry.”
