In the following sentence from the opening chapter of KorA, in which  a multiple, stranded-wire voice  remembers “the  many  tales  told  to  me,  into  me,  so that  I might  form  – for  the  sake  of my  forming – an  abiding picture of the  world” (KorA: 2), both  “forming” and  “abiding” occupy  a labile  “mean,” a limitrophic position of  imbalance.  An  “abiding”  picture  designates  or  delineates both   a lasting,   durable image  and  a  two-dimensional surface  suddenly blown   up  to three-dimensional proportions, a volume in which  to abide:  a place of (nomadic) abode.  Keller or Arakawa’s procedure is approached in terms  which  resort  to an equally limitrophic, swiveling verb  (as  well  as  a  “false”  cognate according to French  dictionaries), “to  rally”:  “I proceed to  search  out  the  rallying points of alignment” (KorA: 6).   “Rally”  entangles the  quasi-transparent French  relier (to link)  to  the  less-straightforward  sense  of  “to  recover,”  “to  perk   up,”   or  “to resuscitate.” To rally does not function here as a “pun,” as an ornate quibble puncturing or  punctuating an  otherwise serious discursive façade:  a point,  in Gins and  Arakawa as in Deleuze and  Guattari, is always a “point of alignment,” always and  implacably on the  verge  of being  translated into  a line or a path.  A path,  in  the  language of Gins  and  Arakawa, retranslatable as a touch-and-tell, tactile tool or walk-through (to be followed, for example in the “Birds”  chapter of KorA, in which  the “phoneme” [th] takes over).
