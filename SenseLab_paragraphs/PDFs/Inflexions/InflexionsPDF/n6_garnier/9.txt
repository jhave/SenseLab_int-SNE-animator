Madeline Gins’s post-subject, the  “sky-of-an-I,” initiates a nomadic, on-the-spot translation  process   from   Standard   English   to   Arakawa+Gins-English  –  an (entirely new) “A-G-E” or “agencing” of language. Not only does the new plastic and  pliant compound displace the classic “I,” the vowel-sized English  subject:  it attributes to  it  a  new  “fiction   of  place,”   a  phonematic as  well  as  capacious existence   resting  on  a  shared,  stretchable diphthong,  on  an  air-born  or  air- eddied, two-wheel micro-machine: I/sky. Translation at this  stage  is confronted to  a  fork  in  the  road   (and   should take  it),  between  semantic fidelity   and   a (perhaps higher) form  of fidelity  to the superior sound of a repeated diphthong, without which  the apparatus would collapse.  An equivalent sound-fiction or swiveling effect  is  called  for  –  a  place  from  which   to  extract   and   construct equivalent “meaning.” [4]
