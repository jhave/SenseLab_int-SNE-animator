occurrence used  as  a heading to:  “The  claim.”  Both  are  graphically equipped with  the T-square tool of the trade. But re-configuring architecture-as-life (as the knack   to  live  on   until   indefinitely),  requires  no  architect’s   T  –little   or  no orthogonality:  it  thrives, rather,  on  [th]’s.  “The”  and   “then” are  literally “as precise  can  be.”  If T’s belong  to terra firma, [th]’s pertain to the  smooth, mixed medium of  a  “terra (fairly)  ferma”   – one  growing in  its  pregnant, bracketed middle. One  of the  ways  of translating the  T-ridden title  of an earlier  work,  To Not To Die, would be, therefore, to endeavor to harness a force equivalent to the voiceless  dental plosive:  to duplicate its blow.  A faithful rendering as “Pour ne pas mourir” fails, to some  extent,  to capture the  impetus of Gins’s  locution (by placing on a level  with  what  would be a defused version of it: “in order not  to die” or “so as not to die”).
