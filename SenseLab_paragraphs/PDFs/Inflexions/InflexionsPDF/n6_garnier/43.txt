affects  the  knotted, quasi-Brailled letter  in the  midst of the  “uncouth” name  of “Keller-or-Arakawa.”  Its  “imperfectly  naturalized”  K’s  challenge  the untouchability of the proper name,  begging to digitally or graphically seized, therefore connected, in the process,  to an outside or nomos. If a “person” is given the  choice  of becoming, after  Gins  and  Arakawa, an  “organism-that-persons,” one  that  is awarded an  environment and  is warded, guarded by  it,  a  similar change can  affect  the  proper name.   Taking  into  account the  fact  that  (some) names happen to be visited by “foreign” traits  or nomadic lines, by forces blown in  from  without, a name  become  retranslatable as  equivalent to  a “nomos”:  a “space  of contact,  of small  tactile  or  manual actions  of contact” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 371).
