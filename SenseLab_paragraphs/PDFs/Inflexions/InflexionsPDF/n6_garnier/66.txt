How  far  is Derrida’s piece  of flotsam  and  jetsam,  the  objet trouvé of seashore coral,  from   Madeline  Gins’s  own   or-grown,  littoral   conversation  in  the  last chapter of Helen Keller or Arakawa, “Critical  Beach,”  a multilingual conversation recording the  voice  of a beach  answering (in an unheard-of, or-filled,  or-grown tongue) the  questions of  a  multiple subject-in-process?  How   far  is  Madeline Gins’s extraction and  generation of “or’s”  (from  words)  from  Derrida’s musings on the Greek  word for “place”? Prompted by Derrida’s fascination with  a Greek term,  Peter  Eisenman responds to the “choric”  effects of the “choral”: “For me it means  corral  as enclosure, coral  as stone  and  coral  as color,  choral  as a group musical work,  and  choral  as chora” (Eisenman, in Ulmer  1994: 227). Three  words stand out  in Eisenman’s series  as ill-assorted with  the  “space” of Arakawa and Gins: enclosure, stone,  and  sacred  group singing. Equally  ill-matched is “coral” which  Eisenman reterritorializes and  congeals into  stone,  in contradistinction to the  way  Derrida processes it (by  dislocating it to the  space  of the  “seashore”). The term  “coral”  is indeed heard as part  of the voice of “Critical  Beach” in such a way  that  it stands at a “critical” distance from Eisenman’s neo-formalist grasp of Chora-related terms  – as appears at the end of the following excerpt:
