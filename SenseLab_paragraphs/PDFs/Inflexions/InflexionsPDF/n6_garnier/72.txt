Common  to  Madeline Gins  and   to  Derrida-or-Hélène-Cixous  (also  a  strange choric  alliance  or jointure) is the premise of an inside-out exchangeability of the inclusive and  the included, the “choric”  chance  or choice of evening as an accommodating, pliant word-event. As to Derrida’s grammatological fascination for  the   “act   of  writing,”  his  restless   pursuit  or  tracing   (of)  trace,   and   his understanding of chora in print-related terms  –, one  might  add  that  that,  too, is contained and  echoed  in Helen Keller or Arakawa’s digital composition, or in the “interdigitatings” of Making Dying Illegal.
