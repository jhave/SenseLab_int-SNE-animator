Two  K’s braid  the  title  of Helen Keller or Arakawa into  a loose,  cleaving knot, positing  an  anexact   equation  between  two   variables,  two   nouns  articulated around a core particle, sharing the same  cutting/pasting phoneme. Disregarding the fact that “Keller”  and “Arakawa” are proper nouns, both might  have much  to say in response to the  Oxford English Dictionary’s comment that  K-words signal “foreign words of recent  adoption, many  of them  very  imperfectly naturalized” and  to the  additional, stigmatizing reflection that  words so equipped stand out as non-native and  non-integrated: “the  more  recent  tendency has been  to favour the use of K [in some  initial  positions] (…) [in] non-English initial  combinations (…) by which  the uncouth or barbarous character of the words is more  strongly suggested.” The  K-entry  then  lists  numerous cases  of scientific  formalizations based  on the letter,  among which:  k, the quantum number determined by Niels Bohr  in  1920; k,  the  letter  representing thermal conductivity;  K.E, for  kinetic energy;   k  for  kilo  or  one  thousand. In  the  same   translatory,  roaming  vein, Deleuze and  Guattari’s collective  agencings might  aptly  be renamed K Plateaus, suddenly  relocated  in   the   K-friendly  environment  of  Keller   or   Arakawa’s myriad-keyed  name(s) – while  such  judgmental  adjectives  as  “uncouth” and “barbarous”  stand  out   as  cut-off   points  separating  the   questionable  value judgment of a ruling “logos”  from the possibilities of a nomadic letter.
