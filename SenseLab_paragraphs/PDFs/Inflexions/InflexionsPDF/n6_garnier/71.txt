“Rêve {dream}, there’s  a vocable  that  finds  itself joined  in her work, via alliance  or alloying, to the  significance of syllables  and  values bigger   and   smaller  that   its  own   body,   at   once   included and including, such  as réveil, évènement, revenir, revenant {waking, event, to come  back,  revenant}, and,  above  all, Eve, the  first  woman and Hélène Cixous’s mother. In the English  language (…) eve is also the hour  of vigil,  of watch-keeping, as in evening. We might  also  and even say that  evening is the secret  watching-over an act of writing, which  gathers and  shapes, dreams and  reveals  {rêve  et révèle}  this quasi-equation, this restless  equating, this turbulent equalising, evening, that  comes and  goes between rêve, Ève, évènement, éveil and réveil {dream, Eve, event, wake, waking}.
