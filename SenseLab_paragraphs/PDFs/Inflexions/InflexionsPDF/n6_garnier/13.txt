It  takes  two,  two  different  etymologies, to  make  a  line,  if  one  relies  on  the strangely  dividing  root   of  the  word  “line”   according  to  the  Oxford  English Dictionary: “two  words, ultimately of the same  etymology, have  coalesced 1° (…)

How  should one “translate” the flexible  “lines”  of Madeline Gins  and  Arakawa, given  the  fact  that  they  seem both   to  invite   and   preempt  translation? How   does   one  translate  a  book-in- translation, one  in which  translation is elevated to the  power of (at least)  two? Madeline Gins’s  invitation in  Word  Rain  to  “read right  read  write” suggests, beyond  homophony,  the  need   to  strike   (at  least)  twice   –  to  repeat,  with   a difference (Gins 1969: 1).
