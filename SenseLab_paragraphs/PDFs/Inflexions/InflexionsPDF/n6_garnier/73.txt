A line  of fault,  however, seems  to  run  between, on  the  one  “hand,” a field  of thought broadly described as post-phenomenological (in the wake  of Hegel, Heidegger and  Husserl) and,  on  the  other  hand, the  heterogeneous, “classical” map  or area  on which  Deleuze and  Guattari have  inscribed their  array  of names and   concepts  (from   Stoicism   and   pre-Socratic  philosophy   to   Hume,  Kant, Bergson  and  Simondon among others).  One  way  of negotiating or  skirting the abyss   is  to  envisage Helen  Keller or Arakawa  as  a  transducing  or  translating principle, as a recoding machine, a transcoder between one area of discourse (Cixous  and  Derrida) and  the next (Deleuze and  Guattari) – a “Gilles Deleuze or Derrida”  machine, acknowledging  the  fact  that  a  (desiring)  machine, from  a Deleuze  and   Guattari  angle,   only   works   by  breaking down  (Deleuze and Guattari 1984: 286). Such a machine would not  be an interpretation or semantic translation  machine, one  “whose function is  to  unmask, decode, and disambiguate x,”  but  an  ambiguating,  fuzzy-logic, many-core cloud  computer (Caputo 2004: 53).
