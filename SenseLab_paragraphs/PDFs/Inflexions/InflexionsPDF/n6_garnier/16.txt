touch  of the  “afternoon,” emerges the  faint  suggestion of a luncheon offered  in “all-inclusive” conditions, service  included. Yet any  reader will have  more  than one   reason  to  suspect  that   something  else  is  going   on,  that   both   life  and something larger  than  life  are  invited into  this  opening  sentence, which  acts, literally, as an “opening,” incisive  procedure: one that  affects logos  and  its logic at  its  core.  Although no  character is  introduced, a  strangely breathing  effect invades its  avenues, prompted by  the  “atmosphere” which  the  sentence both conveys and  exists as, carries  and  forms.  The opening line happens literally as a double, etymological line, as a thread of flexible flax, bendable in more  than  one direction. Built  into  it are  sound effects  based  on  fricatives – the  “afternoon,” “flexible  enough” – which  perform the  flexible  promise: two  different spellings for one sound, once uttered, twice spelt: /f/ or /gh/.
