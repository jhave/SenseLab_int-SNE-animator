One of Gins and Arakawa’s signature terms  “cleaving” finds  its simultaneous, near-automatic translation,  for  example,  in  the  writing of  Hélène Cixous,   whose   innovative writing regularly ransacks language to  find  unstable patterns and  bottomless, reversible terms.  If all fails, invention takes over, resulting in nonce  creations, coinages or collages  such  as her “séparéunir” (to separeunite) which  cleaves  both ways. [11]
