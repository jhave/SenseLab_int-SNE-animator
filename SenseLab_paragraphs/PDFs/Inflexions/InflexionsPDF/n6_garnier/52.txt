receptacle, a compartment or cavity,  or to a microscopic portion of protoplasm enclosed in a membrane. Keller lends  itself to translation, forming one of the self- translating  machines  at   work   in   Madeline  Gins’s   book,   as   a   cryptonym conveying, literally, a crypt,  an underground “cellar”  or dark  (and  soundproof) enclosure. Yet it is also a nomadic name  that  performs its own  local commuting or   commutating  between  several   relays,   phonetically  equipped  to   form   a strangely partial or metamorphic k/l-eaving, a consonant-based process.  Keller cleaves,  so to speak,  in the act of being performed, sped  up, or uttered, following Hamlet’s advice,  “trippingly on the  tongue.” In  translatio the  name  welcomes a series of lateral  displacements – agreeing, as it were,  to be accelerated into a clé (a key, a connecting device),  collated into a portable, cleaving exercise,  reverse- engineered into  a cellar,  or metamorphosed into  several  French  phonetic body- doubles:  a  feminine pronoun  (quelle?), a  mistaken question (“quel  air”?),  and much  air and erring.
