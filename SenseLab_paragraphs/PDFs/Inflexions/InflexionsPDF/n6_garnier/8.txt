of Arakawa’s 1984 etching. Although namelessness might,  at face value,  be taken (or  mistaken) to  refer  to  intertextuality, to  the  weaving of kindred voices  and texts  visiting Madeline Gins’s volume – excerpts from  Keller’s diary,  poems by Rimbaud, Dogen,  translations of Ponge  and  others  – the  concept  bifurcates to include, beyond citationality, the urge  to resist the proper name.  Rubbing elbows with  what  Deleuze and  Guattari have  conceptualized as collective  agencings and post-individual  haecceities, “the  nameless” finds  itself  in  translation, imported and  accommodated in the  opening paragraphs of Helen Keller or Arakawa [3] in the form of an “I” having metamorphosed into a “sky-of-an-I” (Gins 1994: 1-2). It is  up  to  the  reader/translator to  take  it  from  there,   to  enter   Helen Keller or Arakawa’s  reinvented  idiom,   hewn  in  such   a  way   as  to  travel   the  distance between “sky”  to “I” and  back. For blind  Helen  Keller-and/or-haptic-Arakawa, travelling happens on the spot  (as well as to the dot,  between the dots  of Braille writing and pictured or diagrammed points).
