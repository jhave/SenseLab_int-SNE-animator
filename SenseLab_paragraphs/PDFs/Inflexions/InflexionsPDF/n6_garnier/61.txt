Julia Kristeva borrows the same  concept  from  Plato’s Timaeus “to denote an essentially mobile  and  extremely provisional articulation constituted  by movements and  their ephemeral stases […] Neither model  nor copy, the chora precedes and underlies figuration and this specularization, and is analogous only to vocal  or kinetic  rhythm” (Kristeva 1984: 26). Kristeva is concerned with understanding how a poet or a “subject  in process” (such as Mallarmé or Lautréamont) achieves what  she calls a “transversal rhythmicity,” for which  the “best  metaphor,” she claims,  “would not  be the  grammatical categories it redistributes, but rather a piece of music or a work  of architecture” (126).
