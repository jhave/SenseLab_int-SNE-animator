But a question remains: what  about  “geometry”? Not only is geometry one of the objects included in the sentence: the line itself behaves as the arranger or planner of a strange geometric deformation, wrapping the object it becomes  and  exists as. How   can   the   “all-inclusive”  become   “included”?  Nowhere  is   it   logically receivable to include the all-inclusive, except  within/without Gins and  Arakawa coordinates. The first sentence in the book is engineered as a Klein bottle,  a non- orientable volume in which  left and  right  change places, a volume whose  “all” or entirety insists  on  carrying a remainder – the  “flexible  enough.” In German, a “Klein   bottle”   or   “Klein  Flasche” also   came   into   existence   as  an   object-in- translation, having changed names as a consequence of mistranslation or misunderstanding – its name  being  a Kleinsche Fläche or “Klein  surface,” which evolved, by mistake, into  a ”Kleinsche Flasche” or “Klein  bottle”  (one served, too, in inclusive conditions).
