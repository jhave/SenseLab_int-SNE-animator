“The,”  the  article  on  which  Helen Keller or Arakawa opens,  is everything but  a determiner. If translating it involves no specific  creativity, coming  to grips  with the  full  range  of its  effects  implies a different, though quasi-identical, form  of translation, i.e. literally taking  a fast-forward jump  to chapter 21 and  its spate  of cascading, /th/ phonemes (gone  “morphemic”), or, alternately, jumping back to Madeline Gins’s What the President Will Say and Do, more  specifically to its “Introduction to THE history of THE,” in which  one reads:  “Every  THE is a translation” (Gins  1984: 144).  The  piece  ends   on:  “a  kiss  to  those  who  have finished this  article,”  where “article” points to the determiner as much  as to the essay  on  the  article.  “Article” becomes  a case  of literal  and  lateral  “translatio” rather than  a mere  pun  or antanaclasis (the repetition of the same  word taken  in two  different senses  or more).  It differs  from  antanaclasis by involving one,  or two,   many   bodies.   “The”   is   made    to   operate  as   a   jack,   as   a   connector retranslatable into  a kiss  – short-circuiting textual limitations and  inventing a reader-writer-”kisser”-surround.
