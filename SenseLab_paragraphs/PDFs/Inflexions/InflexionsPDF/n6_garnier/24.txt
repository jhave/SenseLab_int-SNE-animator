To “draw a blank” is imported from  an early-modern game  of lottery named, in French  “la blanque” – after  bianco, the  Italian  name  of the  same  game.  Whoever draws a “blanque” – a white  ticket  bearing no prize  – loses.  But to “draw” also demands to be taken  in its graphic sense,  in which  case the  game  changes: loss becomes  gain, the loss of aural  and  visual  data  metamorphoses into new  ground and  new background: into the condition of graphicality and  of diagramming. Philologically, “blank” is a word with a hinge  to it, akin to bleak – which  oscillates between the polarities of black and  blank. Nothing is blacker  than  the blankness of a blank  computer screen  – translated in French  as “un écran noir” (a black screen). Similar  folds form in the multiple acceptations of the verb “to draw”: 1) to pick a lottery ticket  2) to trace  a line 3) to attract or extract  air. A gale,  draft,  or “vent” (French  for “wind”) blows through the cracks of the event.
