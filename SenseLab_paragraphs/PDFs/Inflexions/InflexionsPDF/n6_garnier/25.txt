Translation is mostly  conceived as a one-way ticket  leading from  here  to there, from   a   “source”  to   a   “target”  language.  Rather    than    “target”  anything, translating Helen Keller or Arakawa promotes a  non-ballistic, nomadic  form  of translation – the  term  “nomadic” being  used  after  Toynbee (and  Deleuze and Guattari) to describe, contrary to what  one might  expect, what  travels on the spot or  “in  place,”  in  an  immobile fashion.    In  “trans/lating,” the  “trans-” or  “in- between” has,  on  other   words, “taken on  all  the  consistency”  (Deleuze  and Guattari 1987: 380). As an (auto-)translating book,  Helen Keller or Arakawa grows from  the  particle “or”  which   thrives in  its  title  before  growing into  a  quasi- language of its  own,  vehicle-and-tenor all in  one,  liberated in  the  book’s  “or”- studded final chapter “Critical  Beach.” Meaning is a function of what  happens in the “mean,” in the “middle” or “intermezzo” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 380).
