classic textual models involving binary oppositions and  crisscrossing. Madeline Gins’s “line,”  rather, proceeds as a nomadic anti-fabric, as an “aggregate of intrication” which  “contrasts point  by point  with  the  space  of fabric,  (….) is in principle infinite,   open,  and  unlimited in  every  direction (…) [and]  does  not assign  fixed  and  mobile  elements but  rather distributes a continuous variation” (Deleuze and  Guattari 1987: 475-476). The  nomadic material described as non- fabric by Deleuze and  Guattari fits the non-subject, the “sky-of-an-I” as a perfect- fit garment, as a supple anti-fabric indexing “clothing and  the house  itself to the space of the outside, to the open  smooth space in which  the body  moves” (476).
