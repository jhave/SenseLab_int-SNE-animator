Another soundtrack informs the  syllables  of Gins’s  initial  sentence, which,  like Henry Miller’s  weed  grows  in  the  middle and  from  its  middle, in  the  clause inserted between commas. [5] What  constitutes the  phonetic building blocks  of the  syntagm: “including an all-inclusive atmosphere with  evening” is an [in] or [ing]  series,  possibly signatory, forming an  acoustic  thread, a nasalized entranceway “in” or across the textual threshold: “including,” “inclusive,” “evening.” Thus  paired, the  two  phonemes form  a differential micro-pattern in which   two  nearly   similar   nasals,   [in]  and   [ing]  (alveolar versus  velar  nasal) occupy  opposite sides  of the “mechanism” of meaning. [6] The nasalized closure of [in] (an inclusion-prone phoneme) is turned inside  out,  in the  case of “-ing.” As an  open-ended syntactic contrivance, [ing]  becomes  the  chiral,  atmospheric opposite  of  [in].  [7]  As  Linda   Pillière   remarks  in  her   stylistic   analysis  of Architectural Body, “the ‘ing’ form has the advantage of presenting an action imperfectly, as an  open-ended process” (Pillière  2010: 212). A similar  disparity occurs  with  the  juxtaposition of including/evening, the  verbal  force  of the  first term  having a tendency to curb  or flex the second term  and  make  it enter  verbal territory (“evening,” as in “to even”).  Against the sense  of closure  and  inclusion, “ing” achieves an effacement of time and space limits, smoothing the striations of whatever  frames   or  limits   into   an   anexact,   porous,  open-ended  stretch   of spacetime. “Evening” does double duty, both as a marker of graphic reversibility
