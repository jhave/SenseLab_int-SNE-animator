These virtues have  been praised by others  familiar with  the hazards of grappling with  tentativeness in  language. Malevich with  his  “non-objectivism”,  Moholy- Nagy  with  his “vision-in-motion” philosophy (1947), Kepes  warning of the perniciousness of “object-concepts” (1945: 14), and  David  Bohm,  who  proposed the “rheomode” as a physicist’s solution to a positivist’s lexicon, all campaigned with  a certain  species-redemptive rigor for just these virtues. And  in a number of other  places  we  find  words that  form  a kind  of family  with  landing sites,  each committed in its own  way  to non-  or minimum foreclosure on  the  things they denote. “Chunk,” as  a  term   in  Wolfgang  Iser’s  phenomenological theory  of literary reception (1978: 109-110), and  Fernande St. Martin’s  “coloreme” (1990: 5-
10), replacing point  and  object as base terms  for a visual  semiotics, are both good examples, not to mention the good  word “thing” itself.
