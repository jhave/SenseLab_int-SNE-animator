The scheme: The graphicalization scheme  we develop will have  to rely on the establishment  of   a   basic   ontology,  a   reference  vocabulary   of   marks    and meanings, that  will allow  us to link basic items  of biotopological observation to clear  shorthand signs,  easily  manipulated to produce further and  more  precise, or calculatedly vaguer, meanings.
