Finally,  as  perhaps the  last  argument for  trusting that  a graphical vocabulary could   provide useful   terms   for  a  landing site  theory is  the  realization  that, inevitably, the  graphic ontology in use  would constitute a world as relevant to the  current articulation as the  one  being  reported on.  In fact the  language of a graphicalization scheme  like this ensures the validity of its expressions precisely by situating itself in the world of the landing objects and  landing operations described. It is enactive in this  sense,  not  representational, thereby qualifying it all the more  for biotopological service.  As Arakawa and  Gins put  it, loosely paraphrased, not a field of facts about,  but a meadow of knowing among.
