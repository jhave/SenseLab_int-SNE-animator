caveating that  we  need.  For example, a scalable  variable like graphic “weight” (i.e. ink density, opacity, resolution) can be set to mark  the degree of phenomenal/material  reality   we   should  ascribe   to   it   in   the   uptake.  The materiality of digital graphic display technologies is particularly apt  for showing/suggesting a full range  of shadings in anything’s or everything’s being, and   for  keeping clear  that  every   concrete   has  its  dissolve. By  pinning pixel density (luminosity) to ontological density (degree of being)  in this  way  we can agilely  correlate between scaleless  metaphysical measures and  precise  electro- magnetic values  in the  display technology. Very  fine philosophical distinctions, or   accounting  with   great   sensitivity  for   subtle   shadings  of  biotopological emphasis, become  as easy as setting  stroke  weight or transparency in Photoshop, even easier.
