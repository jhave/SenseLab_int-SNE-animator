Taken as a whole  and  added to and  enhanced, I suggest that  a batch  of resources like  this   gives   us   the   promise  of  a  comprehensive  graphic  lingualism  for depicting  current  awareness  diagrammatically,  implementable  in  a  range   of media, and  additional to our human capacities for tracking, thought and  action. I hope  some of those reading this will be involved in making it happen.
