Already landing site, as a first word, and  as a first word should, gives  us good reach   into  a  nearly   blank   but   already  articulable world.  The  eventuality  of landing pre-articulates the fore-called-for lexicon  with  a few thin  but  mighty distinctions.  Landing  happens   either    electric   with    current   afferent  input (perceptual landing), or, direct  perception paused, more  or less without afferent/external  reference (imaging), and  the difference decides so much  about what  happens, and  how  it will be taken  into  account. With  the  short  list above, do we not already have an extremely valuable set of basic(ish)  elements, half-able on their  own  to call into existence  the kind  of graphicalization scheme  we need? How   much   of  all  we   are   waiting  for,  to  begin   assembling  a language/graphicalization scheme  for what  we  want  it for: puzzling ourselves out?
