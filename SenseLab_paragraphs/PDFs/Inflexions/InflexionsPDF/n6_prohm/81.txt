Matching the approximative rigor  of the word landing site in a visual  marker is not  easy,  but  fortunately the  visualization  capacities of  contemporary digital media give us good  resources and  half a chance  of fulfilling  these cleaven (clinging/cloven; pronounced like leaven  or heaven) functions. For one thing  the rheomodic nature of the term  (tentatively objectified  but  really  verby)  is easy  to embody. Landing site adds to the specificity of site the range  and tentativeness of landing. And  in visual  terms  this  simultaneity is easy  to make  apparent. Thing, in this  semantics, can be inflected as event,  and  the  substantiality of site shown for a function of landing.
