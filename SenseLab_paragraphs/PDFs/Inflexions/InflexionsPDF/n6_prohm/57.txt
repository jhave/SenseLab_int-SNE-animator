The dim switch: The basic gist of this language’s self- and  thing-undercutting semantics can be taught and demonstrated to new users  with the help of a simple ontological dim-switch. In the  user’s  manual, readers will  be made  aware that the graphicalization scheme  is opacity-specific with  respect to ontology or phenomenality, so that  * has  a higher phenomenality than  *, even  though it is smaller or farther away.  In the  online  version of the  user’s  manual, interactive demo  graphics will show  readers a dot, and  next to it a dim-switch. On the knob of the  switch  it reads  “EXISTS” and  on the  edge  of the  dial  is an arrow, which when turned aligns  with  points on a scale arc between 0 and  100%. Readers are invited to turn  the  knob,  dimming or  darkening the  dot.  At  0 it fades  to total blank.  At  100 it goes  black  with  saturation and  density. Next  they  are  shown pictures of a loved  one, the milky-way galaxy  and  God, and  are invited to do the same  with  each.  This  brief  demonstration ends  with  the  reminder:  whenever you’re   facing   new   percepts  or  terminology,  remember  the  ontological  dim- switch.  It goes to 0 on everything.
