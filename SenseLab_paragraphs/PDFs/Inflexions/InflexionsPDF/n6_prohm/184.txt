[4] Since these storyboards were first drafted, I have had  the opportunity to build a large-scale physical construction on the  site of Arakawa and  Ginsâ€™ Bioscleave House in East  Hampton, NY. A diagramming structure for volumetric sensing, projection  and  discernment, it is compatible with  the  kind  of graphicalization scheme  envisioned in this paper, and  brings  in a universe of materiality that  will magnify its efficacies. I call it the Tubular Loom.
