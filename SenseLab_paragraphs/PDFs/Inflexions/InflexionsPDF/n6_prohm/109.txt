References. For each term  or set of terms  I try to point  to a few pages,  a chapter, in some  cases  a  book,  where the  scheme   or  system   can  be  located,   learned or referred to. The source  cited is not in every  case the original or definitive source; useability has  been  a  factor  in  choosing. Most  references are  to  sections  with diagrams, or to structural descriptions that  would be easy  to diagram. In many cases  the  terms/concepts  given  are  just  the  tip  of  that  authorâ€™s iceberg.  Each represents an articulatory resource that  can be applied concretely to the  task  of visualizing some aspect  or another of awareness.
