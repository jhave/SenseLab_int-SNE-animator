The idea that we could  meaningfully diagram our current awareness is ludicrous (/impossible) at one  level,  of course,  given  the  interwafted vastness of what  is really  there.  But a wide  range  of works  exist that  have  made  valiant attempts in this direction. And  strong fields of theory exist that  reveal  a spatial/diagrammatic/kinetic  nature to  what   goes  on  as  awareness/knowing,
