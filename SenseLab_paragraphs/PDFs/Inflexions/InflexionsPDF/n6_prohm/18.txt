Biotopology and  coordinology would be the  same  word, did  not  the  difference between  a  field   and   an  activity   within  it  still  deserve  some   emphasis.  To construct poeisis  is the  same  as to construct coordinology; only  if it werenâ€™t  for the promise of biotopology, there  would be no need  to do so. And  the promise of biotopology, of course,  is how not to die.
