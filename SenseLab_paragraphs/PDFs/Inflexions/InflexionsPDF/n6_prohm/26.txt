Such a tool would be a boon to biotopologists and art observers alike, making the process  of “getting it all down” easier  and  more  articulately inflectible.  It would empower the sensorium to explain “in its own  words” what  it went  through in constructing  a  given   passage  of  meaning,  and   what   a  certain   passage  of experience seems  to consist  of. Laying  out  the  landing site configuration of the moment, and  laying  out  the  landing site  configurations of sequential moments over an extended passage, biotopologists will be better  able to observe the micro- or  infra-procedurality involved in an  organism’s  organisming or  personing, as such.
