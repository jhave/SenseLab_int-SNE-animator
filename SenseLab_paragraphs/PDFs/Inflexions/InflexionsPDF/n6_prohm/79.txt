Dots: The most  basic of our visual  terms  must  serve  the articulatory urgencies of tentativeness and  specification with  equal  ability.  Landing site,  translated into visual  terms,  inseminates a graphic space  with  the  potential articulation range that  is biotopology. Since this  term  must  serve  recordings and  reportings at the pinnacle  of  the  language’s  (approximative-rigorous)  abstraction  capacity, the most likely graphic candidate would be a dot, even more approximative-rigorous than  a  point,   whose   mathematical definition already suits  our  purposes very well; metaphysical and  full of blank.  But dot  or point  modified by the insight of the  foundational(un)  isomorphism,  i.e  self-destabilizing,  subject   to  the ontological  dim   switch,   and   non-siftable  from   out   of  the   current  of  actual landing.   Nearly best-formulated in  the  class  of self-erasing substantives is St. Martin’s   term   “coloreme”, cut  to  serve  as  the  basic  unit  of  visual   language, without the usual vices of basic units.
