As an example, James’ “Stream of Thought” chapter includes very interesting attempts to  diagram how  a  thought flows  along  the  sequence of  words in  a simple  sentence (James 1950: 257, 269, 272, 282-3), and  his chapter on association presents compelling field/force diagrams of association pulling differentially between an  item  and  others  it might  call to mind. Then  there  is the  more  vital underlying  schemata  James   offers   for  thinking  current  awareness diagrammatically – as  a current or  stream. Dozens  of other  examples come  to mind:   including  Varela‘s  4-Fold  structure of  nowness, Husserl’s structure  of internal   time-consciousness,  landing   sites   in   Arakawa  and    Gins’   theory, biograms as Erin Manning and Brian Massumi use the term, and many  more.
