[1] The Title of this  talk  is indebted to the title of a paper by Martin Rosenberg, “Constructing AutoPoDisis: The Architectural Body in Light of Contemporary Cognitive Science”  in Interfaces no.  21/22 vol.  1, Paris,  2003. The  idea  and  any possible realization is  of  course   indebted to  the  researches   of  Arakawa and Madeline Gins, and  to their  own  extensive diagramming, in particular in Constructing  the Perceiver – Arakawa : Experimental Works, The National Museum Of Modern Art, Tokyo, 1991.
