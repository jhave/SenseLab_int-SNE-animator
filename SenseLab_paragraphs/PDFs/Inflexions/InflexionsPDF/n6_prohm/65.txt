In  brief,  the  new  field  of  biotopology arrives on  the  scene  with terms  that  show  promise of being  able to jockey or slip into  place, in diagrams and  reports, levels of abstraction necessary to its stated purpose.  Biotopologyâ€™s  initial   lexicon:   allowing  tendency; architectural surround;  architectural body;  as-if-woven breathing web of landing sites; axis of possibility; bioscleave; bioscleavic atmospheric   surround;   cleaving;    coordinated   cleaving; coordinating skill; dawning factors; event-fabric; farfarground; farground;     farmiddleground;     farnearground; farnearmiddleground;   interactively  diagrammatic  situation; landing   site;   landing-site   configuration;   meadow;   middlefar- ground; middleground; middlemiddleground; middlenearfar- ground; middlenearground; middlenearmiddleground; multi- dimensional interactive diagram/dia-gramming; multiscape; nearfarground; nearfarmiddleground; near-ground; near- middlefarground; nearmiddleground; nearnearground; omniscape; organizing principle(s); reversible destiny; scale(s) of action;  self- diagram;  swift  consideration(s); tactically  posed surround;  tissues of density; thas; thit; tutelary abode;  ubiquitous site.
