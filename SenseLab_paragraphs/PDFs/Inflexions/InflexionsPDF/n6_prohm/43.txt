Developing this  set of markers, both  vocabulary and  ontology, we  face certain serious challenges, challenges that  come with  any commitment to not sell the tentativeness of anything short.  A similar  challenge was  behind David  Bohm’s coinage  of the  “rheomode” as a language reform  that  involved remaking every noun  as a verb  in gerund form,  like running (Bohm 1980: ch. 2). What  serves  as an  ontology in the  functional sense  (permitting the  construction of a modeling system)   requires/inspires an  upgraded  ontology in  the  philosophical sense;  a revision of the assumption that  non-tentativeness exists. This set of markers, and the   graphicalization  scheme   they   are   used   in  must   therefore  be  designed carefully. The graphical object must  function in a non-objective semantics, to use Malevich’s  term,  facts  obsessively caveated with  the  refrain  “no  stable  state,” “no-inherent-existence” (Malevich 1944).
