The foundational isomorphism: The question of tentativeness leads  us to a first specification  for  this  vocabulary/ontology/set  of  markers,  namely  the foundational isomorphism: “phenomenal : visual”. How  or the degree to which something/anything shows   up  to  sentience, must  find  its  metaphor in  visual marks   and  attributes, aided by  verbal   naming and  construction. Vision  with words must  stand for the whole  of happening. While this limits  the channel unspeakably, it also supplies a challenge and  the constraints that  are the source of the language’s expressivity.
