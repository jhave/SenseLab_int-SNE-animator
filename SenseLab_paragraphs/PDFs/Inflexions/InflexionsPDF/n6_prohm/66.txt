The essential test  of any  language’s usability in saying  anything is its word for saying  thing.  It’s obvious that  this  would be the  critical  term  for assessing any language’s  viability,  because  it  is  at  once   the   pinnacle  of  that   language’s abstraction capacity (everything is a thing,  so the term  had  better  cast wide)  and the  buck-stop  knuckle-crunch down-to-earthness  of  its  contact   with   concrete landing (this thing).  Reality (as that  which  invites/receives/requires object-izing) is greeted with  a certain  first name,  and  the name  you  use will shape  the whole encounter.
