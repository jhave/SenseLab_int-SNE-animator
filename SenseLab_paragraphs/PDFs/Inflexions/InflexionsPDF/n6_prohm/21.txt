In the name  of all those  who  would more  approximative-rigorously observe and more  efficaciously understand  their  own  experience, I want  a graphicalization scheme  that  will allow  me maximum expressivity and  articulation in recording and  reporting on  the  many  dimensions of my  experience, but  with  an  extreme ease of handling, and  an extreme low barrier-to-entry, made  possible by a highly intuitive interface that minimizes the effort required to think  and  perceive with  it meticulously. Easy to use as a pencil, spreadsheet or your  mother tongue.
