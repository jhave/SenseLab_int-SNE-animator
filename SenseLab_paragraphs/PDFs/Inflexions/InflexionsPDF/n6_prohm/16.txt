A  person pulling spacetimemassenergy together as  meaning who  has  trained hirself   in  doing   this,   can   be  called   a  coordinologist,  or  said   to  be  doing coordinology. Coordinology and  poetics  would be the  same  word, only coordinology is more  explicit  about  the intelligence, concentration and  dexterity required of one  who  handles the  threads of life’s, and  the  universe’s, meanings themselves.
