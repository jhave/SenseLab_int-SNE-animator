In   verbal   language,  an   articulatory  system   is  not   troubled  much   by   the contradiction that  comes  of naming something in that  thing’s absence.  Its users may  be,  but  the  language as  a  device  couldn’t care  less.  In  a  visual   scheme however, where visibility maps  to phenomenal existence  or presence, the contradiction is more  apparent. A graphical thing  standing for  thought (e.g.  a dot) cannot  be used  in a formulation stating that that there  is no thought there, or that   thoughts  are   not   things,  without  employing  some   intelligent  kind   of corrective inflection.
