It is language-like in  this  sense  too.  It can  easily  adapt to  new  channels, and shrink or expand to fit and  optimally functionalize the available constraints (here using  InDesign and  Microsoft  Word).  In other  words, this  scheme  would work well  in short-hand as a quick  back-of-the-envelope jotting  habit,  in Flash-coded interactive   graphics   for   a   web-based   diagramming   application   on   your computer, or as something larger,  like an immersive motion-sensing holographic projection environment [3], or a purpose-built architecture like memory theaters, a powerloom or the abacus.
