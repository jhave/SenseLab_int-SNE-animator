A graphicalization scheme  that  could  adequately utter  landing, shedding ontological insinuations like water off a seal’s skin  and  sketching fine shades of emphasis relevant to  the  perceiving, imaging and  dimensionalizing going  on, could  hope  to do articulatory justice to this going  on like no scheme  before  it. A scheme  that  furthermore could  offer to support full biotopological reporting of a given  passage of experience, that  could  enable  an organism that  persons to get that  much  (or close  enough) down about  what  goes  on,  might  instrumentalize insight into  broad new  efficacies.  The  ability  to  catch  and  reenter that  which happens, as it happens, is clearly  a skill headed in the direction of greater reconfigurative capacity within the dynamis quo of world-constituting, better chances  and  more  agile  mastery at heading off facts before  they  reach  the  pass. “Destiny, hold  on,  reverse thyself.” No  magic  once  you’ve  managed it; just  a slight  training of handling landing to other  the world as it is happening/landing.
