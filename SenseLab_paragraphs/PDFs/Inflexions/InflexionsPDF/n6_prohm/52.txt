In our common vocabulary, or in semantic laws we have  taken  on without much question, wording on the question of anything or everything’s being  tends  to be binary  and   black-and-white-ish.  It  takes   some   insistence  to  say   otherwise. Standard semantics needs  the work-around of a metaphor from  other  sense modalities to sketch  any  shades of gray  into “to be or not to be” or its grammar of am and  am not. Like imaging in the first place, the “phenomenal : visual” isomorphism helps  language out  of  its  jam,  by  offering   a  parallel modelling realm  where gradations, dynamics and  vagaries can be expressed without losing the traction of a rigorous grasp and keeping track.
