The  problem for  biopolitics  arises   from  the  ‘entangled  tails’  as  survivorship curves   approach 0. This  entanglement puts   a  damper on  pushing the  curves further outward even  with  all the power of modern industrialized society  lined up  behind biopolitics. According to  biopoliticians, human beings  have  a genetically built-in tendency to die sometime before or around 92 years of age.[2] Humans are supposed to hit a biological  wall—a  genetic  barrier—during the entangled tail  phase of the  life expectancy curves.  According to  biopoliticians, during this  phase, our  probability of surviving from  year  to year  is about  50%. This   is  not   to  say   that   the   life  of  nonagenarians, centenarians, and supercentenarians is necessarily one of decrepitude, but  it is a life of chance:  the chance  of someone sneezing nearby and  your  catching a cold, flu, or pneumonia
