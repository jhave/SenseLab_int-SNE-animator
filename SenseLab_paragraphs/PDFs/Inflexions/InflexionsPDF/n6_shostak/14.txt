Thus,  the more  horizontal portions of the curves  have  risen  and  flattened due  to improvements in pre-  and  post-natal care of women, neonatal care, vaccination, and   treatment  of  infectious diseases  among  the  young.  Consequently  more babies   have   survived  to   become   juveniles   and   more   preadolescents  have advanced into  adulthood.[1] Simultaneously, the  more  vertical  portion of  the curve  is pushed to the right  by the increased numbers of young people surviving into  adulthood and  by middle-aged people surviving longer.  These  changes are generally attributed  to  reductions  in  exposure  to  hazards  such   as  those   in polluted air,  water, and   cigarette smoke,   and   to  increased  time  available  to individuals for rest, allowing their  bodies  to recuperate from the daily  assaults of normal life, especially those  suffered at work.  In addition, survival is promoted by improved treatment of chronic  diseaseâ€”although the  rampant epidemics of obesity  and  type  II diabetes suggest we are not  doing  everything we should be doing  to combat  chronic  disease.
