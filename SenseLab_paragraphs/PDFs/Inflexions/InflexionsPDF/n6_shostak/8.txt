Of course,  this  scenario would raise  hackles  among those  living  by the  dictates and  standards of biopolitics. Biopolitics  supports “anti-aging” medicine whereas Bioscleave  House is “pro-aging” without medicine. Aging  is a problem for biopolitics but  not for Arakawa and  Gins. Rather,  living  fully at every  age is the problem they  confront. Biopolitics  would have  increasing numbers of  human beings  living fragile and vulnerable lives as nonagenarians, centenarians, and supercentenarians. Bioscleave  House employs biotopology to  extend vigorous life throughout  prolonged  adulthood.  Biopoliticians make  metaphysical claims for  imminent  and   permanent  cures   of  disease  associated  with   aging   while Bioscleave  House espouses human enhancement and  the  evolution of vigorous life, promoting healthy living now and in generations to come.
