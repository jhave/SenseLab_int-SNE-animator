Slow growth is reflected in the  delayed age  of puberty in women compared to other    mammals.  [3]  Moreover,  women  experiencing  a   delay   in   reaching menopause have  not  only  grown old  more  slowly  than  other  women but  they tend  to be longer-lived (Perls  et al., 1997). Our  aging  is also  slow  compared to aging  in  other  primates. The  baboon mortality rate  doubles every  four  years compared  to   seven   to   eight   years   for   humans.  “[Thus,   h]umans.  .  .  age differently, and more slowly  than  baboons” (Tatar et al. 2009). The pioneering primatologist Sherwood Washburn insists  “there is strong direct  evidence for the slowing of [human] development” (Washburn 1981: 23).
