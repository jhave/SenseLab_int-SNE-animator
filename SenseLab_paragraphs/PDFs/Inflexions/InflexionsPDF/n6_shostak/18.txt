But this is the limit of ‘squaring’. Indeed, squaring the curve  has only a few more years  to go before  it is squared to saturation! If biopolitics is allowed to continue on  its  present  trajectory, projected  life  expectancies  will  increase   for  white women born  in 2100 to 102 years  of age, black women and  white  men  to 97, and black men to 90. Even if the conquest of diseases is complete by 2200 as projected by biopoliticians, life expectancy at birth  would be 117 years  for white  women,
112  for  black   women  and   white   men,   and   105  for  black   men   in  the   US (Olshansky, et al., 1990). This is all that biopolitics has to offer.
