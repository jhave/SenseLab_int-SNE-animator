Fortunately,  an  artist   and   a  poet   have   created  a  shelter  from   biopolitics in Bioscleave House and  provided an inspiration to live in real time. Of course, biopoliticians grumble that  claims  made  for  Bioscleave  House are  unscientific, anecdotal, and  lack  controls. But scientific  studies in public  health and  disease management are frequently heuristic, beginning with  anecdotal evidence—with exploratory studies—and 150,000 years  of human evolution have  provided  all the controls one needs!
