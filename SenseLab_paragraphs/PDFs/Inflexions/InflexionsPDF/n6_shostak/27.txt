Arakawa and  Gins have shown us how to take control  of our destiny and  human evolution! It is simply a matter of scale. Enhancing human life will also promote the  outward evolution of longevity. Biologists  call it “niche  construction”: how the activities of organisms bring  about  changes in their  environments and, consequently, in their  own  evolution—how a species’ activity  feeds  back on the species’ environment and hence on its evolution.
