test Bioscleave  House’s  impact on wellbeing and  longevity in a larger  number of volunteers drawn from  an enlarged pool  of possible subjects.  Finally,  having demonstrated that  Bioscleave  House works  as intended, it would be ready for Phase  III, multicenter trials  on  large  groups for  long  durations aimed at  the definitive assessment of effectiveness in comparison with  the current “gold standard,”  namely life  as  we  know   it—shaped  by  biopolitics. At  this  point, Arakawa and  Gins  would submit applications to  the  regulatory agencies  that would permit volunteers to  obtain   Bioscleave  Houses independently. Finally, during Post Marketing Surveillance Trials (i.e., Phase  IV), the label would be expanded to incorporate additional evidence for the Bioscleave  House efficacy in individuals not  included in  the  population for  which   Bioscleave  House was originally approved for marketing.
