Bioscleave  House is how  we can extend life throughout our  species  and  make  it worth living  in the  process,  namely, how  we can live longer  by living  younger! Actually, the process  is not new: it is probably responsible for many  of the traits that  have  evolved over  the  millennia, including our  present relatively long  life. Juvenilisation, known in  the  evolutionary literature  as  D“neoteny” (from  the Greek  meaning stretching, extending or holding onto)  refers  to the  retention of juvenile  morphology into  adult stages  of the  lifetime,  and  hence  the  delay  of aging.
