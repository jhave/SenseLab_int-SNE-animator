Several   important  points  emerge  from   seeing   the   four   data-based  curves together: The first point  is that the four curves  follow a similar  pattern in which  a more  or less horizontal arm  meets  a more  or less vertical  arm.  The second point is that  the  more  or less  horizontal arms  move  upward and  lengthen while  the more  or less vertical  arms  become  increasingly upright. The third point  is that the  “tails”  of the  four  curves  overlap (i.e., are entangled) as they  approach 0, at the  bottom of  the  graph. As  a  result,   the  shape   of  the  curves   changes from somewhat  rounder  on   the   left   to   somewhat  squarer  on   the   right.   Called “squaring  the  curve,”  biopoliticians  attribute  the  effect  to  improvements  in health care management.
