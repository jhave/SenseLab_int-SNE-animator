L. Steven  Coles,  co-founder of the  Los  Angeles  Gerontology Research  Group, created the  fifth  curve  in the  illustration (above)  by  untangling the  tails  of the survivorship curves  and  placing the  vertical  portionâ€™s point  of inflection at 150 years,  but  it could  be placed virtually anywhere along  the continuum. Steve has in  mind extending human lifetime   by  finding ways  of  expressing salubrious genetic  tendencies thereby promoting wellbeing and  longevity (personal communication),  but  he  also  shares   the  vision   of  the  creators  of  Bioscleave House.
