Bioscleave  House enhances wellbeing by activating and  exercising every  part  of the human organism constantly and  productively. By incorporating the contours of a terrain into the contours of an apartment, Bioscleave House flows into a landscape, between rooms,  even  within rooms,  producing an expansive effect in place of the prison cell of four walls and  doors.  The residents breath more  deeply as  their  horizon expands, exercise  their  whole  body  more  completely as  they move  in the interior terrain, and  encounter their  own  artistic  spirit  as they  break away  into the “exploratorian” from the quotidian.
