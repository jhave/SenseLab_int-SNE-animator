dead) assigns a “life expectancy at birth” value  to each cohort.  “Life expectancy at birth” is considered a cohort’s  mean  age  at death and  is used  as a basis  for statistical analysis and  comparison. Thus, the 42 and  47 years  life expectancies at birth  for the 1850 and  1900 cohorts are significantly greater than  the 24-year  life expectancy at birth  for the 1754 cohort,  and  the 75 years  life expectancy at birth for the  1988 cohort  is significantly greater than  the  life expectancies at birth  for the earlier  cohorts.
