The above  image  shows  five survivorship curves,  also known as human life expectancy curves,  tracing  the  percentage of individuals (‘survivors’) alive  in a cohort  as they  age (‘years after birth  ’). The four curves  toward the left are based on data  for people in the United States and  Europe, actuarial extrapolations, and smoothing algorithms. The one curve  at the right  is based  entirely on projections. The four  data-based curves  represent cohorts of individuals born  respectively in
1754, 1850, 1900, and  1988; the fifth curve  is for an entirely hypothetical cohort  of individuals to be born in 2025.
