This remembrance of being  scripted is the hard won  goal of diverse pedagogies in philosophy, science and  religion;  it is apparently quite  difficult  for humans to use language while  remaining aware of its limitations. Alan Watts suggested that  with  our  gift of the  logos,  humans often  mistake “the  menu for the  meal,”   and   Alfred   Korzybski sought  to  teach   that   “the   map   is  not  the territory.” Hence  to  paraphrase Robert  Anton   Wilson,  “plant intelligence is.... some  words”. [3] That  is, by  experimenting with  alternate scripts  (Schank  and Ableson) for  “plant” “behavior”, we  disrupt our  rhetorical habit  structure and become  slightly  more  aware of the limitations of any given  script.  From this perspective, Trewavas intervention  is  valuable precisely for  the  incredulity it may  inspire, incredulity that  should attend any  rhetorical articulation that  seeks to hang  static labels on the dynamic complexity of living systems.
