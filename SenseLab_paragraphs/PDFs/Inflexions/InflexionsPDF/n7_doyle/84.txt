and  the  sea's  salt  swell  laughed for joy. And  the  girl  was  amazed and  reached out  with  both  hands to  take  the  lovely  toy;  but  the wide-pathed earth  yawned there  in the plain  of Nysa,  and  the lord, Host  of Many,  with  his immortal horses  sprang out upon her -- the Son of Cronos, He who has many  names. (Evelyn-White 1914)
