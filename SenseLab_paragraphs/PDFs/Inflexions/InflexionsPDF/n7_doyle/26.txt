organ  of the  plant,  its root,  attaches it indissolubly to the  soil. If it be difficult  to discover among the  great  laws  that  oppress us  that which  weighs heaviest upon our  shoulders, in the case of the plant there  is no doubt: it is the law that  condemns it to immobility from its birth  to its death. (Maeterlinck: 10-11)
