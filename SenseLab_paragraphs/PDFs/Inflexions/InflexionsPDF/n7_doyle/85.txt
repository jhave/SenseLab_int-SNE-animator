Note  that  in this, the opening stanza of the hymn, all the action  centers  on a human/plant  interaction, with  Persephone herself  compared to a flower  as she gathers   flowers:    “the    bloom-like   girl.”    Already,   plant    and    human   are intertwingled. And  the flowers  themselves act as a “snare”, a “thing of awe”  that “amazed” Persephone, so  capturing her  attention that  she  sought to  pick  the “lovely  toy”  such  that,  perhaps, she  might  focus  further on  it. Indeed, on  this account  all  of  the  Greek   cosmos   had   their   attention captured  by  the  sweet smelling hundred blossoms: “all wide  heaven above  and  the whole  earth  and  the sea's  salt  swell  laughed for  joy.”  Laughter  is  a  response that   is  notoriously difficult   to  control;  the  cosmos  itself  could  not  but  rejoice  in  the  beauty and fragrance of the flowers.  It is hence these blooms’ capacity to attract and  “amaze” the  attention of not  only  insects,  but  the  gods  and  the  cosmos  itself,  which  is narrated here.  What  might  this  emphasis on the  attention focusing capacities of flowers  indicate for the rites and nature of Eleusis?
