The  persistent role  of plants in  the  Mysteries have  been  recognized by  many scholars in  diverse disciplines. As  Muller  wrote,  “it  was  thus  that  the  ancient Greeks  described the disappearance and  return of vegetable life in the alteration of the  seasons” (Muller,  cited  in Dudley Wright 2003: 31). And  by all accounts, the  myth   concerns Demeter's  plant   gift  to  humans –  corn  –  as  well  as  the knowledge  of  how   to   till  the   soil   in   focused  attention  and   human/plant interaction. More  recently, scholars and  scientists have  focused on  the  likely plant  composition of the  kykeon, a beverage described in  the  seventh century B.C. Hymn to Demeter, the only textual source  for the Mysteries.
