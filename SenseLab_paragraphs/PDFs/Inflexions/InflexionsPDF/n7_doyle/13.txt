I  need   hardly say  that  I  have  no  intention of  reviewing all  the proofs  of intelligence which  the plants give us. These proofs  are innumerable and  continual, especially among the flowers,  in which the effort of vegetable life towards light and  understanding is concentrated. (Maeterlinck 1907: 18)
