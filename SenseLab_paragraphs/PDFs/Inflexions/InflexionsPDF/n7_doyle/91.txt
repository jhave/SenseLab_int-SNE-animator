[1]  Plant   tropes  are   themselves  a  persistent  strategy  within  Frost's   poem: Beginning with  what  is commonly characterized as a “fork”  in a road,  we follow the  advice  of the  sage  Yogi Berra,  who  advises us that  “If you  see a fork  in the road, take it.” Unlike the Book of Genesis, which begins with the performative declarative “In  the  Beginning”, “Road  Not  Taken”  veritably “grows from  the middle  like  crabgrass”  (Deleuze  and   Guattari)  and   begins   with   an  already existing   multiplicity.  Here   Frost  is  closer  to  the  Kabbalistic tradition  of  the Elohim   and   “tree   of   life”   than    Genesis.    The   poem    thus    begins    with   a morphological characteristic of plants and,  turning to human consciousness for the first time, laments that it is not a plant  and  cannot,  unlike Cannabis Sativa, be sliced and  cloned,  and  “be one traveller”: Two roads  diverged in a yellow  wood, And  sorry  I could  not travel  both And  be one traveler, long I stood.  Note  too that the  very  background or  condition of  possibility of  this  divergence is  itself  a forest,   a  “yellow wood”,  a  prior   collective   of  plants   “in”  which   the  roads diverge. The narrator then  explores the very  limit of vision,  and  this limitation is itself framed visually, “bent” by plants:  “And  looked  down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth.”
