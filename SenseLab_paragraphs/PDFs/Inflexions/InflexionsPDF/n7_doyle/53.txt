Certainly, experiments with  different rhetorical softwares (Doyle 1997) or “metaprograms”  (Lilly  1964)  such  as  “plant  intelligence” are  likely  to  prove useful  for differentially organizing the complexity presented by plants and  other living  systems for the attention of primate researchers. Metaphors and  other rhetorical strategies appear to be useful  devices  for such  primate knowledge prospecting  precisely to  the  extent   that   participants  treat   them   as  tools  and heuristics rather than  ontologies. “Plant  intelligence” itself may  not be up  to the task  of shifting researcher attention and  perception, constrained as it is by  the very  history that  reduced multiple intelligences (Gardner 2006) in  primates to those   which   most   closely  matched  the  premises  of  a  subculture  of  primate
