Although this  classification was  sensibly designed to  bring  order out  of chaos,  it  had  one  major  drawback. Division into  just  four types  implied a limited diversity and perhaps a lack of specificity in the mechanism of protein dephosphorylation. Consequently, investigators  have   tended  to   concentrate  attention  on   protein kinases  where, it was surmised, all the action  was to be found. (Trewavas 1999)
