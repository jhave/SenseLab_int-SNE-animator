The plant-soul (phytopsyche) is, in our  view,  the  summary of the entire  psychic  activity  of the tissue-forming, multicellular plant  (the metaphyton, as distinct from the unicellular protophyton); it is, however,  the  subject   of  the  most   diverse  opinions  even   at  the present day . . .
