...the contraction of the muscles of vegetables seems  to depend on a disagreeable  sensation  in   some   distant  part,   and   not   on   the irritation  of  the   muscles  themselves  .  .  .  which   evinces   that vegetables  are  endued with   sensation,  or  that   each  bud   has  a common censorium, and  is furnished with  a brain  or a central  place where its nerves  are connected. (Darwin 1825: 51)
