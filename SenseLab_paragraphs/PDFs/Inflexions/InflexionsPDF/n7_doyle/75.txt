Demeter came  [to Eleusius] seeking  her  daughter Persephone who had  been  carried by Hades (Pluto).  The King gave  Demeter hospitality, and   in  gratitude she  presented his  son  Triptolemus with  the first grain  of corn  and  taught him  how  to till the soil. The grief of Demeter over the abduction of her daughter symbolizes the mourning of nature over  the death of the plants in winter, and  the return  of  Persephone  symbolizes  the   springing  up   of  growing things  after the months of death. (Finegan 1992, 143)
