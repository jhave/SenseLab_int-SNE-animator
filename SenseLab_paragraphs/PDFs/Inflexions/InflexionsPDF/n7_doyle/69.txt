Existential intelligence . . . involves having a heightened capacity to appreciate and  attend to the  cosmological enigmas that  define  the human condition, an  exceptional awareness of  the  metaphysical, ontological,   and    epistemological  mysteries   that    have    been   a perennial concern  for people of all cultures."
