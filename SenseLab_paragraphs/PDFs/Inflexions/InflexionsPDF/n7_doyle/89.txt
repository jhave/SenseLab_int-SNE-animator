And  while  much  remarkable recent  scholarship and  science focuses  on the exact identity of the plant  sacrament used  at Eleusis,  perhaps it is time  to refocus  our attention on  the  fact  of  a  plant   sacrament and  plant   manipulation of  human attention in  one  of our  foundational cultural narratives. More  recent  practices, such as those  of the UDV, a Brazilian  and  now legal American church devoted to a plant  sacrament of the Upper Amazon, points to the persistence of this troping of  and   reverence  for  plant   agency   and   teachings  even   in  the  post   modern, scientific  worldview. Recall that  for Cicero “indeed, in the Mysteries we perceive the  real  principles of life, and  learn not  only  to live  happily, but  to die  with  a fairer  hope” (italics  mine).  This  is existential intelligence indeed:  may  we  learn from, become  “moulded” and informed by, its teachers.
