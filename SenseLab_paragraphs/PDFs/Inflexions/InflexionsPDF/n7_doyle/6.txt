In a recent  article  in Annals of Botany, Anthony Trewavas offered  an “admittedly controversial” argument to shift  scientific  (botanical) rhetoric toward “plant intelligence.  As  99  percent  of  biomass  of  the   earth,   plants  are   clearly   an evolutionary   “success”,  but   why    articulate  this   success    as   "intelligence"? Trewavas argues that such a vocabulary would help guide future research to less noticed  aspects  of  plant   signal   transduction,  whose   complexity continues  to unfold  as   researchers  discover  ever   more   subtle   interactions  between  the “external” environment (e.g. wind)  and  the “internal” milieu  of plant  signal transduction (e.g. Calcium ions).  This emerging research also suggests a convergence upsetting the taxonomical distinction between plant  and animal:
