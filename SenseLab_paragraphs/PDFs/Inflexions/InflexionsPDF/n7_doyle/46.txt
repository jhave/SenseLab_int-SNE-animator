It  exerts  itself  wholly   with  one  object:  to  escape  above  from  the fatality  below,  to evade,  to transgress the heavy  and  sombre law, to set  itself  free,  to  shatter the  narrow sphere, to  invent or  invoke wings,  to  escape  as  far  as  it  can,  to  conquer the  space  in  which destiny encloses  it, to approach another kingdom, to penetrate into a moving and active world. (Maeterlinck 1907: 12)
