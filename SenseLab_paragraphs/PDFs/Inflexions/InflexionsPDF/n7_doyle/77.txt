Much  that  is excellent  and  divine does  Athens seem  to me to have produced and   added to  our  life,  but  nothing better   than   those Mysteries by which  we are formed and  moulded from  a rude and savage  state of humanity; and,  indeed, in the Mysteries we perceive the real principles of life, and  learn  not only  to live happily, but  to die with a fairer hope.‚Äù (Thackara 1978)
