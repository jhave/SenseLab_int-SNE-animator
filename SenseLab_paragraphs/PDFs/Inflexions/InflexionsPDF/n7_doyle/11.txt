Although we understand much  more  about  signal  transduction processes in plants than  we  did  20 years  ago,  there  is a long  road yet  to  travel,   to  jump   the  gap   between  cell,  tissue   and   whole organism.  In   this   article   I  have   travelled  Robert   Frost’s   ‘less travelled road’. My hope  is that,  in future, this may become  a more major highway. (Trewavas 2003: 17)
