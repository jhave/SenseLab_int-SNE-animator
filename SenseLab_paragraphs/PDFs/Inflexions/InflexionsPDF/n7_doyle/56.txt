Finally,   the   author,  during  the   preparation  of  this   article,   has become  very  aware that  human language guides and  greatly limits our thoughts when trying to appreciate the functioning of plants. It might  ultimately be unproductive to debate whether a plant  has memory, whether a plant  can learn or whether a plant  can possess a spatial map,  because the key terms  come  from  an organism that  is highly  individual, an organism that  finds  it hard to appreciate the faculties   of  organisms  that   lack  individuality  and   all  that   that implies. Our  language lacks  appropriate words. However, if new words  are  needed  to  describe  how   plants  function, maybe   we should invent new ones rather than  trying to redefine existing  ones (Firn 2004, 34).
