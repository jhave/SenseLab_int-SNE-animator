The  character of the  tissue-soul reveals  itself  in  the  same  way  in both  cases...When the  sensitive mimosa closes  its  graceful leaves and   droops its  stalk   at  contact,   or  on  being   shaken; when  the irritable fly-trap (the dionaea) swiftly  clasps  its leaves  together at a touch,  and  captures a fly; the sensation seems  to be keener,  the transmission of the  stimulus more  rapid, and  the  movement more energetic than  in  the  reflex  action  of the  stimulated bath-sponge and many  other  sponges. (Haeckl  1901: 159)
