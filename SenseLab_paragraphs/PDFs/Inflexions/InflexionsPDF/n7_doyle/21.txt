As  Elizabeth  Wilson   makes   clear  in  her  Psychosoma, such   relations between psyche  and  soma  (Fechner's “Psychophysik”) proceed less  through separation than  involution; like  Haeckel's famous embryos, they  develop or  “unfold” as much  as they “separate”. Different modalities for modeling the relations between body  and  mind enable  and  manifest different experiences and  actualizations of body/mind. Wilson  looks to the “gut” as a site for observing this nexus  at work
