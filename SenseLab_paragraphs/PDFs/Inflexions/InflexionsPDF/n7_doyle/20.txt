Modern comparative physiology has  shown that  the  physiological attitude towards various stimuli (light,  heat,  electricity, gravity, friction,  chemical action,  etc.) of the  " sensitive " portions of many plants  and   animals  is   exactly   the   same,   and   that   the   reflex movements which  the stimuli elicit take place in precisely the same manner on both  sides.  . . these  mechanical causes  are neither more nor less psychophysical than  the similar  " reflex movements " of the sponges, polyps, and  other  nerveless metazoa, even though their mechanism is entirely different. (Haeckel  1901: 158)
