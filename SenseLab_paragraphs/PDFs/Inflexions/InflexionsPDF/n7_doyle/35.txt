This “incredulity”, though, would seem  to indicate less about  Bose's material – recognizably in  the  tradition of  Haeckel,   Fechner   and   Erasmus Darwin, and written by  an  already well  established scientist – than  about  readers of Bose's texts.   In other  words, incredulity is potentiated by forces outside the text, much as plant  signaling is now  recognizably intertwingled with  forces  “outside” the plant.
