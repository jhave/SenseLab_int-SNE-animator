Escaping  the  “maternal  shade”  of  static  meaning,  it  is  as  a  mechanism  for capturing and  moving attention that  Trewavas samples Frost,  and  here  too  he learns   from   the   plants,  whose    flowers,    Maeterlinck  notes,   function  as   a “spectacle”  capturing  insect   attention:  “And   the   energy  of  its   fixed   idea, mounting from  the darkness of the roots  to become  organized and  full blown  in the light of the flower,  is an incomparable spectacle” (Maeterlinck 1907: 14-15).
