Ayahuasca  has   been   for  me  both   a  scientific   and   professional continuing carrot,  and  a plant  teacher and  guide of incomparable wisdom, compassion, and  intelligence. My earliest  encounters with ayahuasca were  experiential; only  later  did  it become  an  object  of scientific  curiosity, sparked in  part  by  a desire  to  understand the mechanism, the machineries, that might  underlie the profound experiences that it elicited.
