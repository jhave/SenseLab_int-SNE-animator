researchers. For example: The coincidentally named Firn responded to Trewavas in the pages  of the Annals of Botany, questioning the propriety of the language of “intelligence” for “organisms that lack individuality.” While individuation (as distinct from  individuality) is a remarkable attribute of homo  sapiens as well as snowflakes, Firn's  phrasing seems  to transform a difference into a lack. Would a non-primate in a less individuating and  individualist ecosystem map  a field  of redwoods or  a single  sequoia as  lacking  individuality? Does  the  Great  Barrier Reef or the Great Red Spot of Jupiter  lack individuality? Thermodynamically speaking, all are dissipative structures seeking  to maximize entropy far from equilibrium, sometimes through individuation but  often  through mutualist, symbiotic evolution. Individuality is a trait,  and  one  (rightly) highly  valued by many,  but it is hardly “missing” from  a field of aspen any more  than  collectivity is wanting in a crowded urban street.
