others,  to mention, in passing, but  a few  of the  most  curious, the aerial  screw  or samara of the Maple;  the bract  of the Lime-tree; the flying-machine of the Thistle, the Dandelion and the Salsafy; the detonating springs of the Spurge;  the extraordinary squirt of the Momordica; the  hooks  of the  eriophilous plants;  and  a thousand other  unexpected and  astounding pieces  of mechanism; for there  is not,  so to speak,  a single  seed  but  has  invented for  its sole  use  a complete method of escaping from  the maternal shade.
