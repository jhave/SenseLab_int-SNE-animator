networked “postvital” paradigm of biology  understood as reductionist systems of  information  controlled  by  genes   (Doyle  1997,  2003).  Perhaps  predictably, though,  this  informatic reductionist  paradigm  is  on  the  decline,   with   more distributed  and   interactive  models  (such   as  plant   signaling)  on  the   ascent. Because  rhetorics of   “plant intelligence” and  its “networks” of signaling are  in many  ways  the artifacts  of this  historical paradigm of information, we risk once again   mistaking the  map   for  the  territory. Most  crucially, despite  the  ample evidence for the  entangled nature of plant  intelligence and  the  human psyche, the  rhetoric of “plant intelligence” risks  separating such  plant  intelligence from the human capacity to observe it, an epistemological error  that has troubled objectivist science since at least the early  20th  Century (cf. Barad  2007). It may  be that we must  further stoke our “incredulity” by taking  seriously the observations of researchers who  suggest “plant teacher” in intra-action with  human observers (Barad)   is  a  better   map   for  organizing  researcher  attention  in  the   densely interactive  chatter  of  plant   signaling  science.   In   an   unusually  courageous inclusion of subjective  experience in  a scientific  context  that  is often  hostile  to “subjectivity,”  Ethnobotanist  Dennis   McKenna,  whose   scientific   efforts   were instrumental in discovering the chemical action of ayahuasca, writes:
