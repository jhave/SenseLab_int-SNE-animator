Hence  Trewavas' remarkable contributions must  be contextualized by a history of botany and  plant  cultivation that  renders plants as deeply interconnected with psyche,  a task  I have  only  schematically begun here.  That  history, though, begs the  question: Why  has  plant  intelligence become  such  an  “admittedly controversial” topic  given  the  undeniable ecological  success  of plants and  the long history of phytopsyche? Perhaps, as with  Trewavas’ example of plant  signal transduction with  which  we began,  this controversy emerges out of the challenge of focusing   (primate) researcher attention on  the  differential temporality and scale  of  plant   intelligence, perceptual  factors   that   turn   discussions  of  plant intelligence  into   recipes   for  incredulity  or  “controversy”.  Early   20th   century wireless pioneer J.C. Bose wrote extensively concerning plant  feeling,  prompting one  commentator to  complain of a rhetorical barrier separating Bose from  the “non-scientific reader”:
