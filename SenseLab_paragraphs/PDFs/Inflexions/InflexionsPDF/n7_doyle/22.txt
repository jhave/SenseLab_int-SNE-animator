in  contemporary psychology, where the  “second brain’  discovered within the stomach is often  repressed and  certainly not  expressed, contributing to a wide range  of “psychosomatic” symptoms for both  psychology and  its patients. The continuity Haeckel  reveals  in nature is a mechanical one, a continuous relation of moving parts  in a kind  of Rube Goldberg vision  of nature (Oyama). But the great machinic phyla  modeled by Haeckel,  Fechner  and  Maeterinck were  veritably composed of unity;  the “whole” remained the main  ingredient, as it were,  of any living  reality,  even  as  living  systems were  increasingly modeled as  machines. This  mechanical monism  was  also  a  pan   psychism:  Haeckel's  contemporary Fechner   invents a  science  of  perception that  seeks  to  make  measurement the central    activity    of   his   new    discipline,   psychophysics,   and    this   scientific psychology yielded less  alienation than  a cosmic  gnosis.  As  the  historian and psychologist Edwin Boring argues in his introduction to Fechner's Elements of Psychophysics,  “Consciousness,  Fechner   argued,  is  in   all   and   through  all” (Fechner  1996: xiii).  Even in plants this unity  is ascertained through a ubiquitous movement:
