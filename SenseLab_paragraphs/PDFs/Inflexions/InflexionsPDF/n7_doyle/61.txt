In  the  city  of  Iquitos   and  its  vicinity   there  is  even  today a  rich tradition of folk medicine. Practitioners, some  of whom qualify  as shamans, make   an  important  contribution to  the  psychosomatic health of the  inhabitants of this  area.  Among them  there  are those called vegetalistas or plant  specialists and who use a series of plants called  doctores or plant  teachers. It is their  belief that  if they  fulfill certain  conditions of isolation and  follow  a prescribed diet,  these plants are able to "teach" them  how  to diagnose and  cure  illnesses, how   to  perform  other   shamanic  tasks,   usually  through  magic melodies or icaros, and how to use medicinal plants.
