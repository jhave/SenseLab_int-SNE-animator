The great  13th  century Mongol  emperor Kublai  Khan built  his summer capital in  what   is  now  known as  Inner  Mongolia, about   350km  north of  modern Beijing.  This  city  of  100,000  people  was  famously  visited  in  1275  by  the venetian traveller Marco Polo who  by citing gilded palaces,  beautiful gardens and  exotic wildlife implanted forever  in our  minds the image  of Xanadu as a fantastic and luxurious place.
