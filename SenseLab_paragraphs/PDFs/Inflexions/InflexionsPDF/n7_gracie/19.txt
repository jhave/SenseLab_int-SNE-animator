The word diorama comes  from  the  Greek  “through that  which  is seen,”  and was  first  employed by  one  of  the  fathers of  photography Louis-Jacques- Mandé Daguerre. “Through that  which  is seen”  – it suggests a similar  process or thinking philosophy as experiment, a “trial”  or a “proof.” We create a thing or  a process  to  enable  us  to  see  what  was  previously unknown or  unseen. These    Xanadu  dioramas   are   experiments  in   visualising   extraordinary situations under extraordinary circumstances.
