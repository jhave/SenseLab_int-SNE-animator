As  a  consequence  of  descriptions  such   as  these   Xanadu  has  become,   in modern language, a metaphor for splendor and  opulence, and  has  appeared as  a  concept   in  popular  culture in  many   guises.   From  pop  music  rogues Frankie  Goes  to  Hollywood in  “Welcome to  the  Pleasure Dome”  (1984) to science  fiction  in Ray  Bradbury's  “A Miracle  of Rare  Device”  (1962). At the end  of the  20th   Century science  fiction  connected with  science  fact,  though sadly  too late  for Vonnegut's “Sirens  of Titan,”  and  a bright  area  spotted by Cassini   and   commonly  (but   mistakenly)  referred  to  as  a  “continent”  on Saturn's moon  Titan  was  officially  named Xanadu. Thanks to  the  ongoing Cassini  mission and  the Huygens lander we have  discovered that  Titan  is, in many   ways,  an  “Earth   like”  place,  with  a  thick  atmosphere, mountains, a liquid cycle,  lakes  and   rivers.   However, owing to  the  fact  that  the  mean temperature in this  place  is 190ºC below  zero  these  liquid features are liquid hydrocarbons like  ethane and  methane instead of water. A place  like  Earth then,  but  with  a climate  driven by liquid gasses,  with  mountains of rock ice, and with the possibility of a vast subsurface reservoir of water. Exotic indeed.
