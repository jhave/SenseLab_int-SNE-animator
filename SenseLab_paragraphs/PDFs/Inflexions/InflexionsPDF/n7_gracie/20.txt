One  the  one  hand, Xanadu_1 fits into  the  domain of hobbyist recreations of known places  and  landscapes, the  desire  to  recreate what  exists  in  perfect detail,  to allow an overview usually reserved for flight. On the other  hand it is a simulacrum, an image  without the substance or qualities of the original, distorted intentionally to make  it appear more  correct  in accordance with  the little we know  and  the lot we have  imagined. The piecing  together of a series of glimpses in  order to  describe a whole  for  which  we  have  no  direct  and detailed proof.
