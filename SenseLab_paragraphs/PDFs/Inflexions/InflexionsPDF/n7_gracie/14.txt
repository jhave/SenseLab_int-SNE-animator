Xanadu_1 – the first in this series  – was  made  as an overview, a visualisation of  a  4km   radius  around  the   location   in  which   Huygens  landed.  Dense atmospheric smog,  persistent rain  and  rivulets would be present, but  using water   in   liquid   form    and    ultrasonically  produced   vapours   at   room temperature this time.
