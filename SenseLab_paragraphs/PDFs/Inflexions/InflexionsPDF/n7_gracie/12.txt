Titan,   the   possibilities  of  life  there,   the   notion  of  terrestrial  life  forms colonizing it, the notion of exploration and  revelation of distant exotic places have  taken  root firmly  in my considerations of the science of astrobiology and its  expression  in  my   art   works.   While   developing  my   ongoing  project “Drosophila titanus”  I found myself  more  and  more  imagining the  reality  of this weird place,  its topology, its climate,  its exotic extreme cold hydrocarbon chemistry, the  sensation of cold  and  the  colour  of its  atmosphere. Xanadu filled my dreams as it had with  Coleridge over 200 years earlier.  It seemed not only correct but necessary to try and recreate this place in some way.
