Speculation about  Titan  is rife and  imaginations run  riot.  We see Titan  as a proto  Earth,  and  maybe  even  as a place  that  could  harbour an exotic form  of life. All the  necessary variables are  there,  in one  form  or other.  Speculation became  so heated in fact, and  the need  for concrete  data  so keen that  the ESA built  Huygens probe  that  flew  with  Cassini  was  landed on Xanadu in 2005. The intention was  that  the lander would survive long  enough to record data and  images   as  it  descended through the  thick  atmosphere. What  actually happened was that it survived the whole  trip and  landed softly on the “crème brûlée” surface  and  sat there  for 90 minutes taking  and  sending pictures of a world that  was  eerily  familiar. We  never  imagined we  would find  out  so much  about  the surface  of an alien world in such a short  time.
