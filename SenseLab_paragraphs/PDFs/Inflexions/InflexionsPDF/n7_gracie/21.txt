The future of the Xanadu project  ties in more  closely with  astrobiology experiments, and  more  specifically the  aspect  of the  field  which  deals  with planetary science â€“ the conditions and  environments found on extraterrestrial bodies.  These  systems are generally prescribed as test beds,  a place  in which we can observe on the  macro  scale events  and  occurrences on any  planet or moon  we choose.  Practicality triumphs over aesthetics, function over form. In Xanadu these  methods will be reappropriated to allow  for the aesthetics, the form,  to  shine  through. The  cryogenic Xanadu dioramas  will  allow  us  for fleeting  moments to catch another glimpse of the reality  of this environment, this few square kilometers of alien planet which  we have come to know.
