So Xanadu would be recreated in a series  of scale  dioramas from  obsessive attention to Cassini  and Huygens data,  the wealth of maps,  charts,  radar scans and  photographic images  at  our  disposal (and  whatever we  might  think  of NASA as an entity  we must  at least thank them  for making so much  material publicly available). Ultimately these  dioramas would recreate the exact same conditions as they  are found on Titan, with  cryogenic systems allowing temperatures low  enough to  allow  liquid methane and   the  formations of organic aerosols such as tholins.
