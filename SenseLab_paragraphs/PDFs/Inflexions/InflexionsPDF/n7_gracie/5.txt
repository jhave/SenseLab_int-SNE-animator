“And   when  you   have   ridden  three   days   from   the  city  last mentioned, between north-east and  north, you  come  to  a city called  Chandu, which   was  built   by  the  Khan  now   reigning. There  is at  this  place  a very  fine  marble palace,  the  rooms  of which  are  all gilt  and  painted with  figures  of men  and  beasts and  birds,  and  with  a variety of trees  and  flowers,  all executed with  such  exquisite art  that  you  regard them  with  delight and astonishment.”
