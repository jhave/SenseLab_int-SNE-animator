The ontology of generosity expressed in ascensionist thinking is not  without its own   limitations.  Primary  among  these   is  the   investment  in  an   affirmative ontology with  regard to the concept  of life (whether it be in terms  of genesis  or givenness). So much  is this  a veritable apriori of the ontology of generosity that in some  cases it tends  to become  a moral principle as well â€“ life is good  precisely because it is fecund, generous, bountiful and  gives  itself  forth.  We  must  have faith  in life, go with  the flow, endure our  life changes, learn  our  life lessons  and so  on.  And  we  as  human beings  become  dubiously romanticized within this bountiful flux and  flow resulting in a lyrical  and  therapeutic anthropomorphism of the  Absolute. In this  heady mix  of hippie-affectivism and  chaos  theory, the human expands to such  an extent  that  it eclipses  the  world itself, absorbing the nonhuman into its embrace, able to know  all and  to be all. And  here the ontology of  generosity inadvertently  reveals   its  therapeutic  function for  us  as  human beings,   which   is  to  conceive   of  life  in  such   a  way   that   the   life-for-us   is indistinguishable from life-itself.
