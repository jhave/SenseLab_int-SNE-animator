The ontology of generosity states,  firstly, that  all thought of life is conditioned by an ontological framework of overpresence. Life is generosity, genesis,  givenness; life is that  which  flows  forth  and  its overpresent in its fecundity. Secondly, the ontology of generosity states  that  all thought of life is conceptually dyadic, split between regional and  fundamental philosophy â€“ a split  whose  endpoint is the positing of an overpresent, overgenerous immanence between the  regional (the living) and the fundamental (Life).
