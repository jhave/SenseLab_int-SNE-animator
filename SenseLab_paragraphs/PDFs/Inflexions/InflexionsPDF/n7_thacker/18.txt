The  second form  of  ascensionism states  that  life is the world. This  is  the  near inverse  of  the  first  form.   Here   we  see  the  raising   of  life  as  the  privileged manifestation of metaphysical principles, such as time and  temporality, form and causality, or the  concepts of becoming, process  and  immanence. In philosophy, vitalism, mechanism and  pantheism might  be examples of this  second form  of ascensionism. In  science,  one  might   cite  certain   aspects of  biocomplexity and systems biology  as examples.
