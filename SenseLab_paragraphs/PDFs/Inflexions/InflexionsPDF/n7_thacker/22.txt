The  result  is that  the  ontology of generosity inherited from  German Idealism looks  to  be  a  compromised, weak   Kantianism and   the  same   can  be  said  of philosophical reflection on  life on  down to our  own  time,  whether it be in the form of speculative realism or object-oriented ontologies, eliminativism or accelerationism. The  question here  is whether there  are  any  alternatives to the ontology of generosity and  its ascensionist thinking – a form of thinking in which “life”  is always the  “life-for-us” as human beings.  But such  a question already sets us up  for a further failure  and  more  discourse. Another question is whether it is possible to have done  with the concept  of life altogether.
