Thus  post-Kantian philosophy challenges the  impasse that  Kant  had  proposed with  regards to the concept  of life. More specifically, German Idealism puts  forth an ontology of life as governed by a principle of flux and  flow that  runs  through the  world, cutting across  different material orders, from  the  microcosm to  the macrocosm. This is what  we can call the ontology of generosity.
