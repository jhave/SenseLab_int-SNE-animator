This problem is already found in Aristotle’s De anima. While we can point  to this or  that   particular form   of  life,  such   an  act  and   the  boundary it  establishes between the  living  and  the  non-living presumes a prior  concept  of “life  itself” that  would be  common to  every  particular  instance of  the  living.  This  prior concept   – “Life”  – is  thus  logically  necessary in  order to  be  able  to  identify, describe and  explain this or that  form of life – “the living.”  Without it, one enters the muddy waters of relativism in which  any  and  everything is alive  (as well as its dark  inverse – that nothing is alive).
