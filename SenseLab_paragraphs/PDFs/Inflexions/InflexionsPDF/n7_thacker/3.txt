The concept  of “life” has a privileged but ambivalent position within philosophy. On  the  one  hand, “life”  is the  topic  of regional philosophies whether it be the philosophy of biology,  where life is understood in terms  of the  life sciences,  or whether it  be  in  ethical  philosophy, where life  is  understood in  terms  of  the qualified life of the human being. But “life” is not just something that philosophy meditates on  as  an  object  of  study, for  philosophy itself  is  living  thought, a dynamic way  of thinking and  being  in the world. There  is not only a thought of life but  a life of thought as well.  From  Aristotle to Descartes to Kant,  one  can witness this  twofold aspect  of life in relation to philosophy. Life is that  which philosophy  thinks about,   as  a  subject   an  object,  and   life  is  also  that   which conditions the very possibility of philosophy.
