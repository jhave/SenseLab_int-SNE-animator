These  paths – life as genesis  and  life as givenness – are  not  exclusive to post- Kantian philosophy;  they  are  very  much  alive  today. In  the  notion of life-as- genesis  we can detect  the participation of philosophies of becoming, process philosophy   and    biophilosophies  inspired   by   thinkers   such    as   Bergson, Whitehead and  Deleuze. In the notion of life-as-givenness we can likewise  detect the   participation  of  phenomenology  and   philosophies  of  affect  inspired  by thinkers such as Edmund Husserl, Michel Henry and  Jean-Luc Marion.  The point here  is not to make  a historical argument and  suggest that  thinkers like Deleuze or Henry are working in the tradition of German Idealism. Rather,  it is to suggest that   these   are  the  contours  of  thinking  about   life  that   cut  across   disparate traditions, methods and schools of thought.
