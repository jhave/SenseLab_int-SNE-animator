Hence,  this  metaphysical necessity, this  principle of life – the distinction between Life and  the living – which  then  opens  onto various boundaries of articulation – the living  vs. the non-living, the natural vs. the artificial,  the human vs. the animal, and  so on. Taken together, the principle of life and  the boundaries of articulation constitute an entire  ontology of life, one that enables philosophy to think  life both in its regional aspects (e.g. philosophy of biology,  ethical  philosophy) as well as in its fundamental aspects (the logical necessity of the Life-living  distinction).
