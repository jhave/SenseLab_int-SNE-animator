Both  forms   of  ascensionism  are  readily present  in  post-Kantian  philosophy. Indeed,  they   imply   one   another.  For   instance,  Hegel’s   comments  on   the organicist “life of the  Absolute” in the  Phenomenology of Spirit are  linked  to his study of living  organisms in  the  Philosophy of Nature.  Kant  himself  engages in ascensionist thinking when,  for instance, he states  that  the  principle of order in the world must  be sought for in the “analogue of Life” in which  life serves  as the model  for the ordered and purposive character of the world as a whole.
