The first  form  of ascensionism states  that  the world is alive. By this  is meant the process  by which  the concrete  is raised  to the abstract. Thus  the concrete  notion of life as defined within natural philosophy or life science is raised  and  expanded so  as  to  describe  the  world  itself.  One  begins   with   the  individuated living organism and  scales  it up  to  the  planetary level.  In the  history of philosophy, animism, panpsychism and  certain  strands of phenomenology are  examples of this  first  form  of ascensionism. In science,  a well-known example might  be the Gaia hypothesis as well as certain  aspects of deep  ecology.
