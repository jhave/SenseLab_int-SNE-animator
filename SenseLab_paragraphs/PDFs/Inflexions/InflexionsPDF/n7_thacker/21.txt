There is a sense in which  philosophical reflection on life must  always fail, if only because we  as human beings  seem  peculiarly ill-fated  to think  life, and  therein lies   the   minimal  distance,  the   smallest  interval  that   reveals   contradictions between  "Life"  and   "the  living",  the  principle  of  life  and   the  boundaries  of articulation. Thus,  while  German Idealism provides a solution to the Kantian problematic, that solution often ends  up being compromised by the Kantian framework itself.  There  is,  for  instance, the  problem of  causality. Within   the ontology of generosity, one must  still posit  a source  of life even  if this  source  is self-caused  or  self-generating.  There   is  also  the   problem  of  teleology.  This positing of a life-source necessitates the positing of an end or purpose in order to qualify  and  to justify  the  organization inherent in life â€“ order demands an end. This  is  true   even   if  the  end   one  posits   is  the  process   of  process   itself,  the becoming of becoming itself. The positing of a source  and  end  dovetail into  the need  to accept a distinction between source  and  end and  this is still the case even if one asserts  an immanent relation between source  and end.
