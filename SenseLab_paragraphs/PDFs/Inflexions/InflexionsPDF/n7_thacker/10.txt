This is, in short,  another name  for the Absolute in German Idealism and  it relies on a notion of Life that  is superlative with  respect to the living.  It takes  different forms,  however. In the early  Hegel,  the organicist model  of the dialectic,  moving across nature, logic and  history is described as the “life of the Absolute” or, more simply, “the  life  of Spirit.”  For  Schelling,  whose  work  is  deeply informed by natural philosophy, nature is understood as a continuous flux and  flow between the  manifestation of this  or  that  living  being,  and  the  living  being  in  itself  as evidence  of  the   background  flux  and   flow   of  Life.  This  is  what   Schelling describes as the  “absolute life of all things.” Even  Fichte,  who  is otherwise not given  to speculation on nature and  life, repeatedly returns to the  philosophical motif    whereby   an   abstract   logical    principle  is   common   to   each   of   its manifestations, connecting self and  world, I and  not-I  –a phenomena he  terms “absolute life.”
