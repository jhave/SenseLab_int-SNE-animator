Finally,  the ontology of generosity usually expresses itself via one of two  paths. The  first  is  that   of  life-as-genesis,  in  which   life  is  thought  in  terms   of  its generativity, as becoming, process,  and  genesis.  If, in traditional metaphysics one asks  “why is there  something and  not  nothing?”, here  one  asks  “why is there something new?”  The  second path  is that  of life-as-givenness, in  which  life is thought in terms  of gift, of being  given,  of donation. Here  life is an affirmation that  is  already given  to  us,  an  affirmation prior  to  all  being  and  prior  to  all becoming. Here  the  question is not  “why is there  something new?”  but  instead “why is there  already something?”
