AS: Your films often  have  a diary  feel to them;  there's a very  personal aspect  to your  films.  Especially in viewing Picture of Light, I get  the  impression of really being  with  you  and  the crew.  In Petropolis, your  presence is especially felt at the end  of the  film. I think  it's after  30 or 35 minutes that  your  voiceover comes  in. How  do you negotiate your  own presence within the film and  is there  something about  the tar sands and  your  position from the helicopter that  made  you want  to create a certain  distance between the visuals  and your  personal voiceover?
