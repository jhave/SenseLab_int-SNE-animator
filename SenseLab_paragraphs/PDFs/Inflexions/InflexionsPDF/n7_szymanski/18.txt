AS: In Petropolis, as you mention, there  is a dual  focus on the infinitely large  and the  infinitely small.  I got  this  impression when watching the  film because even though you're filming  from an aerial, objective, point  of view there  is always some fragment of movement, or part  of the geographical landscape, that  is outside the frame.  So on the  one hand, you  are zoomed out  to the  max,  in a helicopter and you're taking  this  aerial  footage,  but  at the  same  time  it never  entirely captures what   is  going   on  because  the  tar  sands  are  so  big,  the  project's  totality  is constantly beyond the frame,  beyond the bounds of an intelligible image.  I think this dawned on me when watching the film because there  is so much  movement in the camera work.  The camera is constantly moving along  with  the helicopter and  so the way  that  the editing works  is that  it is constantly piecing  together the different parts  of the  tar-to-oil production  process  like  the  mining pit,  the  oil refinery, etc. Is that  something you  see in your  own  film where on the one hand it  is  capturing something that  is  infinitely big  but  at  the  same  time  what   is captured still seems to be too small?
