PM: Yes. I think  that  ultimately, in Petropolis, it just didn't seem  necessary to say anything. But at the same time I wanted to wrap it up at a certain  point  and make an  allusion to evolution and  perspective. I had  done  a cut  of the  film  that  was wall-to-wall voiceover because I had  read  an extensive book depicting what  goes on   in   the   tar   sands  and   the   ramifications  of  our   consumer  lifestyle   and government's policies.  What  this  operation signified was  really  eye opening. So my first inclination was  to try and  get that  information into  the film. But it was too  much   information and  the  information is  already  available. One,  by  any number of books and  also through the website that Greenpeace put  together, and lots of other  places. And there's other  films that deal with it.
