PM: Yes, which  is the nature of perception itself. You can only see what  you  are looking  at. And  then you try to look at as many  things as possible to create as big of picture as possible but  you're always limited to what  you  are looking at and how  you are looking  at it. In Petropolis I consciously wanted to show  the expanse of the  place  and  that  there  was  more  outside the  frame  than  was  visible.  To encourage that, partially, by having long takes so that it could  be understand that when moving from  here  to here  to here  to here,  it is possible to see the  whole continuum, that   whole   set  of  relationships,  whereas  if  there   was  a  cut,  the continuum wouldn't be understood in the  same  way.  If that  trajectory is made visible,  it's  understood that  there  are  many  more  trajectories over  there  on  the
