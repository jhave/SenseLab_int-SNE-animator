oil,  that's  fuelling most  of our  technology today. It's  a paradox because oil  is fuelling the  helicopter, oil produced the  videotape and  all these  things that  are enabling us to see that  aerial  perspective. I want  to see as far as I can with  the technology that's  available. There  is an  innate curiosity to look  further and  see more  and  understand more,  and  that's  what's propelling it: to see more  and  thus better  understand our relationships.
