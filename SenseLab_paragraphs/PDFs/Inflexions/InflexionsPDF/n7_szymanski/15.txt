AS: Much  of your  cinematography is double mediated by  technology in  some way.  For example, in Picture of Light there's that  sequence where there's the contraption that  you've set up to leave outside and  capture the northern lights  in a way  that  no human cinematographer could,  since  no one  could  ever  actually stand outside with  a camera for that  long.  In this  instance, it's the  camera on a specially designed mount, and  in Petropolis the camera is remote controlled and attached to the bottom of a helicopter. Where  does the impetus to perceive things that the human eye can't perceive come from?
