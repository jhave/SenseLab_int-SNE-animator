PM: That's  the gist of the idea  of the word 'perspective'. Also, there's the double play  on  the  word perspective at  work,  like  to  have  a perspective that  tries  to illuminate something about  the  repercussions of our  lifestyle  by the  use  of this product that  they're digging up  out  of the  ground. So that's  'perspective' as an idea.  But  at  the  same  time  it's  a  visual   perspective which   is  created just  by standing  back  or  rising   up.  Petropolis is  like  a  conscious  play   on  the  word perspective.
