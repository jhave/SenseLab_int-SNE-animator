PM: I think  it's almost  my modus operandi. Relativity and  association – where we stand in respect to the  infinitely small  and  the  infinitely large  – is important to my work.  An astronomer whose  name  I forget,  he put  it like this: that  the human in terms  of size proportion is exactly  half way  between the atom  and  the stars  in the universe, or something like that. That in proportion, we are in the middle of it all. It's certainly interesting to think  about.
