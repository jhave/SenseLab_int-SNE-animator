AS: Continuing on about  aerial  perspective, how  do you  see it connecting to the political  implications of the  film in terms  of trying to raise  consciousness about the  tar  sands' contribution to environmental degradation? Is there  a connection between  having  an   aerial   perspective  of  an   event   and   giving   people  an opportunity for  reflection or  self-critique in  relation to  the  process   going  on below that wouldn't otherwise be accessible  from another perspective?
