AS:   And    that's    the   strength  of   your    film,   because  I've   seen   plenty  of environmental  documentaries  and   whether  they're  about   water,  oil, deforestation, or some  other  topic,  they  often  have  this  very  didactic approach where you get the impression that  the film posits  a viewer that  has absolutely no previous knowledge of the  topic  being  presented. I don't often  think  that's  the case with  these  sorts  of activist  films because you're not going  to stumble into in a megaplex movie  theatre by accident and  see them.  There is little to no publicity urging the public  to go see them.  A film of this type is usually something that has been  sought out  at a public  library,  cinemath√®que, public  institution or activist event.
