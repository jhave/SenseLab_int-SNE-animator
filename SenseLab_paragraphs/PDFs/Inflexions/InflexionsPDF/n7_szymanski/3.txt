Peter Mettler's work  raises more questions than  it answers, this is his documentary  mode.   It  makes   for  a  singular  blend   of  scientific,   social   and personal  inquiry  coupled  with   an   attitude  of  open   curiosity  towards  the workings of the world. For this reason,  Mettler's approach to filmmaking can be read   in  contradistinction  to  a  pervasive 'expository' tendency within documentary filmmaking that insists  on the communicative totality of a given  set of (political)  circumstances. By this,  I am  referring to the  framing of a political situation's complexity so that it neatly  coheres  with  filmic and  pedagogical forms
– forms  that  when mutually standardized, lend  themselves to one another. Pre- established, standardized  film  form,  meaning an  approach to  constructing the visual  organization of a given  film  that  is divorced from  immersion within the political  circumstances being communicated (separation of form [of the film] and content [of  the  political   situation]). Pre-established, standardized  pedagogical form,  meaning a didacticism that  rests  on the  transfer of important information from  the  filmmaker (posited as knowledge-bearing) to the  audience (posited as in need  of a lesson). Often, film form and  pedagogical form coalesce towards this expository pole  of documentary  filmmaking resulting in  a  number of generic tropes:  the talking head  expert,  the authoritative voiceover of a 'respectable' and well-known person who  lends  their  voice to ‘the cause’ of the documentary, and a patchwork of footage  assembled after-the-fact in order to dramatize the  event through the  foregrounding of  ‘significant’  moments abstracted out  from  their lived   duration  and   relationality.  While   the  message  of  these   films   is  often
