PM: In the  case of the  northern lights  [the  focus  of Picture of Light] it's obvious they are up in space and  it's the result  of the sun's  rays that  react with  the Earth's magnetic field  in order to create  light,  like in a fluorescent tube.  And  so again, there's this very  specific  reason for going  there.  And  then  in The End of Time, it's the idea  of travelling light,  of the beginning of the universe, of the Big Bang and how  far we can look into  time  via looking  into  outer  space.  So in fact, there  is a specific reason for showing what  I do in each film.
