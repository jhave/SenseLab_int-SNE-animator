Unlike  many  activist  documentaries, Petropolis doesn't really  feel the need  to fill people in on things they might  already have  known. I think  it really stands alone as a film that  works  on its own  terms;  not solely  as a piece of green  propaganda or as an educational film you  show  in classrooms to teach  people about  the  tar sounds, but  as a meditation on film's  place  in resolving the  ecological  crises  we face.
