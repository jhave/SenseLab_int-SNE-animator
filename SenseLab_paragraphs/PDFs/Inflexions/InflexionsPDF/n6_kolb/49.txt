Inserting bits  of Arakawa and  Gins  designs into  already built  ordinary spaces would parallel the way Le Corbusier and  other  early modernist architects moved into interior design, furniture, and  accessories, thus  affecting  public  taste and encouraging new  behaviors. It is not  accidental that  the classic modernists such as  Le Corbusier, Frank  Lloyd  Wright, and  Mies  van  der  Rohe  strove  for  total control  of oneâ€™s environment. What  seemed dictatorial was  part  of their  effort to change social norms.
