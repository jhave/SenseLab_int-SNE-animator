So far Arakawa and  Gins have  avoided such  commodification. Yet this depends on their works  being full size and immersive. It’s not then clear whether the wide distribution of their  work  is possible, given  the  realities of the  art market. They have  escaped the art market into the world of building, but there  the cost factors rise  so steeply that  it is difficult  for their  work  to have  the  kind  of widespread effect they  hope  for. Trying  to make  their  work  have  a wider effect, they  share the  modernist dream of  becoming architectural dictators, as  in  their  “making dying illegal” project.
