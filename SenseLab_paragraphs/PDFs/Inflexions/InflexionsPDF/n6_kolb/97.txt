Panel  7.3 of the Mechanism of Meaning [22] states  that  “a line is a crack.”  That is the  hope  that  the  kind  of interventions and  additions I am  suggesting would embody. That  they  would crack  open  the  familiar environment, the  habituated architectural surround. A  line  in  the  rug,  or  the  edge  of  a  mirror or  a  color boundary might  function as  a  disorienting and  ambiguous crack,  both  in  the invisible line isolating art works  and in the fabric of daily life.
