Would there  be ways  of adapting Arakawa and  Ginsâ€™s architectural procedures to  already existing   houses or  apartments? If  the  creation of  an  architectural surround with  their  necessary qualities demands completely new  construction, this  limits  their  possible impact and  puts  their  ideas  at the  mercy  of too  many external forces  and  institutions. Could   Arakawa and  Gins  bring  some  of  the qualities of their new constructions into already built environments? [21]
