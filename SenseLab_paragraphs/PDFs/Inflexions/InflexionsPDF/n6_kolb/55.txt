We could  apply this insight to systems of spatial organization. Hand someone a map  of Manhattan and  one of Chicago.  Tell them  to put  the maps  together. The task  seems  impossible but  might  provide new  insight as the  user  was  forced  to make  metaphorical connections between Manhattan’s rivers,  grid,  parks, Broadway, with  Chicago’s  lake,  river,  grid,  and  diagonal avenues. New  York’s difficult  address system  maps  onto  Chicago’s easy one. Manhattan’s boundaries at the rivers  could  be mapped to Chicago’s El tracks  or tiny streams. Conversely, Chicago’s expanse could  challenge Manhattan’s sense of itself as so distinct from Brooklyn  and Queens.
