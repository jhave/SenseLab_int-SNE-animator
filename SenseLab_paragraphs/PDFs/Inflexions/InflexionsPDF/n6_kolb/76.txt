Architects use  models to present their  designs. But with  a wooden model  it is difficult  to avoid  the  god’s-eye view  from  above.  Digital  models presented can show  on a screen  a model  of the building’s interior from different points of view. This can help.  But if the architect’s wooden model  is replaced by the digital fly- through, which  is literally disembodied, the  experience still  remains a kind  of omnipresence that  lacks precisely the kind  of physicality that  Arakawa and  Gins are  trying  to  influence.  The  screen   focuses   as  a  single   landing  site,  and   a computer mouse makes  all motion a flick of the wrist.  There is no effort, no need to reorient one’s body.
