They  closely  parallel the  demands made  by  Le Corbusier for  a new  mode  of building that would correspond to what  he saw as the dawning modern mode  of life [10]. In both cases the architect is attempting to redefine both how  one builds and  how  one  lives  in buildings. In his  rhetoric Le Corbusier says  that  the  new norms are  already present and  architecture needs  to catch  up  with  society  and industry. He exaggerates the change already happening; his examples of streamlined wonders show  more  a possible mode  of life than  real  new  social norms. But he was  right  that  economics and  industry were  pushing us into new modes of life.
