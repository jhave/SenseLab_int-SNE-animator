To achieve  its  goals,  Arakawa and  Gins’s  work  needs  to  influence the  public. Attempts to publicize the  work  using  traditional or  new  media are  important, but  they  can  undercut the  work’s  ability  to work  as it was  supposed to. What might  be done  to make  the work  available? Is there  a successful way to publicize an architecture designed to challenge the inhabitant’s body  and perception? How does one recreate a difficult  architectural surround in flat media?
