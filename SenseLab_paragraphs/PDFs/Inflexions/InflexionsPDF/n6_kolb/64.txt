Arakawa and  Gins  also  work  to increase  our  self-awareness [17]. While  I have been  interested  in  new   places   formed by  the  intersection  of  multiple social norms, they  have  been  examining our  bodily  inhabitation of space  independent of any particular social norms. They have  been trying to create  architectural environments where daily  living  would demand a new  awareness and  a new effort  at being  bodily.  Their  work  aims  at a level where every  place,  even  quite traditional and  ordinary ones,  could  be  lived  with  increased precision in  the processes of perceptual landing sites, movements, orientation and  disorientation that Arakawa and Gins study and try to provoke [18].
