Arakawa and  Gins have  tried  to find funding for buildings that  would prove  the effect  of  their   architectural surrounds  on  people  who   live  there   rather than visitors who  wander through them.  There  is a chicken  and  egg  problem when there  are no examples of people who  have  lived  in Arakawa and  Gins’ proposed environments. This lack of long-term examples requires them  to find other  ways to publicize the new  possibilities, and  to write  and  argue  to change social norms about  what  kind  of architecture is appropriate for today’s daily lives.
