In a book  and  website project,  Sprawling Places  [15], I argued that  the  familiar criteria  of authenticity and  hierarchy are no longer  adequate for judging and improving the networked and  multiply defined places  that  we are now  creating. Instead, I argued that  “complexity” was  the  appropriate criterion to  use.  This complexity shows  up  in the  multiple sets  of social  norms structuring the  same areas   of   space,   in   the   ongoing  and   often   conflictual interpretations and reconstructions  that   combine  space   and   social   life  across   time,   and   in  the multiple outside forces that  impinge upon our  places.  Such complexities already exist, and  they  can be increased by social changes and  conscious choices.  So, for instance, suburbia is already a more  complex place  than  appears from  its banal architecture  and   layout,  and   increasing  its  complexity would  make   it  more livable.
