Is there  a way  to  bring  activity  and  physicality into  a digital experience? The closest  we could  come, given  currently available technology, would probably be to use the graphic potential of digital games,  but arrange that oneâ€™s avatar would be less bouncy and  renewable than  in games.  Some difficulty and  fatigue factors could  be introduced, making motion less easy when there  were  slopes  or narrow spaces.  There could  be an enforced first-person point  of view, as in some shooter games,  where participants only see what  they  turn  their  head  to see, and  have  to choose  what  to concentrate on and  what  kind  of visual  landing sites to take note of,  so   that   the   surroundings  are   revealed  piece   by   piece,   perspective  by perspective.
