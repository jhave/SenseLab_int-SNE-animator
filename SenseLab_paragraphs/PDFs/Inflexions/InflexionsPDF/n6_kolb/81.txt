A web  page  is not  enough. A virtual world like Second  Life could  be a way  to make   a  digital  presentation  of  Arakawa  and   Gins’s   architecture. However Second  Life is also largely  disembodied. It is purely visual  and  it is not fully first person. That  is, the “camera” point  of view  floats  around a person’s avatar and can  be  made   to  back  off  and  see  what   is  behind and  above,  more  than   the embodied avatar’s limited cone of vision  could  include. There is also no sense  of difficulty dealing with  slopes  or  rough surfaces. In  addition, one  can  fly  and avoid  all the  surface  geometry. There  are  reasons for  these  features in  Second Life,  and   one  can  move   around inside   buildings, but  the  overall   effect  still reduces the experience of architecture to scenographic spectacle.
