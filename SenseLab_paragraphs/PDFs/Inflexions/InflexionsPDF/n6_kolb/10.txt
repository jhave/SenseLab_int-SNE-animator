An art museum customarily enforces  a very  ritualized relation of oneâ€™s body  to the  space  of the  building. One  walks  quietly through large  spaces.  There  are convenient  benches. One  looks.  Reads   labels.  And   looks.  The  contemplative stance  is normative; reverence rules. The art is removed from daily  life, to be experienced intensely, but at an aesthetic distance.
