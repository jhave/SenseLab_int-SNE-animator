One  tactic  employed by aspiring architects has  been  to use  museum exhibits  to achieve  status and  publicity. The 1932 exhibition of The International Style at the New  York Museum of Modern Art was crucial  in bringing new European modes of building to the United States. Later curators attempted to duplicate that  effect with    exhibitions   on   Postmodernism   and    on   Deconstructive   Architecture. Arakawa and  Gins have  had  their  own  dramatic and  successful museum shows, but  such  exhibits  have  an inherent defect: they  turn  their  work  into objects to be contemplated.  It  has  been  a  challenge  for  Arakawa and   Gins  to  escape   the museum and  build  environments for daily  living  in which  people will  actually live,  rather than  just  visit  to  see  a  curious possibility in  which  someone else might  someday live.
