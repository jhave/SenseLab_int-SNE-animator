[18]  Great   architects  may   challenge  perception,  but   they   do   not   all  try   to disorient. Often  they  try  to  make   one  feel  even  more   grounded and   clearly located.  Frank  Lloyd  Wright’s domestic architecture uses maneuvers with centralized  fireplaces and  enclosed spaces   to  increase   the  sense  of  being  “at home.”  In  this   connection  it  is  worth  remembering  that   Arakawa  came   to America to work  with Marcel Duchamp and Gins wrote radical poetry before she met   Arakawa.  Their   history  of  trying  to   upset  perceptions  and   question meanings began   earlier   than   their  architectural procedures and  their  goal  of extending life.
