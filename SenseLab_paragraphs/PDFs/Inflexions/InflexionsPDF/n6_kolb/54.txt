example if Romeo  says  “Juliet  is the  sun”  a whole  net  of associations with  the sun  now  get applied to Juliet: she is bright,  life giving,  she illuminates the world and  dispels the  dark,  she  would be dangerous to approach nakedly, she  could burn  you  if you  came  too  close, and  so on -- there  is no end  to the  things that could  be  elaborated out  from  the  central  metaphor. Each  shows  new  aspects; Romeo  can understand his relation to Juliet more  precisely by talking about something else metaphorically [14].
