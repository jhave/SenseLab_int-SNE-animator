In dealing with  simplified contemporary places  [16] we should work  to increase our  self-awareness of  the  multiplicity of  social  norms active  in  a  place,  and increase  our  participation in the  processes which  define  social  norms, and  take more  account of the  external forces  playing over  the  place.  We need  to inhabit more fully the social processes of our inhabitation of such places.
