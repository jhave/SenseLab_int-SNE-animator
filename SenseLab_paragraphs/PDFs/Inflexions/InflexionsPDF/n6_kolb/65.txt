I have  argued for increased self-awareness of the  social  complexities in contemporary places  even if they have  the most banal  architecture. Arakawa and Gins  have  been  trying to  create  a new  non-banal architecture that  demands a new  kind   of  bodily   awareness,  no  matter what   the  social  norms, simple   or complex, might  be.
