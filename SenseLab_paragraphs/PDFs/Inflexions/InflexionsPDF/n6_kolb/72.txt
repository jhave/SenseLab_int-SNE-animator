On the couch  watching the television, or at oneâ€™s desk  watching the monitor, the physicality of film  changes. Its influence becomes  less total.  Being closer  to the TV or monitor makes  the audience more  distant from  the film. Perhaps it is the ambient light  level  and  the  ease  of moving about.  Perhaps it is the  absence  of others   concentrating  together.  Home   viewing  has   then   rebounded  on   the theatrical experience, as people feel more  free to talk in the theater as they  might at home.
