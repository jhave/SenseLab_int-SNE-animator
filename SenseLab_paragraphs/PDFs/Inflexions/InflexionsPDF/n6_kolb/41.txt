Besides  making their  architecture more  available as surroundings for daily  life, there  also  would need  to be new  social  norms which  encouraged people to try living  their  daily  lives  in  such  “difficult” spaces.  Arakawa and  Gins  want  our lives, which  try to concentrate on their  aims and  rituals while  make  architectural surrounds a neutral background, are to be confronted by an architecture which will not let go, spaces  that demands self-conscious bodily  engagement and works procedures on  our  bodies  and  perceptions. For their  architecture to achieve  its desired  effects,  there   would have   to  be  a  combination  of  new   architectural surrounds available for daily  life plus  a social definition that  these  surroundings are for more  than  occasional stimulating adventures. In short,  it would take  not just new buildings but also changes in social norms to make  Arakawa and  Gins’s experiments more than  experimental.
