In the museum labels and  posters use art history to broaden the experience of the artworks. This  opens  a context  for the  artwork to relate  to other  artworks, but this is often a confined space and a safe horizon. Or at least it used  to be. Now  art history is breaking down barriers by relating artworks to social movements, revolutionary impulses, repressed feelings  and  desires, and  other  wider horizons that may scare the connoisseurs of comfortable history.
