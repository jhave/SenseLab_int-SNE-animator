An  apartment building or to a lesser  extent  a hotel  designed along  the  lines  of their  Mitaka  lofts in Japan  [7] or the Bioscleave  House on Long Island  [8] would be  places  socially  defined as  to  be  experienced in  the  activities of daily  living rather than  themselves being the focus of attention. But as yet Arakawa and  Gins have   produced  mostly   demonstration  projects,   experiments,  which   are   not socially defined as part  of ordinary daily lives.
