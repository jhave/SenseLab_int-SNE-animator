Arakawa  and   Gins  design  spaces   and   buildings  that   provide multiple and intersecting sets  of  horizons and  orientations. Each  pivots off  the  other;  their purpose includes but  goes beyond creating new  meaning; they  bring  you  to see the spaces  as richer  than  they seem at first, and by creating uncertainty they want to  force  more  precision in  the  ways   you  inhabit and  move  in  that  multiply structured space. This is not unlike the way metaphorical language in poetry can make   us  more   sensitive and   precise   about   using   the  echoes  and   systems of ordinary words.
