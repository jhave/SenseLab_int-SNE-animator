Some  digital presentations can  surround you  physically. A “Cave” uses  three wall-sized screens,  sensors to detect  bodily  motion, and  computers to alter  the images  on  the  huge  screens  in response to the  viewer’s  motion [20]. In such  a room  you  could  feel  you  are  inside  a  space  designed by  Arakawa and  Gins. Peripheral vision  and  the  ability  to walk  around and  see different views  would allow  some  of their  architectural procedures that  affect orientation and  horizon. But, however much  improved, the effect would still be mostly  visual.
