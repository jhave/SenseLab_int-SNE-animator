Panel  3.1 states  that  “everything is  ambiguous as  well  as  the  judgment  that something is ambiguous. As soon  as any fact is presented, ambiguity appears as the  zone  of alternate possibilities.” Phenomenology from  Husserl [23] to today has   insisted  that   for   anything  to   be  presented  as  meaningful  it  must   be surrounded by or appear against a horizon of related possibilities. The pen  on the  desk  is  meaningful because there  are  possible uses  of  the  pen  which  are present in our  habitual taking  up  the pen  as part  of a familiar world. We might read  panel  3.1 as reminding us of this fact.
