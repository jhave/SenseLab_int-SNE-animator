The problem of making an intervention into an ordinary room  resembles the problem of escaping the  museum. In order to  succeed they  would have  to  be more  than  artworks hanging quietly on the wall  or lying  demurely on the floor. They  would have  to  crack  open  the  subtle  borders that  frame  an  artwork as different from  ordinary life. The inhabitant must  abandon an attitude of contemplative distance. One  way  to force this  would to be intrusive, something you could  trip over, something you cannot  avoid  looking  at, something you have to detour around or sit awkwardly on or readjust your  body  to get by.
