Alvar  Aalto  started with  houses and  civic  buildings in  his  hometown. Frank Lloyd Wright developed his theories while building private homes  and churches. Much  earlier,  Palladioâ€™s villas became  archetypes for other  builders because they were  successfully built  for  rich  patrons, functioned well,  and  were  featured in perhaps the first architectural self-promotion book [4].
