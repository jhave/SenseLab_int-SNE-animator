Yet  it  is  true   that   in  recent   years   there   has  been   greater emphasis on healthy living,  on bodily  care and  training, and  more  willingness to try  unexpected and  “foreign” exercises  and  diets.  Feng  Shui  has  become  more prominent,  and   architects  are  becoming  more   attuned to  studies  in environmental psychology. People  are  more  accustomed to  the  idea  that  their architectural surrounds may  be influencing, for good  or bad,  their  body,  energy, and  physical possibilities, as well as their psychological well-being. Such changes may  make  people more  open  to new  social norms that  might  lead  to importing some aspects of Arakawa and Gins’s larger  designs into more ordinary spaces.
