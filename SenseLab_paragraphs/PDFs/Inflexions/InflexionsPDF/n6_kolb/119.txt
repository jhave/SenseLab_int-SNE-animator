[3] Louis  Kahn  said  “a work  of art … is not a living  thing  that  walks  or runs  … but  the  making of a life… you  know  it you  must  see  it again.” And,  “a  great building must  begin with  the unmeasurable, must  go through measurable means when it is being designed and in the end must  be unmeasurable” (Kahn 1991).
