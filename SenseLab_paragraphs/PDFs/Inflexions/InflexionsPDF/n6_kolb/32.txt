It is important to recognize the  way  social  norms govern our  engagement with architecture. We identify a building as for a certain  purpose. We act and  hold  our bodies  differently in  a courtroom or  a church than  in  our  living  room  or  at  a park.  Those  norms are  passed along  over  time,  and  they  can  change, though usually they change slowly.  For the most part,  these norms are taken  for granted, shaping the background for our activities.
