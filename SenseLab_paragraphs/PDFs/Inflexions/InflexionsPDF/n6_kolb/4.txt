Walter  Benjamin  argued that  architecture is experienced in a state  of distraction, because we concentrate not on the architecture but on the goals and  activities we pursue within it. Architecture tends  to  sink  into  the  background, a landscape behind the tasks  and  daily  rituals and  social norms that  are the hour-by-hour of living.
