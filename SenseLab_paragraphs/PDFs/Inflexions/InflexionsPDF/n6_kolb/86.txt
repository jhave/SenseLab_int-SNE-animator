Arakawa and  Gins’s  work  demands more  than  photos or a screening. Physical visits   are  needed,  but   shared  bus  trips   to  their   works   remain  visits   to  the museum. Perhaps what  would help  would be  to  have  samples of their  work inserted into people’s already built  daily  architectural surroundings -- not representations, but actual  samples.
