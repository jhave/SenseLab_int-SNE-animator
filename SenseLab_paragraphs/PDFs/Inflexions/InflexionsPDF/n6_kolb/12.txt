Putting art  at  the  service  of  life  to  transform life  has  been  a  goal  of  modern artists.  So removing art from  the museum has  been  a passion for much  of 20th- century art.  (Of course  there  has  been  an opposite passion on the  part  of many artists  to get into the museum so that their art can be noticed.)
