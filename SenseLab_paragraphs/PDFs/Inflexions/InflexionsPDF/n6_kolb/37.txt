In  this  essay,  though, I want  to  discuss a  different danger, that  without new social  norms that  encourage engagement, and  new  sites  for  that  engagement, their  kind  of architecture would remain like a museum exhibition, an occasional foreground  holiday  or  experimental  lark,   and   could   not  have   a  continuing influence  on  bodily   inhabitation.  It  needs   to  be  more   available  and   to  be approached within social  practices that  define  it as for daily  life rather than  for an exciting exception from daily life.
