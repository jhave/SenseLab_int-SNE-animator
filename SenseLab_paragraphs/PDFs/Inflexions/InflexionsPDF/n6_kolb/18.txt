Outside  the  museum  we  run   into   obstreperous  art  that   glories   in  denying reverential distance – guerrilla theater, performance art, some public  installations
– yet  these  often  bring  the  museum with  them,  putting invisible lines  around
themselves as  works  to  be  contemplated. It is so easy  for  the  work  or  for  the audience to adopt an aesthetic attitude that insulates the audience from challenge to their  beliefs, attitudes, or bodily  orientation. Trying  to overcome this distance can  force  the  artworks  to  become   more   and   more   extreme,  which   in  turn encourages still more distance on the part  of the audience.
