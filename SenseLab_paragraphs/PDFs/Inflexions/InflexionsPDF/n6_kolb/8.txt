Arakawa and  Gins’s  architecture does  not  want  to  stay  in  the  background;  it fights  to be noticed, because their  aim is to increase  and  make  more  precise  our self-conscious bodily  inhabitation of space  in daily  life. But Arakawa and  Gins may well be trapped by their modernist ambitions for total reconstruction, which can  keep  their  work  from  influencing people’s  daily  lives.  This  essay  explores that trap,  their confinement in the Museum.
