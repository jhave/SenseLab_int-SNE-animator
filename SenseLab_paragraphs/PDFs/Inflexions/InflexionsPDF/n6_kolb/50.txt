Arakawa and  Gins need  new social norms that encourage people to live daily  life in their difficult  and  ambiguous spaces.  But it would be more accurate to say that what  would benefit  their  work  would be the  collision  of multiple social  norms. The  activities  of  daily   life  would go  on,  defined  by  their   usual norms and requirements. But cross-cutting and  challenging them  would be the norms of mindfulness, bodily  care, and a new precision that enriches daily routines.
