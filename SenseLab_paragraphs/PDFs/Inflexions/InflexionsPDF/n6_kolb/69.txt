In print  everything is made  small and  static. Probably most people who have experienced Arakawa and  Ginsâ€™ Mechanism of Meaning series  have  done  so in book  form.  The panels in full size  [approximately 5 x 8 feet] confront a person face-to-face.  They  demand attention. In  a  book,  even  in  a  large-format coffee table  book,  the  panels are  reduced to the  size  of crossword puzzles. There  is a subtle  change in what  dominates what.  The reader is not challenged in the same way; she can pick up and put down.
