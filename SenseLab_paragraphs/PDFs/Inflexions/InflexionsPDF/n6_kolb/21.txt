This  is  not  to  deny   that   there   are  many   buildings  created to  be  objects  for contemplation, with  aesthetic fa√ßades  that  photograph well and  hide  thoroughly conventional spatial patterns.  Much  architecture is  designed to  be  consumed easily,  so  as  not  to  challenge familiar activities and  goals.  Such  buildings  fit nicely into the flat media that display and publicize them.
