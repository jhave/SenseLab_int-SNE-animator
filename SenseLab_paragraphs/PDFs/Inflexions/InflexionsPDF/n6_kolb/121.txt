[5] See the discussion of the problem of habituation in Kolb 2004 and  also in my review of Architectural Body (Kolb 2002). I still worry that  Arakawa and  Gins do not have  a lasting  solution to the habituation problem. Orientations get set. You learn  where the traps  and  tricks  are and  develop daily  routines around them.  In their  buildings the demand for physical activity  would not decrease but the perceptual disorientations and challenges would fade.
