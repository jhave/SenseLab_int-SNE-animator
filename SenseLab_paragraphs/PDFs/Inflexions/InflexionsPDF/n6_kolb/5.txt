Architecture has always represented the prototype of a work  of art the reception of  which   is  consummated  by  a  collectivity  in  a  state   of  distraction.  .  .  . Architecture [is] appropriated in a twofold manner: by use and  by perception, or rather, by touch  and  sight.  Such appropriation cannot  be understood in terms  of the  attentive concentration of a tourist before  a famous building . . . [Buildings
are appropriated] not so much  by attention as by habit. [1]
