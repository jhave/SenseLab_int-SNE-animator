It is true  that  reproductions of art works  do not need  to function this way  -- one could  have,  for example, a full-size  reproduction of a Rothko  painting that  might challenge one  in daily  life just  as might  the  original in Houston, but  it is more likely  one  would have  a photograph or a poster of the  painting, much  smaller and  confined. The encounter would be defined and  limited. The art work  would be  more  under control,   stimulating standardized  responses, fitting  into  one’s color scheme.  And,  large or small, the reproduction might  be serving mainly as a token  of one’s taste and status.
