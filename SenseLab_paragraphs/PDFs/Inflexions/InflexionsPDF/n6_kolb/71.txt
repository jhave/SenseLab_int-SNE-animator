Cinema began  outside the museum and  then  crept  in, yet film has never  had  the museum as its goal. In many  ways  cinema  has tried  to do what  architecture tries to do,  create  a place  that  influences people to live  differently. Of course,  most films, like most  architecture, aspire  only  to reinforce current patterns. But filmâ€™s institutionalization in movie  theaters created a special  place with  its own physicality, not of motion but  of attention, a way  of holding the body  and  being open.  Now  that  spatiality is changing as  more  and  more  films  are  viewed at home.
