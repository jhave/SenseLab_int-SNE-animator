2. Prelude  to the introduction  of ZeNeZ:  “Thunderbolts  explode  between different  intensities, but they are preceded by an invisible, imperceptible  dark precursor,  which determines  their path  in advance but in reverse, as though intagliated.  Likewise  every system contains  its  dark precursor  which ensures the communication  of peripheral  series  [...] There  is no doubt  that there  is an identity  belonging  to the precursor and a resemblance  between the series  which it causes to communicate.  This ‘there  is’  however remains  perfectly  indeterminate.”(Deleuze,
1968, 2004: 144-145)
