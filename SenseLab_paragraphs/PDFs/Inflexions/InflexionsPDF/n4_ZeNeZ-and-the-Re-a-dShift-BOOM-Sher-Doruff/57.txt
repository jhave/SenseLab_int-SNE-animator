8. “In nonlinear dynamics, pink noise […]  is particularly interesting, because it characterizes processes that lie between the regular order of black  noise and the complete disorder of white noise   […][…] White  noise   is characterized   by the  normal  distribution  of the  Gaussian  bell curve.  Pink noise  with a 1/f spectrum  is decidedly  non-Gaussian.  Its  patterns are footprints  of complex self-organizing systems.” (Mainzer, 2004, 199-200)
