“The most general formula  of the relation to oneself is the affect of self on self, or folded force. Subjectification  created by folding [...] there  are four foldings,  four folds of subjectification  […] These  four folds are  like the  final or formal  cause, the acting  or material  cause  of subjectivity or interiority as a relation to oneself.” (Deleuze, 1988, 104)
