3. A  longish   citation  that helps  situate   speeds  and slownesses   with  what  comes  to  light: “Movements,  becomings,  in other  words, pure  relations  of speeds and slowness,  pure affects, are below  and above the  threshold  of  perception.   Doubtless,   thresholds  of  perception  are relative; there  is always a threshold capable of grasping what eludes another … If movement is imperceptible  by nature, it  is so always  in relation  to a given  threshold  of perception,  which is by nature  relative   and thus plays   the  role   of a  mediation   on the  plane   that  effects  the distribution  of thresholds  and percepts  and makes forms perceivable  to perceiving  subjects […]   movement is no  longer  tied  to the mediation  of a relative  threshold  that it  eludes  ad infinitum; it  has reached regardless  of its  speed or slowness,  an absolute  but differentiated threshold  that  is one  with the  construction  of this  or that region  of the  continued  plane  [...] Movement  ceases to be the procedure of an always  relative  deterritorialization,  becoming  the process  of absolute  deterritorialization.  The difference  between the two planes  accounts for the fact that what cannot be perceived  on one cannot but be perceived  on the other. It  is in jumping  from one plane  to the other or from the relative  thresholds  to the absolute  threshold that coexists  with them,  that  imperceptible   becomes necessarily  perceived.”  (Deleuze  and Guattari, 1987: 281-282)
