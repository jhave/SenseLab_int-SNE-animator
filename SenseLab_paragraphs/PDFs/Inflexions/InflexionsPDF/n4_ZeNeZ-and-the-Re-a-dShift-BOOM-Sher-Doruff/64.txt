13. Deleuze  diagrammed  Foucault’s  bifurcation  of visibilities and articulations/statements  and pushed the distinction  between content and expression,  the receptive  and the spontaneous, Light  (what  comes  to light) and  Language.  Distinguishing  between Red as Light/Content  and Read as Language/expression  and their  resonant  waveform qualities  of pitch,  intensity  and formants  is a  peculiar  rendering  of reciprocal  presupposition  between  forms of content  and forms of expression.  “”It  is vain  that we say what we see; what we see never resides  in what we say.”[quoting  Foucault,  The Order of Things]  […]  There  are two distinct  formalizations  in reciprocal  presupposition  and constituting  a double-pincer:  the formalization  of expression  in the reading and writing lesson (with its own relative contents), and the formalization of content in the lesson of things (with their own relative expressions). We are never signifier or signified. We are stratified.” (Deleuze and Guattari, 1987, 67)
