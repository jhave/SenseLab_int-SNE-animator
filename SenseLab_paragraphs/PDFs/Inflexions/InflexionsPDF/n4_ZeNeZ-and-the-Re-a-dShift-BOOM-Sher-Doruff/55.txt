6. In  a  final interview  with Claire Parnet  (L'Abécédaire  de  Gilles Deleuze,  1988/1995) they arrive  at the letter  “Z”: “  So what happens in Zed he asks?  Musing aloud  , he sees Zen as the reverse of Nez (nose) which is also  a zigzag. (Deleuze  gestures the angle of  a nose in the air.) Zed as movement, the fly, is perhaps the elementary  movement that presided  at the creation of the world […]  So there  is the dark precursor  (Deleuze gestures Z in the air) then a lightening bolt,  and that’s  how the  world was born. There  is always  a dark precursor that no one sees, and then the lightening  bolt  that illuminates,  and there  is the  world. He says that’s  also  what thought should be, the grand Zed, but also the wisdom of Zen.” (Stivale, 2008, 20)
