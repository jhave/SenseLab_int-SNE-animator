7. Jitsu  and Kyo are energetic  states of the more and less  that are recognized  by Zen Shiatsu practitioners.   They resemble  the energetic  dynamisms  of coloured  noise,  moving  through the limit thresholds  of white  (Jitsu)  to black  (Kyo).  “The Jitsu  condition  can be likened  to the thing which preoccupies  a person,  while the  thing  that  a person  is not aware  of can be  called  the Kyo.   The  Chinese   character  for Jitsu   denotes a house which  is  filled to  capacity   […]   The Chinese  character for Kyo represents a mound which is hollow in the center […]  Both Kyo and Jitsu  are result  of the dynamics  of Ki in the  body […]  Kyo and Jitsu,  rather than being  absolute principles,  are relative  concepts which are  neither  good nor bad in themselves.  They are  very similar  to Yin  and Yang  in that  they  describe  two opposite  tendencies.  The only difference  is that Kyo and Jitsu  describe  the availability  and functional  availability  of Ki,  or vital  energy.” (Masunaga, 1987, 112-113)
