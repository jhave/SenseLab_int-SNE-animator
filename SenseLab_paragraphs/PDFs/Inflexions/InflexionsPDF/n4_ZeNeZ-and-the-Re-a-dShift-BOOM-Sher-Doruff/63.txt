- from the constrained  and measured. Via  the functions  of science:  “By  the 1920s, high-speed photography revealed  that a whip's  cracker can indeed  break the sound barrier.  The question for Goriely, however,  was: How can the  relatively  slow speed  of a whip pulled  back and forth generate such high  speeds at the tip?  […]  The tip  approaches infinite speed in some  models and maintains  a constant speed in others  […]  The crack happens when the loop reaches the end of the whip and opens.” (May, 2002)
