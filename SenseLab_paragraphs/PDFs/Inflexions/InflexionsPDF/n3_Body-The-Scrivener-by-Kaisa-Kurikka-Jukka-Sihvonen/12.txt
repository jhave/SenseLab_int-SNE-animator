The  striking  concept  here   is  impersonality;  the  self  without  self  or  subject without subjectivity – paradoxically embodied here  in the  form  of Bartleby  (in Melville’s story)  and  the  dancer (in Deep).  In a sense  – as the  title  of her  book indicates – Arsić’s  seven  and   a  half  times  Bartleby   are  different attempts at dealing with  the problematic of impersonality.  We would argue that  Deep does the   same   with   the   means   of  the   dancer’s  body-movements  and   the   video arrangements,  or  rather,  audiovisual  continuations,  extensions,  even protuberances attached to the  movements of the  muscles and  bones.    The way the  dancer moves  can  be described as entering the  aesthetic and  philosophical realm  of Japanese  Butoh,  but  performed in  combinations of accelerated speed and   varying  slownesses.    This   connection  with   Butoh   also   relates   to  the problematic of impersonality.  One of the leading figures  of the butoh tradition, Kazua  Ono,  has  stated that  the  butoh-dancer must   separate herself  from  the personal, physical and  social  self  to  such  an  extreme that  the  basis  for  butoh- dancing lies  in  ‘a dead body’.   The  butoh-dancer is constantly deconstructing corporeality through transformations, metamorphoses as becoming (Parviainen
1994, 66).   Yet,  rather than  following Arsić,  to  mystify the  force  of  touch   by speaking  about   it  as  touching ‘the  infinite,’  we  would say  that   ‘impersonal trembling’ could  be thought of as yet another mode  of a somagram.  This concept refers  at  this  point  to  the  impersonal and  therefore invisible body-movement made  visible by the means  of image and sound technologies.
