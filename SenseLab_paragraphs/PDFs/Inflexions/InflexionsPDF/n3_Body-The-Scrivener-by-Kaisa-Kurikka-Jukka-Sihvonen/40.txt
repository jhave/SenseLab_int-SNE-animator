Perhaps  even  more   than   being   seen,  this  pulse   becomes   heard in  Deep: the soundtrack is based  on a rhythmic pulse  of an electronic chord  that  sounds like a breathing or heartbeat of a machine, with  about  20 beats  a minute in a very  low D-minor even.   Almost  the only moments of synchronisation between image  and sound take  place  when the  human figure  (whether on  stage  or  on  the  screen) opens   his  mouth,  from   which   an  electronically manipulated  ‘roar’  of  some animal comes out.
