case of the depressive, the person asks herself  whether she is organizing her depression  in   any   particular  way.      In   this   case   she   is   compacting  and compressing herself  both  physically and  emotionally.  In steps  two and  three  the participant chooses  to intensify the  former pattern, to compress the  self a little more,  and  to  step  back  to  compress a little  less.    One  can  go  back  and  forth between these steps.   The experiment of compressing a little more  and  a little less plays  like an accordion. Step  four  is simply a moment of waiting and  allowing the  feelings   and   associations  to  arise.     Keleman  refers   to  this  as  a  stage   of emotional incubation.  This is the  creative space  of the  middle ground:  “It is a pause in which  you feel elements of something about  to happen. The attitude of openness is one of containment. […] You are between what  has ended and  what has not yet arrived, in a pregnant place” (Keleman 1987, 15).
