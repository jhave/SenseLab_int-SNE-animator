passing through.   As  Gilles  Deleuze has  written on  the  capturing image  of a particular life turning outside facing  its inside  at the  moment of death-to-come: “This  indefinite life does  not  itself  have  moments, close  as they  may  be one  to another, but  only between-times, between-moments” (2001, 29).  Here  Deleuze’s point  of reference is Our Mutual  Friend (1865) written by Charles Dickens.   The hero of the novel  prompts Deleuze to connect  the indefinite with  the impersonal: “The life of the individual gives  way  to an impersonal and  yet singular life that releases a pure  event  freed  from the accidents of internal and  external life” (2001,
28).
