In this context  a couple  of details are worth mentioning.  Laboratory research on ultrasound was  heavily subsidized in  the  United States  right  after  the  Second World  War  until  the  mid-1950s,  especially by the  United States  military forces. On  the  one  hand, the  research focused on  developing technologies capable of detecting underwater military vehicles  such  as submarines.  On the  other  hand, the  research concentrated on  studying living  organisms, especially the  human brain,  attempting to  diagnose tumours  growing inside   such  living  tissue,  for example.  All this research was  based  on the idea  of an echo and  the question of how to record these sonic echoes into a visible form.  The model of this technique is fairly simple:  the image  becomes  visible with  the help of sonic beams  reflecting back  from  a structure that  is inside  a bigger  entity.    In other  words, the  echoes that  are  reflected from  the  invisible inside   ‘draw’  the  image   to  be  seen  and sensed.
