The  double nature of  Deep relates   not  only  to  the  pair  of  surface/depth  (or skin/deep),  but  also  to dimensions both  in space  and  in movement itself.  The dancing body  is constantly moving in horizontal axis, from left to right  and  back again  as following a geometrical path.    The spatiality of Deep follows  two- dimensional directions as is conventional for moving images  projected on flat screens.   On the other  hand, the movements of the dancing body,  its somagram, also emphasize the  intensities of the  body-as-weight.  The dancer never  jumps, never  attempts to  lift the  body  into  air.   On  the  contrary, the  movements are directed either  to bodily  levels (lines that  are reachable by the body  and  its limbs
‘naturally’) or they  take place on the floor, they  are grounded.  The horizontality and  spatiality of the  movements focus  on  the  weight of the  body,  materialized also by the bent knees  and  floppy arms.   These are the forces that  ‘glue’ the body to the  ground.  Again  they  are signs  of an invisible and  underground magnetic field  that  draws the  body  towards itself.   This can be experienced clearly  in the form  of the  birds  referred to at several  occasions during the  performance: these creatures cannot fly, they  are chickens  bound to stay on the ground.  The body  is static,  heavy  and  impaired.  Nevertheless it includes several  kinds  of interesting movements, as it were,  the somagrammatical alphabets.
