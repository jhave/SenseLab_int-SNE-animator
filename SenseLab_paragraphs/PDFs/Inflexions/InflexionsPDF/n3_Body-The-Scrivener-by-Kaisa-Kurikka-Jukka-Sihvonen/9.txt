An  impersonal and  yet  singular life is also  something the  lawyer of Melville’s story  had  to deal  with  many  times  before  the ‘final’ encounter between Bartleby and  himself.   Nevertheless, as Branka  Arsić argues: “It is not  clear that  Bartleby dies”  (2007, 107).  This ambiguity between life and  death comes  to be called  the “impersonal,” which  is one of the perspectives referring to the entire  problematic of Bartleby  as discussed by Arsić.   Furthermore, in the  quote  above,  the  contact between Bartleby  and  the  attorney is a document of the  existence  of life as an affective  energy.  According to Arsić: “That  is why  the  narrative ends  with  this trembling and   as  this  trembling, with  a  life  that  comes  from  ‘death’  and   so negates it; the narrative ends  with  a touch  that touches the infinite” (2007, 107). Let this  be a preface  to our  discussion about  two  things:  a concept (somagram) and   a  solo  performance piece  called  Deep by  a  Finnish   contemporary dance group, 	Alpo 	Aaltokoski	Company 	(choreography 	and 	performance 	by Aaltokoski himself).   What  follows  proceeds from  a will to create  a new  concept in connection to this enigmatic dance  performance and  a wish  to find  a platform for the corporeal and  conceptual vibrations in-between various immanent planes of thought and  bodily  encounters.  During the last five-minutes of Deep, a video by  Milla  Moilanen,  a  Finnish   animator  and   new   media  artist,   is  projected. Whether intentionally or not, the combination of the live dancer and  the screened audiovisuals vividly recreates the scenery  from  the story  of Bartleby.   The video shows  fragments of life projected on the white  wall – powerfully present both  as colour  and  form  in Melville’s story-world itself.   The immobile dancer becomes
