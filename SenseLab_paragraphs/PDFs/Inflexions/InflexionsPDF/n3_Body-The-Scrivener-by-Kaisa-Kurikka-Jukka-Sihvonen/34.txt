Deep is a physiological study of the  origin  of movements. It shows  how  various living  organisms – not  just human bodies,  but  also trees,  birds  etc. – follow  the same  principles of moving.  The included media artwork of the  same  name  by Milla Moilanen [originally made  in 1994] especially intensifies this idea.   This computer-animated video  constitutes the  central  element in the  final  part  of the choreography,  and   the  male  dancer  on  the  video   screen   is  juxtaposed  with Aaltokoski performing live on stage.  In the first part  of the piece, the live-dancer, Aaltokoski, moves  across  the stage in a butoh-like manner.  Attention focuses  on his upper body,  his arms  and  his amazingly loose shoulder blades,  moving and re-moving  the  motions of  some  kind   of  a  lizard-bird into  human exposure.
