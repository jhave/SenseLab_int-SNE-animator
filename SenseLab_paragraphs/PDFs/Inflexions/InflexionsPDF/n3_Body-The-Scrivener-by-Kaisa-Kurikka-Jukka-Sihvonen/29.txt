root  of  both  verbs  is  graphein (γραφειν).   According  to  Stimpson, images   of Stein’s body,  such  as her  written poems, and  others  of her,  such  as the  famous portrait painted by Picasso,  attempt “to fix monstrous qualities.”  Nevertheless, these  monstrous somagrams, “like all monstrosities”, adds Stimpson, become desired as fixed and  stabilized: “We often toil in vain”  (1985, 67).  To consider the written image  of the body  monstrous both because it is a fixed image and  a mode of writing indicates a desire  to  load  a lot  of meaning into  the  somagram as  a representation.   However, as the earlier  examples from biotechnology and psychotherapy have  already indicated, rather than  representations, somagrams are sensations – and in adding a Steinian  emphasis, even ghostly ones.
From  all of these  backgrounds something can  be and  has  been  taken  with  into our understanding of the concept somagram: the echo from  the medical function, the  reflection from  the  therapeutic function, and  the  ghost from  the  literary and critical  function.  The argument is that  the  live performance in Deep works  as a kind  of ultrasonic image  and  the video  screen  presents an invisible world as the imaginary tissue  generating the  bodily  echoes.   This world of imaginary tissue, however, can have only a ghostly embodiment because there is no direct  link to
it.  It hangs  in the air as it were  the roots  of a tree in a mangrove forest  growing upside down.
