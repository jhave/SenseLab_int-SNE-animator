The notion of the diagram comes from Deleuze and  Guattari. They conceptualize it as describing a piloting role  in steering the  multiplicity of potential relations between elements. The diagram “does  not function to represent, even something real, but rather constructs a real that  is yet to come, a new  type  of reality” (1988,
142).  According to Anna  Munster: “Located at the other  pole is the assemblage, in  which   the   process  of  machinism  is  concretized;   its  elements  are   given substance;   and   its   functions  are   expressed  within  a  particular  form.      As assemblage, as the term  suggests, is a composition of elements – matter, technologies, socialities  – whose  diagrammatic dimensions have  been  organized into particular relations” (2006, 35).
