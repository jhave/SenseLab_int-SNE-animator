The three  alphabets of Deep reconstruct a ‘proposition’ that  can be expressed in the  following way:  dance  (D) emerges (E) from/with/as an emergence (E) of a pulse  (P).  The prepositions (from,  with,  as) are all there  as guides for potential emphasis on particular somagrammatical folds:  ‘from’ as a reference to an echo,
‘with’  as  a  reference to  reflection, and  ‘as’  as  a  reference to  the  ghost.    The concept  that   ties  the  somagram to  the  diagram is  emergence.   According  to Deleuze:  “The  essential point  about  the  diagram is that  it is made  in order for something to emerge from  it, and  if nothing emerges from  it, it fails” (2003, 159). The movements of the live performance in Deep emerge from the video  screen  as the  ‘tingling  shiver’  from  Bartleby,  and  the  dancer on  stage  is  like  his  hand
