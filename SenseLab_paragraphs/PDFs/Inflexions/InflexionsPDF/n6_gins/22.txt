Those  who  have  any  inclination at  all  toward (the  achieving of  a)  reversible destiny surely  register that  our species  is routinely subjected to unending horror (out  of which  Drear  invariably forms).  Do not add  any  more  fuel to this blazing outrage, thinking-feeling species.  Let none  of us tear either  ourselves or others  to shreds and,  yes, we are often half-inadvertently thinking-feeling shredders of the animate.
