The ambiguous zones  that  make  fools of us all can be de-ambiguated (to some degree) by means  of tactically  posed surrounds. Did you just say off there  where you  are,  but,  Oh  Madeline, we  are  constituted of ambiguous zones?  Changing how   we  are  constituted  is  our   task,  I  insist.   Here   is  a  presentation  of  this morning’s (this year’s) ambiguous zone: selves  and  dynamisms many,  occurring
as many  parts  – or perhaps not.
