ephemeral  occurrences do  not  have   a  place   in  his  understanding  of  visual perception because they  are  not  stable  and  distinct entities.  This is because, for him,  the jittery  flickers  and  irregular rhythms viewers experience when looking at Mondrian’s paintings are not solidly  grounded in something like the paint  on a canvas  or something rational like  the  structure of grids.    Thompson believes that:  “In  perception, one  is  aware of  things as  stable  and  distinct entities   in relation to an indeterminate background” (1995: 247). This would mean  that  in order for  viewers to  encounter the  images  generated in  the  shared experience with   Mondrian’s   paintings,  they   would  have   to   background  the   dynamic movement that  is actually experienced as the flickers  and  the irregular rhythms felt in the seeing.  Viewers  would have  to encounter the compositional elements in  these  works,   and  the  paintings themselves, as  a  set  of  stable  entities   that constitute the  images  they  see.   They  would have  to concentrate solely  on  the perceptual landing sites, paying absolutely no attention to either  the imaging and dimensional landing sites that  occur in the seeing,  which  enable  the activation of the dynamism that is felt in the midst of the shared experience.
