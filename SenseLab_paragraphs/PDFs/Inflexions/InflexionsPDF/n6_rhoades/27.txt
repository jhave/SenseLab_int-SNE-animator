duality or  multiplicity – as a complex” (1986/1993:  86, original emphasis). This “complex” involves the  relations among the  plastic,  or compositional, elements of  the  painting –  such   as  lines,  colours,   and   the  planes  they   compose.  For Mondrian: “If purely plastic  expression is created by ‘the relationships’ of line, planes surface,  and  colour  in their  purely plastic  values,  then  these  means  exist only through their  relationships. Therefore, relationships are just as important as the plastic  means” (1986/1993:  246). The relations that  occur between the compositional elements are just as vital to the emergence of images  for Mondrian as the compositional elements themselves.
