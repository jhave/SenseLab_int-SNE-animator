The  vitality of  living  organisms as  well  as  their  physical characteristics is manifested not only through their  appearance but through their  movement. Vitality  is more  difficult  to discern in inorganic things. Nevertheless we feel the vitality of reality  in everything that  exists. In plastic  art this feeling  of vitality is created through  the  dynamic rhythm  of  forms   and   colours.   (Mondrian
1986/1993:  387)
