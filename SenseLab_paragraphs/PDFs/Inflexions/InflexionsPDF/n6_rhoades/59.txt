In that  brief pause between experiencing a composition of visual  elements and  a dynamic rhythm that  incites  the  viewers’  gaze  to  move  about  the  canvas,  the critical  holder, to  paraphrase Gins  and  Arakawa, enables viewers to  hold  the images  that  hold  them.  [12] “Everything stops  dead for  a moment, everything freezes  in place – and  then  the whole  process  will begin  all over again” (Deleuze and  Guattari 1983: 7). The perpendicular lines in Composition No. 12 with Blue or the coloured planes in Broadway Boogie Woogie emerge as the critical  holder that hesitantly  facilitates the  “construction” or  incipiency  of  images,   while simultaneously holding the shared experience between the painting and  viewers in place. The critical holder enables viewers to feel the emergence of a dynamism that can only be felt in the seeing during the shared experience.
