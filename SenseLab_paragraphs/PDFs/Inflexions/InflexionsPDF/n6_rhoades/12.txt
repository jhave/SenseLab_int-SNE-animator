Although grids  form the underlying invariant structure for matrices, matrices are not grids.  The grids  that  constitute matrices are backgrounded from the viewers’ attention. By taking  the  viewers’  focus  away  from  the  grids  as  such,  matrices bring   the  elements that  change within grids   to  the  forefront of  the  viewers’ perceptual awareness. A good  example of this can be seen in John F. Simon  Jr.’s internet artwork Every Icon (1997). [4] As Eckmann explains, the grid in this work cannot  generate the images  viewers see as such;  rather, it “remains one and  the same  while  the matrix,  independent from  a fixed form,  is shown as the tool that creates  these  new  images” (2006: 17). When  looking  at Every Icon, the  viewers’ attention is not  on the  grid  that  structures the  unfathomable number of images that  are generated in this  work.  Instead, their  attention is focused on the frantic oscillation of black and  white  squares that  generated movement across  the grid. Viewers  do not perceive an invariant grid  that  happens to contain elements that change;  rather, they  see black and  white  moving images  that  primarily flicker in the upper left corner  of the work.
