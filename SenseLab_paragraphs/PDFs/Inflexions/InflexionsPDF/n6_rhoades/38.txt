Composition No.  12 with  Blue shows   that  the  line  that  demarcates grids   from matrices is not  solid  because the  dynamic movement generated from  the  jittery rhythm felt  in  the  seeing  blurs   this  boundary. In  Mondrianâ€™s last  completed painting, Broadway Boogie Woogie (1942-43), the  criteria  that  separate grids  from matrices become   even  more  tenuous. This  is  because Broadway Boogie Woogie generates a dynamism felt in the  seeing  without any  black  perpendicular lines. There  is no grid  that  is immediately visible,  unlike Composition No. 12 with Blue. Rather  than  composing this  painting with  black  perpendicular lines,  Mondrian fills Broadway Boogie Woogie with  an  array  of rectangular and  square planes of varying sizes.  The  larger   planes are  primarily white   and  are  surrounded by smaller, mostly  square, planes that  are  composed of four  different colours:  red, yellow,  blue, and  grey. What  is striking about  this square painting (127 x 127 cm) is that  as  viewers look  at  it, they  begin  to  notice  that  the  smaller planes that border the  larger   white   planes  actually form  a  series  of  perpendicular lines.
