Matrices  are  bodies  generated on  the  plane  of reference. They  transform grids from static configurations into bodies  that are capable  of change. They enable difference to occur across  the invariant structure of grids.  Because matrices open grids  to change, for Eckmann and  Koepnick, they  “emancipate the grid  from  its confinement to two  dimensions;  they  displace the  grid’s  tendency towards the static  and  unchangeable” (2006: 9). Matrices  enable  grids  to extend beyond their own  invariance through the  displacement of “pixilated visual  bits”  that  change within the grid itself.
