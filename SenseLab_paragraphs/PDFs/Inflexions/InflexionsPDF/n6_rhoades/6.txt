Grids  can appear to present space  and  time  statically. For some  people the sight of grids  can immediately conjure  up notions of fixity, timelessness, and  imposed order. According to Lutz Koepnick, grids  are “not a product of the unpredictable temporality of the viewers’ physical movement and  sensory perception but a prearranged logic of compilation and construction, a mechanism seemingly engineering uniformity, universality and  unwavering stability” (2006: 53-54). Images  such  as algebraic graphs, geographic maps  and  architectural blueprints come  to  mind. Through their  use  of  Cartesian x/y  coordinates, these  images produce gridded spaces  that  establish a  methodical, inanimate, and  invariant order upon all that  is contained within them.  [1] Koepnick and  Sabine  Eckmann suggest that  the  grids  found in  the  modernist paintings of the  early  twentieth century  particularly  display  this   inclination towards immutability and predictability. For them,  “the  grid  enabled art’s  capacity to distance itself  from language,  figuration,  and   representation  and   provided  visual    experiences favouring simultaneity over  the  sequential, the  spatial over  the  temporal, the abstract  over   the   representational,  and   the   universal  over   the   particular” (Eckmann and  Koepnick 2006: 8). One clear example they give is the paintings of Piet Mondrian. [2]
