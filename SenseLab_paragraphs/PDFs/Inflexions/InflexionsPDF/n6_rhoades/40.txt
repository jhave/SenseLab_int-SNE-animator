In Broadway Boogie Woogie, the  perpendicular lines  and  the  grid  can actually be difficult   for  viewers to  see  as  a  cohesive whole   because these  compositional elements are  not  a uniform colour.  This  is because the  lines  and  the  grid  are generated in the  seeing.  Discussing Broadway Boogie Woogie, Mondrian explains that  the perpendicular lines composed of the small planes are not the only things that  are produced through the activity  of seeing,  but  that  the planes themselves are as well. He states  that,  “the  lines  are absorbed by the colour  planes;  but  the limitation of  the  planes  shows   themselves  as  lines  and   conserve  their   great value” (Mondrian 1986/1993:  356). The  perpendicular lines  viewers see, which form  the  grid,  are  composed of the  small  coloured planes. The coloured planes themselves  are  composed  of  contour lines  that   surround their   edges.   These contour lines, which  delineate the planes’ shape,  emerge in the relations between the  coloured planes. The  contour lines  and  coloured planes mutually compose each  other   and   together generate the  painting’s  relational  complex. It  is  the mutual  composition of  and   relations  between  the   coloured  planes  and   the contour lines that enable  the emergence of the perpendicular lines and the grid.
