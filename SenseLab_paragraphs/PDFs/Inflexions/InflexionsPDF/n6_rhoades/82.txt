We  cannot   restrict   mentality  just  to  human  beings;   nor   can  we restrict  it to mammals, or to organisms that have nervous systems, or even  to the entire  animal kingdom. Rather,  we must  say that  plants, fungi,   and   unicellular  organisms  think;   and   what   is  more,   that nonliving entities,   like  stars  and   lumps of  granite, think   as  well.
