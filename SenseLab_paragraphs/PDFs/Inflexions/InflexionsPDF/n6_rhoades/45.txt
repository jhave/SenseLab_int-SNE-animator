experienced is always composed of more  landing sites. “Anything perceived can count  as both a landing site in and of itself and as a larger  landing site” (Gins and Arakawa  2002:  9).  Because   there   are  landing sites  within landing sites  that constitute  even   bigger   landing  sites,   Gins   and   Arakawa  further  refine   the conception  of  landing  sites   and   specify   that   there   are  three   distinct  types: perceptual landing sites,  imaging landing sites  and  dimensional landing sites. The composition of anything that  emerges into  experience involves all three  of these   types   of  landing  sites   simultaneously.  This   is  because,  as  Gins   and Arakawa state,  “[l]anding sites  dissolve into  each  other,  or abut,  or overlap, or nest within each other” (2002: 8). It is through the overlapping of the three  types of landing sites  that  experience emerges, changes, and  is made  perceptible. As the   three   types   of   landing  sites   constantly  shift   their   configurations,  the experience that they compose and recompose is always in the making.
