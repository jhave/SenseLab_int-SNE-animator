attract  and   hold   the  viewers’  gaze.   The  initial   configuration  that   begins   to become  visible in Mondrian’s paintings is the critical holder, which  takes form as the composing black lines in Composition No. 12 with Blue or the coloured planes in  Broadway Boogie Woogie. In  that  hesitant moment when the  critical  holder emerges, several  actions  occur  almost  simultaneously, enabling the incipiency of images.  To begin  with,  the viewers’ attention is held. Then the shared experience is activated between Mondrian’s paintings and  the viewers. Finally,  the relational complex continues to come together after  viewers see the initial  configuration of the black  lines,  in the case of Composition No. 12 with Blue or the composition of coloured planes in Broadway Boogie Woogie. From these three  nearly  simultaneous occurring actions  a rhythm becomes  active  in  the  seeing.  Images  then  emerge from  the  jittery  and  irregular rhythms of these  paintings, holding the  viewers’ attention even longer.
