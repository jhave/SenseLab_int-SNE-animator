Many   viewers will  experience  a  motion  that   is  not  actually painted  on  the canvas,  but  one  that  is felt  through the  activity  of seeing.  Susanne K.

This  movement in Mondrian’s work  generates a dynamism that  is beyond vision  itself.  It exceeds both  the  compositional elements that  comprise the  painting and  the  viewers’ ability   to  see.  “To  exceed   vision   is  to  displace  the  disciplinary  contours  of thought to engage with  the  ephemeral” (Manning 2003: 11). Viewers  can  sense that  there  is something at  work  in  Mondrian’s painting, yet  at  the  same  time there   is  nothing  tangible  to  verify   that   anything  has   actually  occurred.
