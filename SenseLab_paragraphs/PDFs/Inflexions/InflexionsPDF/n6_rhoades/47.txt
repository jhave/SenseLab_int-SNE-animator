Imaging landing sites  are  the  second type  of landing sites.  These  landing sites extend beyond the experiential limits of the perceptual landing sites. As Gins and Arakawa explain:  “Taking   off  from  perceptual landing sites  (actual  points of focus),  imaging landing sites  (generalizing factors)  extend and  diffuse  surfaces and  volumes. Imaging landing sites enlarge the areas  over  which  qualities hold sway” (2002: 12). Imaging landing sites are the incipient actions  that  generate the about  to become  perceptible of experiences. [10] They  constitute the  dynamism that  is felt gathering throughout any  composition that  is experienced. They  are the  excesses  in  the  seeing  that  are  felt  when viewers look  at  Broadway Boogie Woogie. The  dynamic movement that  viewers feel as the  irregular rhythm that compose the  perpendicular lines  and  the  grid  visible  are the  imagining landing sites, which  flow throughout Mondrian’s painting.
