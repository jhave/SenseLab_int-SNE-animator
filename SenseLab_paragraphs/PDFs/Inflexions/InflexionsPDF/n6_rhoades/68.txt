When  the  centrifugal and   centripetal forces  encounter each  other   within the shared experience between Mondrian’s paintings and  viewers, they  eventually reach  a state  of equilibrium. This equilibrium for Mondrian “is not a static  state without action,  as generally thought but, on the contrary, [it is] a continuous and mutually   annihilating   opposition   of    equivalent   but    unequal   elements” (Mondrian  1986/1993:   252).  Just  because  a  state   of  equilibrium  is  reached between the centrifugal and  centripetal forces within the shared viewer-artwork experience, it does  not  mean  that  these  forces  stop  being  active.  The centrifugal force continues to generate the more-than of experience, while  at the same  time the  centripetal force  persists in  producing the  less-than of perception. As  one force  enables more  to  be  actually experienced, the  other   constantly lures  the viewers’  attention towards particular occurrences felt in the  seeing.  Because  of the  continued activity  these  opposing compositional forces  produce, the equilibrium they  co-generate constantly shifts  and  reconfigures itself,  which  in turn  creates  the  dynamism that  is felt in the  seeing.  Together these  vertiginous compositional  forces   felt   in   the   shared  experience between viewers and Mondrian’s paintings generate a dynamism that,  according to Koepnick “at once point  our  attention inward and  outward, suspend our  perception and  stir  our appetite for more”  (2006: 55).
