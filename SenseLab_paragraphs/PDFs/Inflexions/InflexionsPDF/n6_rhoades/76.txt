In contrast to human space, in which  the verticality of the body  and the direction of the horizon are two dominant directions, computer space does not privilege any particular axis. In this way it is similar to the space of El Lissitsky’s Prouns and  Kazimer Melevich’s suprematists compositions – an abstract cosmos,  unencumbered by the earth’s  gravity or the weight of a human body  […] William Gibson’s term “matrix,” which  he used  in his novels  to refer to cyberspace, captures this isotropic quality.
