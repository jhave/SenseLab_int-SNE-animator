from  the ever-changing configurations of these  three  types  of landing sites. The perpendicular lines and the grid are made  visible not only from the configuration of  perceptual landing sites  that   are  immediately seen  as  the  composition of planes, but  also from  the imaging landing sites that  generate the dynamism felt in the seeing  and  the dimensional landing sites that  constitute the relations that occur  between all landing sites.  As these  landing sites  compose and  recompose what  viewers experience, they  also coordinate the emergence of the relational complex and  the  shared experience between Mondrian’s painting and  viewers. The  relations among  landing  sites  bring   forth   the  notion  that   the  viewers’ experience is in constant negotiation between the  overlapping of landing sites, forever  composing, in which  there  is no  distinct division between the  viewers’ body,  Mondrian’s painting, or  the  experiences that  both  share.  It  is  from  the constantly changing configurations of landing sites that  the incipiency of images is made  possible.
