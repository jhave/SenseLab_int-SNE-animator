The dynamism felt in the encounter between viewers and  Mondrian’s paintings enables both  to surpass the  rational and  stable  order that  grids  tend  to impose. Neither viewers nor  Mondrian’s paintings can  generate the  dynamism that  is experienced on their  own.  It is the felt intensity of dynamic movement generated through the activity  of seeing  that draws viewers into a shared experience, rather than  the  depictions of grids  or  the  sense  of stability the  grid  may  offer.  This means    the   dynamism  that   is   experienced  exceeds   both   what   Mondrian’s paintings offer to be seen,  as the  emergent relational complex, and  the  viewers’ actual   vision.  What  is  experienced is  co-generated through  the  relations that occur  between the  viewers and  Mondrian’s paintings through  the  activity   of seeing.  The jittery  flickers  of Composition No. 12 with Blue and  irregular rhythms of Broadway Boogie Woogie felt in the seeing  are compositional forces that  compose the  images  that  come  to  be  seen.  These  compositional forces  are  co-generated though the relations that  occur  within the shared experience because, according to Gilles Deleuze, “any  force is already a relation” (1988b: 70). These felt compositional  forces   are   the   relations  viewers  encounter  with   Mondrian’s paintings. They are what  thrust the incipiency of images  into action.
