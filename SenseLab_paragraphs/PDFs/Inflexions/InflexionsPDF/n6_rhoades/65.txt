When  looking  at Composition No. 12 with Blue or Broadway Boogie Woogie, viewers simultaneously  experience two  conflicting compositional  forces  that  constitute the dynamism felt in the seeing.  This is because, according to Mondrian, “the opposition of two forces creates  dynamic movement” (1986/1993:  384). One force centrifugally spirals  outward,  while   a  second  force   moves   in  the   opposite direction, centripetally spiraling inward. The  centrifugal force both  exceeds  the confines  of the  surface  of Mondrian’s paintings, spilling out  beyond the  works’ relational complex and  into  the  world. It also surpasses the  perceptual limits  of the viewers’ vision,  lavishing viewers with  more than they  can actually perceive. This centrifugal force is the conduit that  enables viewers to feel the emergent excesses in the seeing.
