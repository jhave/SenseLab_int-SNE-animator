[9] When  Mondrian moved to New  York in 1940, he began  to experiment with the  compositional elements in  his  paintings. This  can  be  seen  in  his  New  York series of paintings, produced between 1941 and  1942, in which  the perpendicular lines  were  no  longer  coloured black.  Instead, he  used  a variety of red,  yellow, and  blue  lines.  This use  of coloured lines  foreshadows the fragmented coloured lines  seen  in Broadway Boogie Woogie and  the  painting left on his easel  upon his death, the uncompleted Victory Boogie Woogie (1942-1944).
