The key is that  these  provisionally tentative, shared experiences need  to be held long   enough  to  enable   the  coming   together  of  relations  and   allow   for  the incipiency of images  to occur.  In order for this  holding to happen a hesitation must   occur.   Neither  Mondrian’s  paintings  nor   the   viewers  are   capable   of provoking this hesitation. Rather,  according to Gins and  Arakawa, critical holders enable  this  hesitation. Critical  holders emerge to  help  the  viewers detect  and piece  together incipient images  while  they  are “activated and  held  and  holding and  activating” (Gins and  Arakawa 2002: 82). Recall that  when viewers first encounter Composition No.  12 with  Blue, the  web  of  perpendicular black  lines holds   their  attention for  a  brief  moment just  before  the  whitish-grey  flickers begin   to  emerge  from  the  intersections.  The  moment  viewers encounter  the painting, the  black  perpendicular  lines  initiate a  composing  of  an  about-to- become  image.  This causes  a hesitation to occur  in the seeing.  It is important to understand that  the  composing black  lines  are  not  yet  an  image  as such.   This composing or incipient action  should be viewed as the initial  coming  together of the relational complex. When  viewers look at Composition No. 12 with Blue, as the black  lines  begin   composing,  a  hesitation  is  generated in  the  seeing.   When looking  at Broadway Boogie Woogie, the critical  holder is the array  of colours  that dazzle the  viewer into  hesitation. As the  viewers begin  looking  at  the  colours found in the  painting, compositions of coloured planes begin  to emerge, which then  generate the  irregular rhythm that  takes  the  viewers on  a journey around the various white  planes throughout the canvas.
