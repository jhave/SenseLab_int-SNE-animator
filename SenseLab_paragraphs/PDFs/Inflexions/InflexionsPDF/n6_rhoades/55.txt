incipiency of  images.   A  blink  of  the  eye,  a  stomach gurgling with  hunger, a gentle   breeze   flowing through  the  gallery   space,   a  cough   made   by  another viewer,  or  even   an   appearance  of  crack   in  the   paint   that   is  just   beyond perceptibility can all tentatively impact the shared experience.
