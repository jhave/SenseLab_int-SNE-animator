The idea that  there  is such a thing  as fixed form is actually as much an assumption about  perception as it is an assumption about  art. It assumes that vision is not dynamic â€“ that it is a passive, transparent registering of something that  is  just  there,  simply and  inertly. If vision   is  stable,   then   to  make   art   dynamic  you   have   to  add movement. (Massumi 2011: 40-41)
