All species  belonging to bioscleave exist only tentatively (which remains  true   whatever turns  out  to  be  the  truth about   natural selection,   whether it  happens  randomly  or  with   directionality), with  some  species,  all things being  unequal, existing  on a far more tentative   basis    than     others.     Additionally,    bioscleave   stays breathable and  in the picture only so long as elements take hold  of each  other   in  particular  ways,   only  so  long  as  there   can  be  a cleaving of a this  to a that  and  a cleaving of a this  off of a that.  So that  there   might   be  new  and   different link-ups, fresh  points of departure, ever  renewed tentative constructing towards a holding in place,  a firm  and  definite taking  hold,  which  gives  one sense  of the term  to cleave, must  also readily entail  cutting apart, cut-off, relinquishment, the  other  sense  of  the  term.
