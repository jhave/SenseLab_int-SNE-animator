Before  viewers experience this  dynamism, they  will  tend  to  notice  two  things when initially  looking  at Composition No. 12 with Blue: it presents a grid  and  it appears to be static. The painting’s black perpendicular lines seem to place a geometric order onto  the white  background, removing the potential for any movement  to  occur.   The  web   of  intersecting  black  lines  grabs   the  viewers’ attention and  stops  them  in their  tracks.  Yet, in that  brief moment as Mondrian’s web  holds  the  viewers’  attention, movement begins  to emerge. It is not  a free- flowing continuous movement but  rather one that  feels jittery,  provoking the viewers’ gaze to jump  all over the canvas.  This is because flashes  of whitish-grey begin to appear at the intersections of the black lines. The more  the viewers’ gaze jump  from  one  intersection to another, the  more  the  flickering appears. This in turn  incites  the viewers’ vision  to continue jumping. If viewers try to hold  their gaze  on one intersection, the fluttering of whitish-grey appears to diminish momentarily. However, within a couple  of seconds the flickering resumes in the other  surrounding intersections, which  eventually provokes the viewers’ gaze  to move  again.  What  viewers discover is that there  is a restless  rhythm generated in Mondrian’s   painting,   which    can    be   felt    emerging   from    the    flickering intersections. “Thus  rhythm runs  through a painting just  as  it runs  through a piece of music” (Deleuze 2003: 37).
