Composition  No.  12  with  Blue  cannot   be  classified   as  a  matrix   either.   This  is because, first, the movement that  takes place in the painting does  not result  from the  addition of motion to  the  compositional  elements; second, the  black  lines make  the  grid  visible;  and  third, it is not  a digital artwork. The moving images viewers  see   in   Mondrian’s  painting  are   not   caused  by   changes  that   are exclusively generated from  the  work  itself.  There  is no underlying binary code that  was  programmed to move  or change the compositional elements within the visible  grid,  unlike Simon’s Every Icon. Rather,  when viewers look at Composition No. 12 with Blue, the moving images  they  see are co-generated through dynamic relationship between the  relational complex of compositional elements and  the shared  experience  that   the   viewers  and   the   painting  mutually  encounter together. It is the excesses in the seeing  that  generate the dynamism that  is felt as the incipiency of images  of Mondrian’s work.
