The  first  of these  landing sites  that  compose experience are  called  perceptual landing sites.  They  can  be  understood as  the  “building blocks”  of all  landing sites.  This  is  because these  sites,  as  Gins  and   Arakawa state,  “serve   up  the initiating sites  of all sites”  (2002: 11). Perceptual landing sites  consist  of what  is actually perceived as it is being perceived. “All points or areas  of focus, that is, all designated areas  of specified activity,  count  as perceptual landing sites  (visual, aural,  tactile,  olfactory, proprioceptive,  kinesthetic, somaesthetic [pain])” (Gins and  Arakawa 2002: 10). Perceptual landing sites are the compositional elements that  are actually seen in Mondrian’s paintings, such  as the colours  and  shapes of the  planes in  Broadway Boogie Woogie. They  are  also  the  assemblages of these compositional elements, like the grouping of colored planes that  generate a particular horizontal line or a set of these  perpendicular lines, which  then  forms the grid  that  viewers eventually come to see. Perceptual landing sites, according to Manning, “are  singular and  multiple at once”  (2009: 211). Each individual perceptual landing site is a singular site onto  itself, like the coloured planes, but they  also  make  up  other  perceptual landing sites  that  are  experienced through their  multiplicity, such  as the perpendicular lines and  grid  that  are composed of many  coloured planes.
