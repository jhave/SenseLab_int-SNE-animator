Mondrian takes  a radically empirical approach to his painting practice, in which “the relations that connect  experiences must  themselves be experienced relations, and  any kind  of relation experienced must  be accounted as ‘real’ as anything else in the  system” (James  2003: 22-23). Because  the  “complex” Mondrian composes for his painting cannot  be experienced without the  relations that  gather among the compositional elements, these relations must  be considered as much  a part  of the experience viewers encounter with  the work  as the lines, colours,  and  planes seen  on  the  canvas.   Since  relations are  key  to  the  generation of  Mondrian’s “complex,” it can thus  be called a relational complex. [8] It is important to note that these  relations occurring among the compositional elements are not  just vital  to the  shared  experience viewers and  Mondrian’s work  generate. The  relational complex that  emerges from  the  compositional elements and  their  relations is in fact crucial to the experience viewers have with any artwork.
