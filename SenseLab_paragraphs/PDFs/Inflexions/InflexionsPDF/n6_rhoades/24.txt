When  viewers and  Composition No.  12 with  Blue enter  into  relations, both  the viewers and  the  painting actively  participate in generating the  images  that  are seen  through the  experience that  they  mutually share.  Images  are  only  visible when viewers experience the  painting and,  as  odd  as  it may  seem,  when the painting experiences viewers. This means  that the ability  to have an experience is not  something that  is exclusively human. Viewers  are  not  the  only  entities  that have experiences. Mondrian’s painting experiences something too, even if it is on some  rudimentary level.  Even  a  rock  experiences something. “A  falling  rock
‘feels,’ or ‘perceives,’ the gravitational field of the earth.  The rock isn’t conscious, of course;  but it is affected  by the earth,  and  this being  affected  is its experience” (Shaviro  2009: 12-13). [7] A falling  rock experiences the gravitational field of the earth   because  the  earth   has  an  impact  on  it  by  way   of  physical  attraction. Conversely, as a rock falls, the earth  also experiences the gravitational field. This is because the  gravitational field  emerges from  the  relations that  occur  between the falling rock and the earth.  The gravitational field is the shared experience that arises  from  these  relations, similar  to  the  images  that  emerge from  the  shared experience between viewers and  Mondrian’s painting. So, like a falling  rock, Composition  No.  12  with   Blue  “experiences”:  it  is  constantly  being   affected somehow, whether it is the nails holding it to the wall, the contact  it has with  the wall, the moisture floating  in the room,  or the attention the viewers visually give it.
