artists  to use digital imaging technologies and  their  underlying grids  of mathematical codes  without being  confined to an  abstract and  rigid  structure” (2006: 17). When  compared to the gridded images  of modernist painting, like Mondrian’s, the  ability  for  matrices to  produce images  that  are  different from their  underlying gridded structure can easily be understood. This is because movement generated within matrices results from  the displacement of the compositional  elements  across   the   underlying  and    imperceptible  gridded structure. When  viewers look at Mondrian’s Composition No. 12 with Blue, the compositional elements – the perpendicular lines, the white  background, and  the blue  square –  appear to  not  physically move   or  change.  For  Eckmann and Koepnick, this work  can only be seen as a static gridded image.  In the absence  of any  visible   displacement, the  grid   is  thrust to  the  forefront of  the  viewers’ attention  and   is  statically  seen   as  both   the  image   as  such   and   that   which generates this image.
