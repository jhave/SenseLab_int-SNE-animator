and  Arakawa believe  is  “between the  world as  it  happens… and  the  world, reduced and  distorted, made  to appear as other  than  what  it happens as” (2002:
51). If viewers truly  believe  that  the  images  they  see  are  exclusively the  grids painted  on  the  canvas,   then   they   will  not  visually  encounter  images   as  “a tentative  constructing  towards   a   holding  into   place.”    Viewers    who    see Mondrian’s paintings as merely static  grids  potentially miss  the  dynamism that the activity  of seeing  has  to offer. “Instead of visualizing a complete triumph of modern rationality over any remaining trace of uncertainty, Mondrian’s grids simultaneously invite  centrifugal and  centripetal readings” (Koepnick 2006: 54-
55). Works  such  as  Composition No.  12 with  Blue and  Broadway Boogie Woogie enable  a seeing in which  dynamic movement is felt in the seeing experience. Disregarding the jittery  flickers  and  the irregular rhythms felt in the seeing  goes against one of Mondrian’s most important beliefs, “that  reality  is in constant movement”  (1986/1993:   351,  original emphasis). Mondrian  held   movement in such   high   regard  because,  as   he   states,   “it   evokes   the   sensation  of  life” (1986/1993:  351).
