Eckmann and  Koepnick contend that  modernist works  consisting of grids,  like Mondrian’s Composition No. 12 with Blue, are  not  only  static,  but  also  constitute the image  viewers see. For them  the painted grid  and  the seen  image  appear to be  one  and  the  same,  approaching viewers “as  immediately recognizable and hence   devoid  of   unwanted   surprises”  (Eckmann  and   Koepnick  2006:  8). Following the assertion that  modernist grids  are static,  if the images  viewers see when looking  at Mondrian’s painting consists  only  of the grid  composed on the canvas,  then  the  seen  images  are  as immutable as the  grids  that  generate it. As viewers look  at Composition No. 12 with  Blue with  its black  perpendicular lines dividing the  white  background into  quadrilaterals of varying sizes  and  shapes, the generated image  is the static grid.
