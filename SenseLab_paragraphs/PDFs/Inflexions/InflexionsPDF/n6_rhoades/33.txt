In this light, grids  are immutable because both the seen artwork and  the viewersâ€™ ability   to  see  are  believed to  be  stable,  whereas matrices are  full  of  motion because movement is added to compositional elements that  are contained within its underlying static  gridded structure. This means  that  Composition No. 12 with Blue cannot  be considered a grid,  as defined by Eckmann and  Koepnick, because viewers actually see movement occurring in the  form  of the  jittery  rhythm that emerges from the flickering intersections of the black perpendicular lines.
