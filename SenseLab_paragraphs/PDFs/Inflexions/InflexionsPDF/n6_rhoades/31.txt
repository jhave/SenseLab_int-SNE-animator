The   emergent  images   that   arise   from   the   shared  experience  between  the relational  complex of  Composition No.  12 with  Blue and  the  viewers are  more dynamic than  Eckmann and  Koepnick’s notion of either  grids  or matrices. Recall that Eckmann and Koepnick’s understanding of gridded images  assumes that the relationship between viewers and  artworks is based  on a notion of stability. For them,  viewers see  immutable images   when looking   at  gridded images.   Brian Massumi points out  that  if artworks are  assumed to be static,  this  affects  how vision is understood.
