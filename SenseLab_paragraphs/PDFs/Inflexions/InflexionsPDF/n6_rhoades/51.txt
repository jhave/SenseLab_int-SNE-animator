Landing  sites   are   not   only   constantly  configuring  what    viewers  visually experience when looking  at  Broadway Boogie Woogie, they  also  are  perpetually composing all the visual  experiences viewers have  of anything they  see, whether they  are  gridded images,   like  Mondrian’s paintings,  or  images   generated by matrices found in digital imaging, like Simon’s Every Icon. The encounter viewers have  with  a single  white  square in Every Icon generates a landing site that  is experienced in and  of itself.  This same encountered white  square is also a part  of a larger  composition of squares that  generates different landing sites for the experiencing. All of these  landing sites  that  are  felt in Every Icon, like  those  in Mondrian’s  paintings,  continually  shift   about   configuring  an  experience  for viewers, as  that  experience is  itself  emerging into  existence.   Whether images emerge  from   digital  means   or   with   paint,   everything  that   viewers  see   is constituted  in  the  shared  experience generated  through  the  encounter  with landing sites that  are felt as “a depositing of sited  awareness everywhere” (Gins and  Arakawa 2002: 7). Images  actively  emerge in midst of a shared encounter with the world that is infinitely populated with landing sites.
