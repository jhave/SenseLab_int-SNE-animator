When  looking  at Mondrian’s Composition No. 12 with Blue (1936-42), viewers will see that it is an almost  square painting (62 x 60.3 cm) comprising a complex black and  white  grid with  a snippet of blue near the bottom. The canvas  is filled with  a series    of    black    horizontal   and    vertical    lines    that    cross    one    another perpendicularly,  forming  the   grid   structure.  There   are   several   intersections resulting from  the six horizontal and  the seven  vertical  lines. These crisscrossing black    lines    give    the    appearance   of   slicing    the    white    background   into quadrilateral sections.  Near  the  bottom right  corner,  caught between two  of the black  vertical  lines  and  enclosed by black  lines  along  the top  and  the bottom, is the  only  coloured section,   a  square of  blue.  The  black  lines  along   the  blue square’s top  and  bottom edges  extend to the  right.  The bottom line  stops  after intersecting with  the  next  vertical  line.  Like the  line  at the  bottom, the  top  line intersects the  next  vertical   line  but  instead of  stopping, it  leaps   to  the  next vertical  line to continue to the edge of the canvas.
