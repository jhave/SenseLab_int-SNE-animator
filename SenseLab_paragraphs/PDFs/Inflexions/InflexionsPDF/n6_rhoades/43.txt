The array  of coloured and  white  planes that  compose Broadway Boogie Woogie, as well  as the  perpendicular lines,  the  grid,  and  the  irregular rhythm that  viewers experience  in  the  seeing,   might   be  considered  as  what   Madeline  Gins  and Arakawa  call  landing  sites.  According  to  Gins   and   Arakawa,  landing  sites designate “the ‘coming alive’… of anything whatsoever, including even the most fleeting  sensations” (2002: 6). As new  encounters are experienced between Broadway Boogie Woogie’s compositional elements, the gathering relations among the  elements and  viewers, more  landing sites  are  felt  in  the  seeing.  These  felt landing sites cannot  be specifically located.  They are not stable  places  that  can be mapped with  any  sort  of  precision. They  do  not  occur  in  or  on  Mondrian’s painting. Rather,  landing sites are what  constitute the composition of the experienced encounter, as they  are  being  experienced. Landing sites  generate a space  for experience to be felt, enabling viewers to “feel the vitality of reality  in everything that exists” (Mondrian 1986/1993:  387).
