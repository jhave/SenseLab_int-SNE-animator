When  Eckmann and  Koepnick distinguish those  features that  comprise gridded images,   like   Mondrian’s  Composition  No.  12  with   Blue,  from   those   images generated  by   matrices,  like   Simon’s   Every  Icon,  they   produce  a  series   of dichotomies.  [5]  Upon   closer  inspection,  the  opposition  between  the  visibly stable   images   of  modernist  grids   and   the  imperceptible  moving  matrices of digital images  begins  to unravel. The line that  demarcates gridded images  from those  images  generated by  matrices is not  solid  at  all.   Despite Eckmann and Koepnick’s conceptualization of grids  stated above,  Koepnick reveals  that, “whatever appears to  be  a  product of the  grid’s unyielding structure surreptitiously speaks of that  which  may  exceed  the  grid’s  rational order and control” (2006: 55). This  means  that  the  gridded images  of modernist painting, like  Composition  No.  12  with  Blue,  have   the   potential  to  reach   beyond  the structures that compose and  contain them.  [6] These works  generate a movement that  viewers experience through the activity  of seeing,  which  is in excess of their compositional structure.  There  are  excesses  in  the  seeing  that  go  beyond the limits of what  is actually painted on the canvas.
