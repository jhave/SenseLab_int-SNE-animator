The  digital matrix,  consisting of pixilated visual  bits  created by a binary code of numbers, transforms the static modernist grid  into a moving configuration, one that  is nevertheless still informed by the basic  structure of the  grid.  Yet, in contrast to the  modernist grid, the  digital matrix  may  remain invisible and  is capable  of forming images  independent from its own structure. (Eckmann 2006: 16) [3]
