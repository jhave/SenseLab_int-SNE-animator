Finally,  dimensional landing sites  are  the  sites  that  occur  between perceptual landing  sites   and    imaging  landing   sites.   Gins   and    Arakawa  state    that dimensional landing sites  combine “the  qualities of  a  perceptual landing site with   those   of  an   imaging  landing  one,   coupling  and   coordinating  direct responses  with    indirect  ones,   the   formed  with    the   formless”  (2002:  8). Dimensional landing sites  are  the  sites  of relation that  arrange the  spacing and the placing of all landing sites. They generate the depth and  emphasis necessary to  any  experience. In  Broadway Boogie Woogie, dimensional landing sites simultaneously  enable   viewers  to  take  in  the  composition  of  planes  on  the canvas,  feel the emergence of the dynamic irregular rhythm, and  see the perpendicular lines and the grid that this rhythm generates. Dimensional landing sites connect  the composition of planes to the irregular rhythm they  generate in the  seeing  and  bring  them  both  to  the  forefront of the  viewers’  experience in order  to  make   the   perpendicular  lines   and   the   grid   visible.   Without  these dimensional landing sites to coordinate the felt excesses  of imaging landing sites and  the perceived compositional elements of perceptual landing sites, the act of experiencing the world would be made  completely chaotic.
