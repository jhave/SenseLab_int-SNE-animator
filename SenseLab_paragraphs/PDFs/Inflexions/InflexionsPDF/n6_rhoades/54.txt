The experiences that  are shared between Mondrian’s paintings and  the  viewers are  provisionally tentative because at any  moment these  particular experiences can change or even vanish. When  Gins and  Arakawa discuss the tentativeness of the  biosphere, or what  they  call the  “bioscleave,” they  assert  that  if any  single element fails to hold,  then  this  could  potentially create  disastrous effects for the entire  planet. [11] Although the  consequences are  not  as  cataclysmic when a shared  viewer-artwork  experience does  not  take  hold,   emergent images   and shared  experiences  are   nonetheless  tentative  in   this   provisional  way.
