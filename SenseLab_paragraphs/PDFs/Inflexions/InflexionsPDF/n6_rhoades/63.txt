If perception unfolds how  Thompson believes,  then,  according to  Bergson,  it would “be inextensible; it would consist  of the assembling of certain  specific materials, in a given  quantity, and  we should never  find anything more  in it than what  had  been  put  there  in  the  first  place”  (2007: 113). Mondrian’s paintings would be no more  than  the paint  on the canvas  and  the grid  pattern it presents. Viewers  would not experience any movement when they  encounter either Composition No. 12 with Blue or Broadway Boogie Woogie. Yet the  excesses  in the seeing  present in the experience shared with  Mondrian’s paintings in the form of the  jittery   and   irregular  rhythms  extend  beyond  Thompson’s stable understanding  of  perception.  This  is  because  there   is  always  more   that   is experienced than  is directly perceived. As painter Bridget  Riley notes:  “We  feel with  our  eyes more  that  we see” (2009: 69, emphasis added). When  viewers gaze upon Mondrian’s paintings they  are  experiencing a seeing  that  exceeds  what  is actually visible.
