Because  landing sites are active  within every  shared experience with  and  within the world, rather than  attempting to classify  the images  as either  being  gridded or generated by matrices, all images  – digital, modernist or otherwise – should be considered to be what  Gins  and  Arakawa call “a tentative constructing towards a holding into place” (2002: 23ff., original emphasis). The images  emerging from  the shared experience between an artwork and  its viewers arise  from  the constantly shifting configurations of landing sites.  Because  everything that  is experienced changes as  the  landing sites  rearrange themselves, any  images  that  are  made visible   never   last   as   such   for   very   long.   As   Gins   and   Arakawa  explain: “Everything is tentative” (2002: 49). It is important to be mindful of the nuanced manner in which  Gins  and  Arakawa use  the  term  “tentative,” which  is defined by  them   in  both   its  provisional  and   hesitant  sense   (2002:  82).  Specifically, tentativeness should be understood provisionally as an  arrangement that  lacks fixity  and  hesitantly as  a  momentary pause. This  means   that  the  images  that viewers see when looking  at Mondrian’s Composition No. 12 with Blue or Broadway Boogie Woogie emerge as “a tentative constructing towards a holding into  place” that is provisionally “constructed” but that is also hesitantly “held.”
