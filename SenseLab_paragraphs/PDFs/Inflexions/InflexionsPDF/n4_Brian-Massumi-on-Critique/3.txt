I wanted to  follow  up  on  the  discussion thread about  the  organization of the event.  As a co-instigator of the  series  of events  and  a member of the  organizing committee,  I  bear   a  large   share   of  the   responsibility  for   the   “noncritical” approach. In view  of this,  I thought I might  explain some  of the  background to the adoption of that  approach, as I have  understood it. For me, there  were  three principal  starting  points.  The  first  was   the   distinction  that   Deleuze  makes between criticism  and  critique. The  second, entirely related to  the  first,  was  a statement by  Isabelle  Stengers that  she  rarely  accepts  invitations to  academic meetings  because  they   are  normally  structured  in  a  way   that   ensures  that nothing “important” (in Whitehead’s sense)  can happen. She went  on to say that she  only  accepts  when she  has  a sense  that  the  interaction is prepared so that something  actually  happens  that   is  truly   an   “event.”  Since  she   made   this statement in response to an invitation Erin  and  I had  just tendered, we figured we’d  better  start  thinking fast  and  seriously about  what  it might  mean  for  an academic or artistic  meeting to be an event,  and  pragmatically how  you go about setting in  place  the  conditions for  its  occurrence. Isabelle  did  come,  and  these questions became  the core of intense discussions with  her that  grew  to include a number of people who  would later become  participants and  co-organizers of last year’s Dancing the Virtual and  the upcoming Housing the Body. The third jumping off point  was  the  sense  that  part  of the  response to the  problem Isabelle  posed might  be found in the “radical” empirical call for our thought-practice to “be true
