In many  ways  the  aesthetics of my  videos  have  been  informed by forerunners who  were  filmmakers rather than  video  artists.    The  structure in each  piece  is based   on  sequences of  frames   predominantly,  and   likewise the  basic  unit  is usually  the  frame   rather  than   the  pixel,   the  line  or  the  signal.     There   are numerous films that  I could  cite as having been influential, stretching back to the classic abstract films of Hans  Richter  and  Walther Ruttmann made  in the 1920s. In thinking about  the way that I have used  colour  in particular, I have often come back to Sharitsâ€™ films, though the difference between the colour  in his films and my videos  - including consideration of the way that colour  is reproduced in these two  mediums - is as important as any  surface  similarity.21   In this  light  it is the use  of computer-generated colour  that  makes  my  work  specifically digital.  The colour  that  I have  used  from  Colour Bars onwards has a particular quality that  is different to colour  in film and  indeed analogue video:  it is bold,  substantive and opaque.22      Furthermore,  it  is  also  the  product of  an  ideal   palette  that   is  a mathematical construct.  Each colour  has  a specific  value  that  nominally relates to  a mixture of red,  green  and  blue  light.    But  there  is no  accounting for  the shades or intensities of colour  that one might  actually see in these videos.   One of
