absolutely filmic.  The most obvious and  significant point  is that  the colour  fields in Ray Gun  Virus  are  time-based and  sequenced.  Another factor,  which  I will come back to in different ways,  concerns the material characteristics of the colour stimuli. When  one is looking at a painting it seems as if the colour  is there  on the surface  of the canvas,  though it might  be more  proper to say that it is a particular patch   of  paint   under  given   lighting  conditions  that   constitutes  the   colour stimulus.  In contrast, the materials that  give rise to the phenomena of colour  in film – in the interaction between film print,  projector and  screen  – are composite and  less easy to pinpoint. The way in which  colour  is produced in video,  which  I come to later, is even more complex.
