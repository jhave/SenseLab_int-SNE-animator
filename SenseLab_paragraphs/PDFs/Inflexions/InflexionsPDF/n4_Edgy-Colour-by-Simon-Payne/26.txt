In  light   of  the  account  of  video   technology  and   colour   coding  above   it  is significant to note  that  both  Beck and  the Vasulkas had  a hand in building their own processing tools and  technologies, allowing them  to affect the coordinates of the video  image  including its colour.9   The video  synthesiser that  Beck designed and   developed  to   produce  Video  Weavings   allowed  for   the   processing  of algorithms,  in  real-time, that  would  generate patterns  analogous to  those   of woven textiles.   The scanning line of the video  signal  could  be seen as equivalent to the warp and  weft of a weaver’s loom  (Beck, n.d.).   The coloured squares and rectangles, which  are the  basic components of the  work’s evolving patterns, are elementary digital forms  that were produced by the digital processing of the analogue  signal.     The  small  blocks  of  colour   in  tessellated patterns  produce
