The videos  36 (2001) by Norbert Pfaffenbichler and  Lotte  Schrieber and  uta zet (2001) by reMI (Renate  Oblak  and  Michael  Pinter)  represent two contrasting approaches to  colour  digital imaging in  recent  work.    One  thing  that  both  of these  pieces  have  in common with  the  earlier  work  of Beck and  the  Vasulkas is that they were  produced by directly engaging with  the technology - though it is a matter  of  programming  rather  more   than   building hardware.    36  plots   the parameters of digital imaging in a manner that  is akin to the first passages of the Vasulkasâ€™  video,   which   cycles  through the  permutations of  form  and   colour within a given  grid.    The flat graphic composition of the  piece  is organized in terms  of a rectangle that is set in from the edge of the frame  by a grey border and split  into  three  sections:  a black  square, a white  lattice,  and  a stripe  that  runs along  the base of the rectangle that  is effectively  a time  signature.  These  shapes are static  forms  upon which  the  algorithms of the  piece  are played out.   Thirty-
