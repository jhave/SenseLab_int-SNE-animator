minus blue  and  Y' minus red  information respectively.  The benefit  of Y'CBCR encoding is  that  it  allows   for  chroma subsampling -  a  form  of  compression whereby values  for CB and  CR are sampled less frequently than  (Y') - resulting in a signal  with  a lower  data  rate than  that  of a full RGB signal.   (Values  for CB and CR  might  be  sampled at two  thirds or  even  half  as many  times  as that  of Y'). Note  that  CB  and  CR  are  not  colour  indices,  but  calculated figures  from  which colour  information can be reproduced.   Imagery that  is encoded in Y'CBCR is translated back  into  an RGB colour  space  when it is displayed in the  red,  green and  blue lattice of the video  screen,  as described above.5
