discrete frames;   the  perceptual effect  of  clashing frames   makes   a  conceptual point  about  the materiality of film.  In certain  passages of the film two modes of colour  mixing  - the  fades/dissolves and  the  flicker  of alternating colour  - come together. These are the most dynamic and  complex passages of the film. In some sequences the  colour  of  every  other  frame  remains constant while  a  dissolve between  two   different  colours   occurs   over   the   intermittent  frames;   other sequences involve interwoven dissolves.  There  are very few films that  explore  a
form of frame-based colour  mixing  in such an expansive and  thorough manner.
