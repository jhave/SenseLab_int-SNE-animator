20  Fascinating examples of motion perception have  been  collated and  examined by  Professor George  Mather online.    The  example referred to  as  “four-stroke apparent motion” is particularly striking and shows  that it is edges  of contrasting luminance rather than  shape that  directs  the perception of movement.
