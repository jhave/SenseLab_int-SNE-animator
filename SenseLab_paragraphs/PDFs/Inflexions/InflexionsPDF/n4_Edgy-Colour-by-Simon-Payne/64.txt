16  Chroma subsampling is effectively  a form  of intraframe compression. Rather than  storing the discrete value  of every  pixel in a frame,  intraframe compression economizes by calculating and  saving  the differences between pixels. In contrast, interframe compression saves  space  by storing the  difference between pixels  in subsequent frames.   While  Thirds et al. can be compressed very  efficiently  using intraframe methods, the  alternating colour  fields  make  interframe compression incompatible.  In so far as high  definition imagery is often  fetishized, and  video is primarily a time-based medium, this seems quite  fitting  to me.
