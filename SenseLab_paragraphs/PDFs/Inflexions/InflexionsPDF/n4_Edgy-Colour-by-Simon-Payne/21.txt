Fig. 4 A waveform monitor image, measuring luminance, corresponding to the  seven stripes of the  colour barsâ€™  test  signal. (nb.  White is a mixture of green, red and blue;  yellow is a mixture of green and red;  cyan  is a mixture of green and blue;  and magenta is a mixture red and blue.)  The downward staircase shown in the  waveform monitor image of the colour bars  is explained by the fact  that   green  makes  the   greatest  contribution  to  the   luminance  portion  of  a  video  signal followed by red and blue.
