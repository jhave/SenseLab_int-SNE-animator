21  There  are  aspects of Sharits’  approach and  thinking about  film  that  could  be described as proto-digital.  In his essay  “Words per  Page”,  for example, Sharits describes the filmstrip as a “vector” or “continuous” form,  and  the frame-rate of the  projector  as instigating a “modular” form  (1978: 35).   The same  distinction could  be used  to describe digital video:  the  video  signal  is a continuous stream while  the pixels  along  each line are akin  to modular units.   Despite this analogy colour  is produced by completely different means  in film  and  video,  as I have already suggested.
