To return to the  specifics  of processing colour  as digital data,  one  ought to ask what  it  means   that  colour  can  be  plotted in  terms   of  a  precise  mathematical model,  where  every   colour   within  the   gamut  can   be  defined  by  a  set  of coordinates.   One  answer to  this  question is that  white  and  black  are  specific numerical coordinates located in opposite corners of the three-dimensional cube that  describes an  RGB colour  space.    In a Y'CBCR   colour  space  luminance (the greyscale between white  and  black)  is actually one  of the  axes. Similarly,  if one pictures the  colour   bars  on  a  waveform monitor  white   and   black  represent opposite ends  of the  video  spectrum. White  and  black are therefore colours  and not only qualities of light and dark.6
