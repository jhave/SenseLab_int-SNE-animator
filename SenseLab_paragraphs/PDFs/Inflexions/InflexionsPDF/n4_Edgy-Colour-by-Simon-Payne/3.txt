This  essay  stems  from  thoughts concerning my  own  colour  field  videos,  from Colour Bars (2004) through to Iris Out  (2008).   My  main  intention is to unravel some  of the  implications relating to the  aesthetic characteristics of colour  that  is processed as digital data.   The first part  of the essay is about  differences between film colour,  video  screens,  digital processing and  the relation between these technologies and  the neurophysiology of colour  perception. There are sections  in this  part  that  are slightly tentative, as I am quite  lost when it comes  to the  finer points of electronic engineering and  neuroscience, but  it strikes  me  that  some understanding of these fields is important. I have also written about  colour  from a more  empirical perspective, from the point  of view  of someone concerned with trying  to  describe the  immediate effects  of  certain   artistsâ€™  films  and   videos, including my  own.    In  this  regard, the  essay  deals  with  the  use  and  effect  of colour  in a number of experimental films and  videos,  focusing on form and  time- based  structures that  concern the  sequencing of frames  on  a filmstrip and  the more  intricate matrix  of the pixels,  lines, fields and  frames  of a video  signal.   The examples that  are covered also contextualize my  own  work,  which  is discussed towards the end of the essay.
