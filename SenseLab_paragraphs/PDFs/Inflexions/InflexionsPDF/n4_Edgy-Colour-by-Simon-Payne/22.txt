Besides the aesthetics of colour  mixing  per se, the following sections  of the essay deal with  the ways  in which  certain  works  construct an experience of colour  that is  mathematically  coded.    Many   of  the   videos   that   are   discussed  involve processes and  structures that  produce an experience of colour  that  would seem to be at odds  with  the  precision implied by digital imaging.  Broader questions might  be raised if one were  to deal with  videos  that incorporate camera-recorded imagery, but in this instance I have  sought to concentrate on works  involving computer-generated colour.
