in image  quality, for example, when one made  copies of a work  from one tape  to another.7   Now  that video  is a fully digital medium it comes with  a colour  palette that  has  a precise  frame  of reference: 8-bit colour  will reproduce 256 gradations of red,  green  and  blue,  making for  a palette of 16,777,216 colours  (256 x 256 x
256), each  with  a unique numerical value.  In theory digital video  provides for colours  that are infinitely reproducible and  highly  controllable. In what  follows  I will  compare the  use  of colour  in a number of digital video  works,  beginning with  two very early pieces: Stephen Beck’s Video Weavings (1976) and  Woody and Steina Vasulka’s  Digital Images (1978).8
