but their  colour  is arbitrary; any two colours  could  be used  to illustrate the same point.  In a later  passage complementary colours  are  used  to display a range  of simple  geometric shapes and  patterns: one example is a pink  ‘E’ shape on a cyan background.   Here   the  choice  of  colours   is  less  arbitrary as  complementary colours  show  the  pattern most  vividly, though any  complementary colour  pair could  be used  to the  same  effect.   A series  of these  shapes in quick  succession, using  different pairs  of colours,  makes  for an intriguing effect, but the video  does not explore  optical  phenomena per  se.    Instead it highlights the formal characteristics of images  that  result  from  technological intervention.  In  a later section  of the  video,  the  output of the  Digital  Image  Articulator is plugged into the  input,  forming a  feedback loop  that  results in  multi-coloured horizontal, vertical  and  diagonal bars,  lines  and  dashes that  create  a crazy  shifting tartan pattern.  The  hovering colours  are  unpredictable and  the  relationship between form  and  colour  is randomized and  made  completely unstable.  The advantage of  digital imaging is  that  form,  colour   and   sequencing  are  made   calculable, precise   and   reproducible,  but  in  this  passage the  logic  of  the  Digital   Image Articulator, and digital processing in general, is thrown off kilter.
