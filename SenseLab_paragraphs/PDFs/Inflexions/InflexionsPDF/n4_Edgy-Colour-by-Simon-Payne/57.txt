9   According to  Yvonne  Spielmann, the  essence  of  video  is  the  bare  electronic signal,  which  can  be  processed and  output in  numerous ways.    The  standard presentation of the video  image  is an arbitrary arrangement of the video  signal  - or one governed by convention rather than  necessity.  See her recent  book Video: The Reflexive Medium (2008). Woody Vasulkaâ€™s  C-Trend (1974) is a prime example that  shows  the  extent  to which  the  video  image  can be contorted.  In this  piece the signal  was  processed in such  a way  as to skew  and  apparently tilt the raster to produce what  looks  like a three  dimensional map  with  the lines of the image tracing contours.
