While many  of Sharitsâ€™ films involve iconographic imagery, Ray Gun Virus is one of his most abstract works.   It begins  with  a pattern of alternating black and  clear frames.     Subtle   tonal   variations  are  introduced  and   then   colour.     The  film involves a  myriad range   of  colours,   from  pastel   shades through to  saturated hues,  in varying and  complex sequences.  In some  passages of the film there  are periods of uninterrupted monochromatic colour.   There  are  also sections  in the film   where  colours   fade   in/out   or   steadily  dissolve.    These   passages  are particularly intriguing if one looks at the filmstrip itself.   Fades  and  dissolves evidently result  from  incremental differences between individual frames  - but at what  point  does one colour  become  another in sequences such as these; and  what of the colours  in between?
