six white  dashes sit on the black square, while  the white  lattice holds  a palette of colours  from  across  the  spectrum of an  8-bit  digital colour  palette.   The  piece begins  with  the  white   dashes being  set  in  motion, traveling across  the  black square along  horizontal and  vertical  paths.  On the right-hand side of the image, the  colours  begin  to weave  through the  white  lattice,  and  newly  mixed  colours appear in each  swatch.   The movement of the  dashes on  the  left of the  screen makes  for  different alignments.   At  various points the  horizontal and  vertical dashes cross paths, pause and  mark  specific coordinates.  The video  develops in a  manner  that   is  thoroughly   systematic:  the  horizontal  and   vertical   dashes eventually coalesce and form six white  squares; and  the weave  through the white lattice  stops  once  all the  colours  in the  palette have  been  mixed.    It is the  right hand side of the screen  that  is of most  concern here.   Once the piece is in motion it  is  ablaze   with   colour   mixing,   producing  innumerable  hues.     The  colour swatches  shift   horizontally  and   vertically though  the   lattice,   which   almost disappears when the weaving is at its most  intense.  At the same  time the colour mixing  is still contained by the white  lattice  and  the fact that  it is set in from  the edge of the screen.   In this respect the video  offers something of a theoretical demonstration of the colour  combinations that  might  be produced by the technology.   As far  as the  logic  of the  work  is concerned the  optical  nature of colour  mixing  is neither here nor there.
