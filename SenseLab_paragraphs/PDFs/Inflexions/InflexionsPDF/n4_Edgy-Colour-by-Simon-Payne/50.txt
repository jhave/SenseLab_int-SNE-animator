3   Some  of  the  earliest   experiments in  film  colour   used   processes of  additive colour  mixing  that  were  quite  similar.  The Kinemacolor process first exhibited in
1908, for  example, involved shooting and  then  projecting  through alternating
coloured filters (Enticknap 2005: 80). The “motion fringing” that often occurred is not unlike  the flicker effect produced by single chip DLPs.
