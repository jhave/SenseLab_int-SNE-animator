Both   Beck  and   the   Vasulkas  could   be   seen   as   latter   day   constructivists, investigating and  working with  the component parts  of the medium and  its technology.  The major  difference between the  two  is that  Beck’s  is an  applied and    highly    decorative   art:    digital   processes   have    been    designed   and implemented by the  artist  to produce a particular pattern that  might  be used  in numerous  ways.11     In  contrast,  much   of  the  Vasulkas’  work   is  analytic  and represents a quasi-scientific endeavour.  It is in this vein that Woody Vasulka has characterized his work  as “anti  art”.12   In Digital Images the  component colours are  used   to  define   the  formal   structures of  the  image   and   demonstrate the capacity of digital processing.  Though the feedback patterns in the later  section are the antithesis of the earlier  geometric shapes, they  are the result  of the same kind  of technological enquiry.   In  Video Weavings,  the  shapes and  colours  are absolutely specific to the patterns generated by the processes of the work.  In this light,  Video Weavings fits the  West  Coast  tradition of abstract cinema  that  goes
