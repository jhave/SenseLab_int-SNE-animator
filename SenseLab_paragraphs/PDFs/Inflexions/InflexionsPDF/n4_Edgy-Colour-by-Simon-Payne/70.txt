22 The colour  on the surface  of a filmstrip is transparent, but film colour  also has an  air  of transparency on  screen.    Digital  video  colour,  by  comparison, seems more  opaque.  “Is there  any reason why  video  colour,  in your  piece particularly, looks    more    opaque   than    film   colour    – more    like   gouache  rather   than watercolour?”  This was  a question posed by film historian David  Curtis  after  a screening in Edinburgh in May 2008.  One answer to this might  be to do with  the evenness of colour  in the pixels  of a digital video  image  where there  are areas  of unvarying colour.    In contrast, the  randomised pattern of grain  in a film  print means  that apparently uniform surfaces of colour  are in fact quite  animated.
