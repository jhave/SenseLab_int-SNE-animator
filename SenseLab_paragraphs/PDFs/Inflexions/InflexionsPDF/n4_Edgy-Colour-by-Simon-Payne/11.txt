reference.  In contrast, the  colour  in a video  image  has  no immediate reference. Unlike  the medium of the filmstrip, the video  signal  is colourless. In fact a video signal  is not just colourless but invisible.  (The amplitude of a video  signal  can be measured but  one  cannot exactly  see  a video  signal).    The  difference between colour  in film and  video,  and  where it seems  to inhere, reflects  one  of the  most significant differences between the  two  mediums.  In contrast to the  colour  in a projected film, the colour  in a video  image  is a product of the output technology rather than  the  video  signal  per  se.   And  while  the  production of colour  in  a filmstrip is a subtractive process (in which  incidental light  has  been  filtered by different layers  of light  sensitive emulsion) the range  of colour  in a video  image is produced by  the  additive mixture of separate sources of red,  green  or  blue light that  emanate from the technology of the screen.   The optical  mixture of red, green  and  blue  light  can produce any  colour  in the  visible  spectrum.1   Looking closely  at a video  image  on a cathode ray tube,  or a flat screen  monitor, one can clearly see the clusters of small closely spaced red, green  and blue cells that make up its surface.2
