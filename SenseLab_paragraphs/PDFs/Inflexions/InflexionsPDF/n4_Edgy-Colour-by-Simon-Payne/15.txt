Colour is an even more  complex affair at the level of signal  processing.  A digital video  image  is sampled in three  respects: the  time  axis is sampled into  frames; the vertical  axis of the picture is sampled into lines; and  a number of equidistant points,  or  pixels,   are  sampled  along   each  line.     For  example,  the  standard definition signal  in the  UK operates at 25 frames  per  second, and  has  576 lines devoted to the vertical  axis of the picture, each of which  are sampled 720 times. In a greyscale image  each pixel represents a value  associated with  the brightness, or  rather luminance, of that  point.4    A colour  image  effectively  requires three different signals  that  reproduce the  proportion of  red,  green  and  blue  at  any given  point  in a picture.  But rather than  process separate red,  green  and  blue values  for  each  pixel  of the  sampled image,  digital video  is often  encoded in relation to  Y'CBCR   coordinates, which  entails  a further level  of abstraction.   A Y'CBCR  signal  encodes a ‘luma’ component (Y') associated with  the luminance of the image,  and  two colour  difference components (CB and  CR).  Y' is the weighted sum  of the  red,  green  and  blue  information, while  CB  and  CR  represent the  Y'
