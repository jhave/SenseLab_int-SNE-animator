Fig. 3 RGB colour space  can be mapped onto  a three dimensional cube.  Red, green and blue values are represented by the three primary axes that  originate at black  and reach saturation at their end points. If this cube  displayed an 8-bit colour model, which reproduces 256 gradations of red,  green and blue,  the numerical value attributed to red would be (255, 0, 0) green (0, 255, 0) and blue  (0, 0, 255).  The values for black  and white would be (0, 0, 0) and (255, 255, 255) respectively.
