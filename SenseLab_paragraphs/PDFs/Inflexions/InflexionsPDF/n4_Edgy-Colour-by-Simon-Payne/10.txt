In watching Ray Gun Virus the viewer is encouraged to reflect on the mixture of colours  that  they  see on  the  screen  in relation to the  pattern of frames  running through the projector.  The colour  in a projected film image  is produced by light shining through the dyed medium of a semi-transparent filmstrip, and  it will be affected  by  the  hue  of the  projector  bulb  and  the  scale  at  which  the  image  is projected,  but   it  is  the  colour   in  the  filmstrip  that   constitutes  the  primary
