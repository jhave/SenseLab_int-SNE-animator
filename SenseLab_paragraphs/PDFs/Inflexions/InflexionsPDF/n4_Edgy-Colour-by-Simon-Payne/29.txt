Many  of the  Vasulkaâ€™s  videotapes, from  the  early  1970s onwards, document the aesthetic possibilities resulting from  image  processing tools.   Digital Images is an explicitly didactic piece  that  explains the  parameters of  digital processing by using  the  Digital  Image  Articulator designed by Jeffrey Shier,  who  also appears in the  video.10    In the  first  part  of this  video  Shier  demonstrates how  a binary division of the raster  results in a scalable  grid.   The description is fascinating and instructive in terms  of its explaining the  fundamental concept of digital image processing, which  is as relevant to contemporary digital imaging technology.  In the  opening  section   of  the  video   horizontal  stripes are  used   to  display  the divisions of vertical  axis, and  vertical  stripes are used  to display the divisions of the  horizontal axis.   The bars  that  demarcate these  divisions are  black  and  red,
