television imagery also  creeps  into  the  mix.   reMI’s  work  is aggressively anti- digital  in  the   sense   that   it  counters  the   rational  interfaces  of  new   media technology (which  36 evokes)  and  the seamless aesthetics associated with  digital compositing  and   high   definition  video.      It  is  set  on  the   degradation  and deformation of the video  image  and  implies a critique of the medium. In seeking to unravel the weave  of the video  image,  the destructive impulse in this work  is the  antithesis of Beck’s Video Weavings.   The colour  in uta zet is as brilliant and vibrant as that  in Video Weavings, but it certainly isn’t decorative; nor is it used  to map  or highlight the  formal-technological principles of video  imaging as in the Vasulkas’  work.    In many  respects the  colour  is a by-product of processes that have been implemented to distort and  degenerate the video  signal.   In contrast to the  era in which  Beck and  the Vasulkas made  their  first digital video  works,  36 and  uta zet were  made  at the cusp  of the present period in which  moving digital imagery is everywhere.  36 restated the  underlying patterns of digital imaging, and  uta zet stood  in reaction to it.
