The  processed video  signal  determines the  intensity of each  of the  cells,  often referred to as pixels,  and  colours  are  mixed  when one  is far enough back  from the screen.  Projection technologies such as LCD (liquid crystal  display) and DLP(digital light  processing) mix  colours  additively as well,  but  in a different fashion.   In the  former, the  light  of the  projector  bulb  is split  three  ways  by  a prism and  each beam  of polarized light  is sent through one of three  LCD panels that  corresponds to either  the  red,  green  or blue  component of the video  signal. The pixels  in the  surface  of each  of these  panels are  opened or closed  to allow more  or less light  through at each point  in the plane  of the image.   The resultant red, green  and blue light is then  recombined and  cast onto the screen  through the lens.   In the  latter,  a three-chip DLP projector  works  in the  similar  way  except that  each  beam  of polarized light  is reflected, or  deflected, by  the  microscopic mirrors on one of three  panels.  In a single  chip  DLP projector there  is only  one panel  of micromirrors, which  display the  three  separate colour  components of the  video  signal  in turn.
