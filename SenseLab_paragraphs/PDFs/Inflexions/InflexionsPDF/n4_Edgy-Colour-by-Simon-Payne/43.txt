of movement is cued by luminance signals,  rather than  colour.   The eye and brain apparently detect  motion by tracking edges  that  entail  a contrast in luminance; shape has nothing to do with  it and  nor does  colour.20  However, in recognizing and  describing motion one cannot help  but  attach  it to objects.   The same  is true of colour.   And  to say that  we perceive the trace of edges  with  a high  luminance contrast, rather than  the  movement of coloured objects,  seems  counterintuitive. But in Colour Bars, Thirds, New Ratio and  Iris Out it is certainly not the motion of coloured shapes that  one sees because the change in the position and  size of each shape – be  they  stripes, rectangles, or  circles  – is radically different from  one frame  to the  next.   The perception of movement really  does  become  a matter of following edges,  rather than  colour  and  form.   At the same  time  it is impossible to separate one’s sense  of movement from  that  of form  and  colour.  We do see in colour  after  all.   In  this  regard, there  is a tension between colour,  shape and movement in each of these videos.
