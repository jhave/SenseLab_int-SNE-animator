ways of remembering. This flexibility between memory and movement is a reminder, I think, about how necessary it is to keep the flow between the micro and the macro, between that which is in creation and that which exists more concretely and can be represented. It is a reminder that even that which seems to represent carries within it the seeds of its own potential subversion. In this sense, we cannot think outside the vocabulary of singularities as serialities. Everything that is experienced is micropolitical in one way or another. How  we speak of it or write about it or use it politically may have a macropolitical orientation, but any fissure, any opening always speaks of renewed micropolitical potential.
