I think that the military, for example in both the U.S. and Israel, has an understanding of how the micropolitical works in relation to a milieu. What I mean by this is that the military has come up with very sophisticated techniques in relation to how war affects and infects— technologically, architecturally and cartographically (take for example Eyal Weizman’s work  on the architecture of occupation in Palestine and also how much that influenced the architecture of occupation in Iraq, or for example the “Arab” simulation villages that have been built in the deserts of Nevada and the infamous “Chicago” base in Israel), and academically (take the RAND corporation for example, the not for profit institution for research and development playing a key role in implementing and influencing policies and decision making for the US government). We see how the micropolitical in this case is working intensely with the macropolitics of warfare. We really see how the
micropolitical and macropolitical are in constant relation, composing the
“becoming­work” of politics.
