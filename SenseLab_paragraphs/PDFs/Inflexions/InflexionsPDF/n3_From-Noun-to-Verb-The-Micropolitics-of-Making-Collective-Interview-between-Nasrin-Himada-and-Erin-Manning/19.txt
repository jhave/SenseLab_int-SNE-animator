For a micropolitics of collective enunciation, it seems that what is required is a grasping of the potential before it can be regulated within the dominant system of the day. The notion that the micro and the macro are always intertwined – something Lazzarato explains beautifully in his interview – is what makes the concept of the micropolitical so generative for me. The generative potential of the micropolitical is strengthened, I think, by its capacity to be captured by the macropolitical and deployed within various universes of value. This allows it to remain mobile and resist becoming didactic. Its potential, as Massumi points out, “is immediately collective. It’s not a mere possibility, it’s an active part of the constitution of that situation, it’s just one that hasn’t been fully developed, that hasn’t been fully capacitated for unfolding. This means that there are potential alter­politics at the collectively in­braced heart of every situation, even
the most successfully conformist in its mode of attunement.”
