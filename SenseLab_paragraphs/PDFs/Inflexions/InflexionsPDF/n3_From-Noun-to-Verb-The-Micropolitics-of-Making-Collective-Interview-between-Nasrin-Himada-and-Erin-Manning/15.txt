Politics and perception come together in this non­conscious re­jigging. It is non­conscious in the way that affect is, working not on the pre­constituted body, but on the in­bracing of the body­becoming. In this betweenness of feeling and doing, there is no content as yet. In Massumi’s words: “That affective quality is all there is to the world in that instant. It takes over life, fills the world, for an immeasurable instant of shock. Microperception is this purely affective rebeginning of the world.”
