Adam Bobbette gives a nice example of technique in an artistico­political context. In his description of the cocoons he creates, he mentions that they were originally built for squatters in New York City. The cocoon was thought as a make­shift shelter that could act as a mobile home free to move from  surface to surface (from  the ground to the tree, for instance). The technique, as he points out, is not the cocoon as such. It’s the making­mobile of the idea of home or shelter or even simply momentary safety. “It could be used for anything,” he writes, “and it could be made from  just about anything.” The flexibility of the cocoon is part of its technicity. What emerges through the cocoon emerges across the modalities of its deployment. As he says, “it's really  a very flexible object.”
