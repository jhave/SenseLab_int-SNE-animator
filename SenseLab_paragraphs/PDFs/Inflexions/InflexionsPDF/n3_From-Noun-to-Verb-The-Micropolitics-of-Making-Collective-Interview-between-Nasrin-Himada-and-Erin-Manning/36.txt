‘aesthetico­political’ event would take the form  of a micropolitical resistance to what Guattari may have called a ‘pseudo­scientific’
‘enslavement’ of thought and learning.” Seeking to go beyond “benchmark” culture – the endless measuring, aligning and evaluating that has become synonymous with academia – the Sydney molecule created a manual for thought­generation through a fine­tuned list of micro­behaviours/contagious comportments. These micro­behaviours include taking on someone else’s microbehaviours by differentially attuning to them, modulating the contagion that results from  these new thought processes, thus  creating “a patchwork existential territory with which you feel comfortable, but which gives you new powers.” The Sydney molecule’s instruction manual depends on a continuous flow between micro and macropolitical contexts and reminds us that the micro taken as didactic becomes a representation of itself (“don’t so much imitate it – certainly don’t mimic it”).
