Essence is a macropolitical concept. It engages at the level of fabulation, creating an ideal milieu with a retrospectively continuous history. Through essence, we come to the vocabularies that define, that situate the absoluteness of a concept such as native, woman, national etc. Singularities, on the other hand, are unique convergences that appear as remarkable points. This appearance is brief and completely depends on the conditions of the convergence. When it perishes it can never be resuscitated, and yet, similarly to Whiteheadâ€™s subjective form,  it can have an effect on future singularities.
