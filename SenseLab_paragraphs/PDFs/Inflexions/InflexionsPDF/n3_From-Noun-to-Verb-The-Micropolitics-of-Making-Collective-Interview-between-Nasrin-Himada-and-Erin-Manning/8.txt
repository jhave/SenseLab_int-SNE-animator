This idea of flexibility is key to micropolitics. Flexibility is not a moral standard. As Maurizio Lazzarato points out, debt is a technique used by governments to promote an individualization of society through a resubjectification of the individual.  Debt is a pliable technique which is indefinitely flexible, its flexibility key to its deployment by techniques of governmentality – as we’ve seen in the 2008­2009 economic crisis. Maurizio Lazzarato talks about debt’s flexibility in terms of how debt creates and is used to mobilize regimes of subjectivity. “[Debt],” he says, “is an economic technique and a technique for the production or the control of subjectivity.” It’s important to underline this mutability of technique, I think, to make it clear that the micropolitical is neither the smaller version of the political, nor its moral standard. The micropolitical passes through the political at different levels with different effects. It is, as Brian Massumi says, “a perception of a qualitatively different kind.”
