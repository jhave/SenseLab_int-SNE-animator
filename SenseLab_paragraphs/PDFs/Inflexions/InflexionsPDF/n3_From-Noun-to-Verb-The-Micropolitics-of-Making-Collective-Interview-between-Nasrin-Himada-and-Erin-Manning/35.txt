This paradox is beautifully addressed in the Sydney molecule’s “Generating Thought Experiment” – one of the micropolitical interventions that was part of the SenseLab event, Society of Molecules. Taking as a conceptual point of departure Suely Rolnik and Felix Guattari’s Molecular Revolution in Brazil, Mat Wall­Smith, Anna Munster, Andrew Murphie, Gillian Fuller and Lone Bertelsen take on the very idea of form  and representation through the prism  of “learning, research and thought across institutions.” One of the mandates of Society of Molecules was to try to think with, against and across institutions. The idea was to create techniques that might enable an undoing of the strict  micro (ethico­aesthetic) /macro (institution) perspective, since this strict dichotomy leaves us paralyzed in the face of institutions. To demonize the institution, as Bruno Latour and Isabelle Stengers point out, does not give us the tools with which to
subvert it or to open it to its micropolitical potential.
