As well as the Israeli architect Eyal Weizman.  Weizman recently wrote an article called Lawfare, which he wrote in March of 2009 shortly  after the assault on Gaza in December 2008­January 2009. This piece illustrates how the micropolitical works  macropolitically. And yes, as you mentioned earlier, micropolitics is not something to simply idealize or fetishize, and Deleuze and Guattari have warned us of this that micropolitics has the tendency to become microfascist. Weizman’s article brings this to light in some way.
