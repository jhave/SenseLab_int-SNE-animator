EM: Brian Massumi’s interview addresses this question in some detail and raises some issues I think would be interesting to discuss in the ethico­ aesthetic context of collective micropolitical intervention. The micropolitical, he says,  never registers consciously. In this sense, it is akin  to microperception, which registers only in its effects. This does not mean that micropolitical interventions cannot be planned, that precise and rigorous techniques cannot be invented. It means that what is
micropolitical about the event will never be known as such. It will be felt, it
will have an effect, but it won’t be in the strict sense of the term. Massumi calls this a “something doing”: “There is always a something­doing cutting in, interrupting whatever continuities are in progress. For things to
continue, they have to re­continue. They have to re­jig around the
interruption. At the instant of re­jigging, the body braces for what will come. It in­braces, in the sense that it returns to its potential for more of life to come, and that potential is immanent to its own arising.”
