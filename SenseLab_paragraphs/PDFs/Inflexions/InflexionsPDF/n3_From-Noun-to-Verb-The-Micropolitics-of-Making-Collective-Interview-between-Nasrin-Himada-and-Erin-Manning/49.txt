different happened. Not  only did the dropping of the leaflets serve to warn people to evacuate – as it had in the past. Now,  the leaflets also had a legal component: if the civilians chose not to evacuate they were
considered to have opted for the fight. To stay behind, to go back to your
house to protect it, meant, according to an international law division officer, that you were a “legitimate target.” In this case, lawfare doesn’t humanize war, as these experts claim it does (whatever this means anyway), but proliferates and justifies it. The range of violence and destruction becomes elastic in the context of how law, in this case, becomes malleable.
