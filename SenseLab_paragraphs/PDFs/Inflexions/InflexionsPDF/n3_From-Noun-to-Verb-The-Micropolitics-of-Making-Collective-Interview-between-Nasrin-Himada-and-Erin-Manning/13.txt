NH: In the interview with Adam Bobbette he talks about the relation between politics and art  as having to do with perception, and I think this links well to the relation between thought and practice. He says, “What I have been learning from  Smithson, and which you find taken up by so many others (including Deleuze and de Landa) is that politics is always enacted through perception.  It must allow particular kinds of worlds to be sensible while foreclosing others.  Here then, politics crosses the threshold of aesthetics.  And so what then might it be to practice on perception, what other kinds of worlds become perceptible?” How do you think we might engage with this idea of the relation between politics and perception in the context of a micropolitics?
