The danger of the idea of the common – which only begins to become interesting if we move it toward the notion of the commons – is that there is a presumption that the project pre­exists the problematic. The common claim is to know in advance what is at stake. To predefine the project in this way subverts any potential for creating a new set of problems. The project, in these terms, can only be deciphered, categorized, judged within the frame of its preexistence. Techniques, on the other hand, are always immanent to the event in its unfolding. They are not equal to all
tasks and must therefore be reinvented each time. Techniques are neither specifically political nor artistic nor  ethical. They move across, emphasizing points of emergence or singularization. Techniques thus  potentially create conditions for a singular unfolding of the event.
