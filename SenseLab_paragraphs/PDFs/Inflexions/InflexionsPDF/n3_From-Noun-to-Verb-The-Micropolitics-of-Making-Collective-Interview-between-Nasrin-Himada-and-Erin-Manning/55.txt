The building of walls is a good example of how events in one place are intrinsically connected to those in other places – how the local meets the global. Walls can be thought of as systems of thought/systems of power that are perpetually creating the “have nots” of the world, isolating and containing them. For example, the Israeli wall is not just a Palestinian problem. Of course, it’s specific to Palestine and the occupation, but it’s also proliferating similar initiatives all over the world. Mike Davis  brings attention to this. New walls are being built in Saudi Arabia at its border with Yemen, in India at its border with Kashmir and Bangladesh, Bhutan is walling its border with India, Botswana is building an electric fence alongside its border with Zimbabwe, Costa Rica has walled its border at Penas Blancas, and then there is the long fence along the Mexican­ America border, some of it still unbuilt, but all of it very much a part of the Mexico­America divide. The significance of this is overwhelming—not because it’s new, it’s not, we’ve seen this happen elsewhere and in different forms,  with gated communities, and new urban development strategies—. But what is significant about this particular set of wall construction is that the walls are emerging from  the context of the global economy of warfare and occupation.
