EM: As you point out, collaborative work  must pay attention to the point of inflexion where singularities appear. We see a nice example of this in Barbara Glowczewski’s discussion of the film she made during her first stay
­ in the late 1970s – in the Aboriginal community of Lajamanu, Australia. The important lesson Glowczewski learned through the process of making art  in a different cultural context was that one aesthetic system could not be simply  superimposed onto another. Explaining her rationale of using a jumpy, sped­up editing style, she says: “For the film I made in Lajamanu in
1979, I thought to use that technique because of a stupid analogy: I
thought the use of time condensation through rhythmic cuts would be like the condensation in dreams. Dreaming is so important for Aboriginal people, and I thought if we condense a lot of visual  information into one image it should sort of explain visually what the dream is about.” Despite Glowczewski’s best intensions, the Aborigines were confused about the representation of their dancing in her film. They thought it undermined
their dancing ritual and made them look stupid. “Their response to the film made clear that the representation ‘in time’ of their  movement was a key aspect of the content of their ritual. For them what was important was the real speed of the performance, of the enactment, of the dance because the speed at which you enact the traveling from  one place to another itself carries information.” As I think Glowczewski’s example makes apparent, processes create their own singularities. As Glowczewski’s
artistic practice evolved within Aboriginal communities, so did  her capacity to attend to the singularities as they emerged and to find modes of re­telling that sought less to represent their practices than to
collaborate with them.
