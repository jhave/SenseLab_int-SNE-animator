I have a problem with the idea of everyone picking their own
battleground and fighting for it. I think this is a strange approach—activism in fragments.  I think what is important, and what I think is difficult and
most challenging, is what Guattari adamantly calls for when he asks “how can we become united and increasingly different?”
