Nasrin, when you ask about how micropolitical practices are necessary to a rearticulation of the political, quoting Guattari’s statement that links the micropolitical to the pragmatic, I think that what you  are getting at is perhaps that we must start from  the middle. It’s not enough, as you point out with the example of the military – to “reside” in a micropolitical
territory (if there were such a thing). We must generate vocabularies
across. This is what Stengers means, I think, when she talks about the necessity to create concepts that take off from  a singular political event. She explains: “To paraphrase Deleuze paraphrasing Artaud, I try to think
‘before’ the uncountable victims of this mania of oppositions [such as the
macro and micro], to create concepts that include protections, modes of deception that do not cease to return and that don’t pay attention to warnings.” For Stengers, the danger of the macro/micro opposition is its potential to regulate the passage between their inherent tendencies to reterritorialize. Despite Stengers’ unease around the concept of the micropolitical, I think she would agree that no matter what we call it, we must become sensitive to the modes of crossing that activate and emphasize certain political tendencies and in turn  mobilize certain
specific responses. Important is to become aware of how these
transversal passages occur and where they might lead to. Stengers speaks of this in terms of 2 (his)stories [histoires]: “we are in suspense between two (his)stories.” The first history involves a mode of capture that insists on continuous evolution while it distributes both the possible and the impossible. We might call it capitalism. The second history is that of an intrusion or a counter­capture. It cannot be anticipated nor prepared for; it cannot be desired in advance. It must be created.
