To come back to your  question, then, I think we create the conditions for ethico­aesthetic practices at the micropolitical level through a close attention to techniques. As we’ve seen in our work at the SenseLab, this requires flexibility and the ability to allow a project to fail. Each project creates its own conditions for experimentation and proposes its own techniques. But without attentive development of the potential of these openings, a project can easily fall flat.  That’s  why  we spend so much time in the preparation of each event. Each event is its own fine balance between choreography and improvisation. What we seek to do – as we’ve done for our recent event, Society of Molecules – is to facilitate crossings and openings by creating limits on how the event can come to expression. In the case of Society of Molecules, these constraints were meant to enable certain precise ways of creating affective tonalities between and across different local constituencies, giving rise to specific techniques mobilized at the local level.
