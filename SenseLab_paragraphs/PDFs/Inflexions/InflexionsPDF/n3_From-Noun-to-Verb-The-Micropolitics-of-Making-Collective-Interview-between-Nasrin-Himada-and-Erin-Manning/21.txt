something quite interesting: that how the micropolitical has been mobilized within the particular Franco­Belgian academic/political scene
in which Bruno Latour and Isabelle Stengers circulate may have undone it of its potential. The micropolitical as the thought of the milieu has been reinscribed into the value­based micro/macro dichotomy. From the thought of the middle, the micropolitical has become the edge of a spectrum that demonizes the complex interweaving of different political regimes. It has lost its capacity to move across and through.
