In the context of Australian Aboriginal culture, the convergences of singular effects regularly move transversally between the micro and the macropolitical. As Glowczewski points out in her discussion of the “death in custody” issue, when Aboriginal research groups came together to propose recommendations for macropolitical dissemination, their way of working together was micropolitically motivated. She explains: “it was absolutely incredible working in an environment of Aboriginal people of different generations with different experiences […] and watching them

the end the process didn’t restrict itself solely to the theme of death and custody: they were rebuilding everything, education, health, justice system, police, housing, environmental issues. And they proposed this incredible sort of weaving, throughout the continent, of more than 360 recommendations, which were given to the parliament and voted by the parliament and out of 360 recommendations maybe only 30 were applied ten years later.” What stands out here is that in order to address
one particular law, a mode of collaboration had to be put into place. This mode of collaboration had to be sensitive to different modalities of thinking and speaking, writing and disseminating information, crossing as it did a population with different oral and written skills – including many elders who never learned to read and write but whose views on the

It became the cultivation of a process that opened itself up to the wider effects of the “death in custody” issue. Creating a kind of collective subjectivity, the discussions became focused on the wide web of convergences this particular law could bring into focus. Their
