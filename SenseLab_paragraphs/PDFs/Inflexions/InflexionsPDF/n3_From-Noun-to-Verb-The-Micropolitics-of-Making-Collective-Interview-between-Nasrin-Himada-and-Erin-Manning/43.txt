I often ask myself how I can make these lines visible, depending on the context, asking how can these processes be connected—not superficially but rigorously as a way to think through the ways in which these practices (of occupation) have an effect elsewhere. Language is important here, as you  mentioned, to create a vocabulary that expresses the complexity of what we’re dealing with, and
communication is important, in terms of how we can make these thoughts
graspable—Malcolm X is very inspiring in this regard.
