In its place a new concept is born – the meso – which Stengers defines as “the locus of invention where the pragmatics of the question are far more alive, lively, more difficult to forget than the micro or the macro, between which the game of truth is always at stake.” Perhaps what we can learn from  this conceptual drift can be linked to how we might think perception in the artworld. Concepts must redeploy themselves, making themselves felt, activating present conjunctions. While the micropolitical for me does express potential in and for the milieu, for Stengers and Latour, it is the meso which is creative of difference and potential. It is the meso which affirms its co­presence with/in a milieu. And it is the meso which is most pragmatically material. As Stengers says, “All material is in relation to a milieu.”
