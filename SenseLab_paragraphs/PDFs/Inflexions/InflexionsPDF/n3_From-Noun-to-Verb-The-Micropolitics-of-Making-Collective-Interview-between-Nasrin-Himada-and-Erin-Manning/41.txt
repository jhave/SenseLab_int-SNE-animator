NH: There are a lot of local activist groups here in Montreal (if that’s what you  mean by locally) that do a lot of important and necessary work. Tadamon! is one example of this. A collective concerned with issues in the Middle­East and right now focusing on issues concerning Palestine and Lebanon mostly, and also involved in the BDS movement (boycott, divestment and sanctions), which is another very influential and important movement that has emerged as a response to resisting complicity with
the Israeli occupation on an international level. Tadamon! has also been advocating for the Bil’in case here in Montreal. Bil’in is a village in the occupied West Bank that has been, for the last four years, organizing protests against the building of the wall across its lands. Also, the people
of the town of Bil’in are suing two Quebecois companies that are involved in the building of settlements and other types of residential buildings on Palestinian land. Under the Geneva international convention it is deemed illegal to build on occupied land, and so for the first time we see a push toward holding foreign companies responsible for how they’re also aiding in the occupation. For me, the BDS movement and the Bil’in case trials are two important examples of how to think the local and the global
together. What is important is not to think these separately – the local and global – but to know how to cut across them, which in these two
examples we see taking place.
