NH: I think changing the concept from  a noun to a verb, from  collective
to,  as you suggest, making collective—opens up potential for new ways to think and do collaboratively.  To think the concept of the collective—a coming­together of bodies that initiate a process of collaboration, participation, extension, and sharing—is to think and practice a politics of collective assemblages. This provokes a new ethics of practice that is not based on the idea of the common, but on the idea of technicity, and raises the question of the relation between theory and practice. How  is it that from  practice and experimentation concepts emerge? How  do we create the conditions for this relation to take place?
