Lawfare operated here at many different levels. First, the Israeli military was concerned with how to legalize large­scale destruction so that they could conduct highly destructive military operations ”lawfully”—thus legalizing what would otherwise be illegal in the language of IHL, and avoiding accusations of war crimes.  For example, “humanitarian munitions” was a term often used to describe the function of highly advanced military weaponry that they claimed had a smaller kill­ratio— minor “collateral” damage.  What is important to think about here is how language is being used and by whom. How  few are few—and—does not every life count?
