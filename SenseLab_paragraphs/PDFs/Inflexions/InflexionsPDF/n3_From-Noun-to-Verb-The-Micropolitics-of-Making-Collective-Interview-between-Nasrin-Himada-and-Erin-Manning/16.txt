Micropolitics, it seems to me, functions on a similar spectrum, activating the affective potential of the interval between feeling and doing. For some, this may make it sound like a “soft”  politics, but it’s quite the opposite. What is usually constituted as the real  thing – Politics with a capital P – is far less rigorously inventive, precisely because it operates in the sphere of representation where pre­composed bodies are already circulating. The micropolitical is that which subverts this tendency in the political to present itself as already fully formed. All politics is infested with micropolitical tendencies. This is what makes the political an event. In my opinion, much of political theory continues to invest too heavily in the already­articulated “capital P” Politics. The reason for this is simple: it is extremely challenging to speak of what has not yet fully taken form. Like the microperception that tweaks the event of perception, the micropolitical is the force of the political event that potentially unmoors it.
