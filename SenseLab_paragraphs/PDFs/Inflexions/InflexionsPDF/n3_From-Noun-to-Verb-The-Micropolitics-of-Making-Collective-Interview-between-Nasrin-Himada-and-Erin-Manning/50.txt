Gaza became the object of an experiment in lawfare, not only in regards to weapon testing (such as white phosphorous and DIME we saw in the many images disseminated) but also specifically in direct relation with the regulations of IHL. This is important to think about because not only do we see how language plays an important role  in how it’s utilized to evoke “humanitarian” violence, but we also see how the military is working strategically to change regulations and laws, and work them from  within their limit. What the military does here is work micropolitically at a macropolitical level, seeing how far the limit can be pushed. This doesn’t just have consequences for Palestinians.
