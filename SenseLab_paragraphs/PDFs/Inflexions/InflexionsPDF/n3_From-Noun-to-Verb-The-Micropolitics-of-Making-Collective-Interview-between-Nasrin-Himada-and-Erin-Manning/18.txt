Again, what seems important is to remember that the micropolitical is not in itself a modality for “positive” change. Micropolitics is not situated squarely on the political spectrum in terms of “right” or “left.” It moves across, transversally. Brian Massumi and Maurizio Lazzarato both make this very clear. Speaking about the Bush regime in the United States, Massumi emphasizes the politics of threat that coursed through the population during Bush’s 8­year tenure. Politics that operate through their  effects are micropolitical: they “work  on many levels and at many rhythms of bodily priming to ensure a relative success.” Such techniques are seen everywhere in the American war machine, and although they are less mobilized in the Obama administration, there certainly remains a reservoir of micropolitical potential from  Bush’s tenure. This potential remains open to reclaiming by the “right” and the “left”  – reclaiming has always been a part of the active passage between the micro and macro on the political spectrum – but this excess of micropolitical potential might just as well open onto new forms  of collective community organizing as mobilizing itself in affective politics of fear. We saw the potential mobility of the affective within the micropolitical in the Obama electoral race: Obama deployed many of the affective strategies we had seen during the Bush regime, but instead of tweaking them toward fear, he tweaked them toward hope.
