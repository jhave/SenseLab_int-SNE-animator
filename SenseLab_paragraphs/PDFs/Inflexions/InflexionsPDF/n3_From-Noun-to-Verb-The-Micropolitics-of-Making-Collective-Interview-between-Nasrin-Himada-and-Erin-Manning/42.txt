EM: I think the point you are making here about the local is very important. In the same way that itâ€™s false to consider the micropolitical as the smaller version of the political, it is equally important, I think, to allow the local to proliferate. Within the vocabulary of the micropolitical, the local is the milieu. It is the force of the event around which wider concerns converge. In this regard, the local is both absolutely singular and infinitely expansive or serial.  Singular in the sense of happening here and now
under these specific set  of conditions. Expansive in the sense that its
effects can be felt in other subsequent and simultaneous localities. How do you activate this complexity of the local in your  work?
