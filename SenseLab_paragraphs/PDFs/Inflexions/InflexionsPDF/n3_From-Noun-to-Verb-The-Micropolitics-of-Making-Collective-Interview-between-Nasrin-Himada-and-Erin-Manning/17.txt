Gina Badger’s project The Little Dig is a nice example of how micropolitics works microperceptually. The Little Dig, as you  know, is a temporary non­ monetary economy based on the exchange of dirt. Between May 11­16
2009, Badger deployed The Little Dig in Boston's financial district: she put a pile of dirt on the grass in front  of the Federal Reserve Bank  of Boston, proposing a new kind of exchange and creation of value. At the surface, the project is already compelling, and certainly, in many regards micropolitical: it addresses consumerism, for instance, in a generative
way, proposing a different model of value. But, as she points out, what really  make up the project are the techniques that underlie its political potential. These techniques pre­date the dissemination of the project and include a long and bureaucratic process that involved specialists at the MIT Insurance Office; the Environment, Health, and Safety Office; her MIT program’s administrative staff; the programming coordinator at the Rose Kennedy Greenway, her collaborators; her housemates; friends; and people from  craigslist who provided and then took away the dirt. This collaborative network was held together, it seems to me, by a micropolitical proposition that made a political promise that could only
be felt in its effects. Her project was not a metaphor for money, it was a
material way of feeling and doing the exchange, where the exchange happened just as intensely at the level of the project itself (on the grass in front  of the Federal Reserve Bank) as it did in the complex mobilized networks of bureaucracy, friendship, etc. The project is the techniques deployed for bringing to thought the various levels of engagement key  to developing a micropolitical process. This micropolitical process, as it develops into an artwork, brings perception to the fore, making felt the complex inadequacies and paradoxes of our current modes of exchange.
