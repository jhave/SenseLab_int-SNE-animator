So, how can we create a vocabulary that can speak to the complex relations between these vast landscapes of difference? How do we get at the problem of in­articulation to what is in actuality ungraspable?  I think we have a lot to learn from  fiction and poetry. And Foucault has a beautiful quote that I keep going back to when confronting this problem
in my own writing. Foucault, speaking of Blanchot’s work,  writes,  “Fiction
consists not in showing the invisible, but in showing the extent to which the invisibility of the visible is invisible.”
