In fact, the actualisation of a virtuality always happens in parallel with  the intervention of particular codes, or systems of capture, enclosing the unlimited openness of potential into the space of possibilistic limits: even the most visceral  bodily  feeling is nevertheless subject to a coded  biological apparatus of molecules, tissues,  organs, without which  it could  never  appear. As a result,  or rather as a side-effect  of this parallel actualisation/realisation, quantities, qualities and  codes spread everywhere in matter, opening up the irremediable forking between material divisibility (for example movement as a succession of units  and the metric  measurement of its velocity),  flow (the continuity of movement and  speed as its qualitative change)  and code (as an
