[6] In Difference and Repetition, Deleuze defines the limit/relation between the immutability of the virtual and  that which  is cancelled and, in cancelling, changes, as “a genuine cut [coupure]” (Deleuze, 2001: 172). The Deleuzian concept of the ‘cut’ has been replaced here by that of ‘cuttability’, in order to emphasise its ontological nature, and its difference from the actualisation of the digital cut, with which  it will be put in combination.
