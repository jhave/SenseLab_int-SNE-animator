Antonin De Bemels’ Trilogie Stroboscopique (2003 – 2005) is a digital video- choreographic triptych that explores the moving and dancing body through the stroboscopic effect, which  consists  of a fragmentation and  alternation of video  sequences frame by frame. In a fascinating series of image-sound combinations, the three  videos  appear as the products of a simple  but careful technical composition that endows them  with extreme precision and captivating sensuality in equal  measure. Technically re-choreographed through digital editing and  effects, the dancing body  opens  the way to the emergence of sensations, feelings,  thoughts.
