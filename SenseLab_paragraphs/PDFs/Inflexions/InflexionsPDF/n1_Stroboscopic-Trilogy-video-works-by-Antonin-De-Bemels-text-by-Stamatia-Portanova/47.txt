The habitual synthesis of the present and its corresponding qualitative sensation (a video-present, a wall-present) constitute the ‘foundation’ of time, the common soil occupied by stones  and  human beings,  by the walls of a church and  the digital figure  inhabiting its surface.  However, while  this foundation is constantly (even if imperceptibly, as in the case of a wall) moving and  constitutes a passing present, what  causes the present to pass is what  Deleuze defines  as ‘the ground of time’, memory, or the pure  being of the past which  allows  memory to take place as a representation of the former present which  the past was, as an extra dimension of the present itself (Deleuze, 2001: 79-85). Memory, in other  words, conjugates two representations as two coexisting dimensions of the present: the past as a past present, and the present in relation to which  it is past. It is in this sense that the old walls of the church can appear as ‘textured’ and  ‘inhabited’ by time and memories, evoking the character of Lilith, a woman that “has been banned from the church but (maybe)  still haunts its walls,...”  not only as a
past recollection but as a present reflection, a remembrance and a recognition,
the representational object of memory and  understanding at the same time.
