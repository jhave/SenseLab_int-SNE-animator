This is not a review of the videos  but a conceptual accompaniment to them. Each of the following interchangeable paragraphs focuses on one particular theme  and  then transduces it into a concept, to obtain  a series of ‘nodal thoughts’ departing but also deviating, converging and digressing from the actual  works. More than  descriptive, the aim is to draw a nexus of ideas (or rather, different variations of the same idea), whose  unity  of sense derives from the general compositional logic of what  I would like to define  as the
‘intuitive mathematics’ of the cut. The actualisation of these ideas  consists  in imagining, rather than  illustrating or explaining things;  accordingly, the conceptual abstractions presented here never totally  explain or coincide  but rejoice in their exceeding and in their being simultaneously exceeded by the autonomous unfolding of the moving images.
