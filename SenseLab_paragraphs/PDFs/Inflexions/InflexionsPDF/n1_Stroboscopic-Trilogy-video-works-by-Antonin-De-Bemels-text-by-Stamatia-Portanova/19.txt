‘quantitability’, a potential for being quantified: a continuous graduation representing the quasi-cause for the generation of actual  quantities (Deleuze,
2001: 175). Without corresponding to a definite quantity, the differential of the idea constitutes a pre-condition for the production of quantification and for
the generation of discontinuous series. Neither a fixed nor a variable quantity, quantitability refers to a susceptibility for limits or cuts, an opening towards the cut, or the calling forth of the cut, a ‘cuttability’ towards its actualisation. As a border between what  is changeable and what  is unchangeable, what  is determinable and what  is not to be determined in the virtuality of ideas, quantitability or ‘cuttability’ operates a selection  on the level of intensive differences, between what  undergoes actualisation (quantification and qualification) and what  will ‘statically’ remain virtual. In other  words, in
order to actualise themselves, ideas (‘cuttabilities’ as the ideal causes  of
continuity, ‘virtual  cuts’ as the special  effects of reality),  need  a concrete  cut. [6]
