The subtle  quantification and  measurement of movement operated by the software allows  the creation of sequences endowed with  incredibly fast or slow velocities,  as if every increase in the number of micro-fragments could produce a maximum of speed. It can always be argued that velocity  is not speed, and  that the digital re-construction of a movement does not have to do with  the virtuality implicit in the live experience of that same movement. The multiple possible combinations offered  by the digital appear hopelessly distant from the potentiality of the virtual as a transcendental and open condition of experience. In fact, as a condition (rather than  an occasion)  of experience, the virtual is never  directly experienced, presented or re- presented as such by any specific inorganic, living or human body.  It can only push, as a “focus or horizon within perception”, a tendency pressing for its own actualisation or an energetic field of non-actualised tendencies towards taking-form (Deleuze, 2001: 169). By defining the virtual as the field where effects (the tendencies of a process of taking-form) become  independent from causes,  Steven Shaviro  relates  it to “sonorous, optical,  or linguistic ‘effects’, or what  in the movies  are called ’special effects’”. [3] From this point  of view, it becomes  possible to ontologically define  an effect not as the passive, perceptible last phase  of a process, but as whatever actively  brings  forth a problematic and sets things in motion, in the perceptual as well as in the intellectual field: an idea in someone’s (or something’s) mind, attracting
