The ghostly in-efficacy of ideas induces us to think  that virtuality is nowhere, in the sense of its not existing  anywhere in its actualisations (no more  in the body  than  in technology), or rather that it is everywhere but without direct relation to the actual,  a potential lurking behind (or on the surface  of) every actual  entity,  organic or technological, no matter its way to code reality.  In fact, the paradox is that of a relational non-relation: in-between the idea as virtual quasi-cause and its actualisation as an experienced effect, an immanent relation is woven by the registering of an intensive difference, a difference of intensity carried by the idea and emerging like the precursor of an imminent actualisation. In the technological domain, what  is digitised has always already been actualised, and has therefore already distanced itself from the virtuality of the idea, by taking  a determinate form, even if only the microscopic shape  of a bit. But the frozen  possibilism of the digital only appears when  considering the technology from the point  of view of its linear causality, when  taking into account the pre-conditions (the on and  off
energetic states,  0s and  1s) and the algorithmic rules directing its working and
physically producing its effects. Differently from the linear causality of the digital as ‘pure code’, the quasi-causality of the virtual is constituted by the autonomous concatenation of effects, the objective ideas carrying with  them the potential to actualise and  at the same time to ‘constrain’ the process  of actualisation. Residing neither in the separate dimension of a metaphysical realm  nor in the embodied subjectivity of perception, the idea wavers, as a predictive memory of what  is to come, in an intensive, and therefore indivisible, interval, the instant in which  qualities prepare themselves to appear, on the limit of their imminent actualisation. How  are we to understand this indivisibility and imminence of ideas, in the light of digital technology and  its extreme logic of the cut? How  can we take into account the different lengths and  measures, the abrupt velocities,  implied by digitisation and  its infinitesimally determined scale?
