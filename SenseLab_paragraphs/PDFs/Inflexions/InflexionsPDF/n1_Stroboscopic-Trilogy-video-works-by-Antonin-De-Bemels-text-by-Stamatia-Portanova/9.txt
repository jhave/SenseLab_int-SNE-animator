De Bemels’ work is based  on a technique of ‘micro-fragmentation’ which identifies the digitally cut frames  with  the microscopic building blocks of a very simple  compositional logic of multiple alternations. Following this logic, the digital ‘cut’ aspires to become  the sign of a multitude of microscopic perceptions and  movements animating the rhythmical becomings of the dancing body,  that imperceptible multiplicity in need  of a sensible  (even if not clearly discernible) form of expression. For Gottfried Leibniz (and for many other  17th century thinkers), a myriad of ‘inconspicuous perceptions’
compose the consciousness of one single movement, but without individually
standing out enough for us to be aware of  them  (Deleuze, 2006: 97-113). The concept of inconspicuous  micro-movement cannot  be merely superimposed onto a digital fragment: the dissectability theorised by Leibniz is not of a binary but of a fractal nature. Differently from the endless fractal level of micro-perception, the video  editing software isolates  smaller and  smaller
parts  that reach the ultimate scale of the digital bit. And yet, the cut bits reveal
a peculiar potential, becoming the testimonies of a machinic propension, a tendency to reach the unreachable, the obscure depth, the ‘fuscum subnigrum’ of ‘infinitely  minute elements’ that fuzzily  connect  the whole world to each of our single perceptions and  movements. The con-fused and intricate molecular dynamics of the moving body  can thus  be suggestively perceived, vaguely thought (or conceptually imagined), through the freezing dissections effected by the digital composition.
