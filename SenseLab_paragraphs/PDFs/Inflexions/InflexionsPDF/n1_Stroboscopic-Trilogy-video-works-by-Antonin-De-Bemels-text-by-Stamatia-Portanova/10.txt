De Bemels’ digital compositional technique can be defined as a sort of microscopic cinematography, in the sense of its use of the software to analyse movement into its infinite  critical instants, and  then  to re-edit  it frame by frame.  Cinematographically speaking, to re-construct movement from small sections  (or frames)  is always more  than  a mere mechanical collage of frozen bits retroactively mimicking the continuity of what  was once alive. It is more like a de- and re-composition of singularities, a material filtering and interpretation of movement by the cinematographic machine. As a technical variation of the cinematographic phylum, digital cinema  perceives its object through an extremely subtle  mesh: a linear  succession of cuts, however small and  detailed, can never  reach the complexity of a manifold (an infinite multiplicity of folds rather than  particles), but its audiovisual effects can get very close to it. [1] The digital technique shows a capacity to affect perception and  thought, in a way which  is very similar  to that of the microscopic lens. Already in the 17th century, the use of the microscope introduced a new way to see things, thanks to its capacity to dis-assemble the atomic  consistency of matter. An imaginative, almost  ‘hallucinatory’ vision  could  unfold itself, constituting a visionary field where art and philosophy could  meet and  share a particular taste (a ‘way of treating things’) with  science. This particular way of treating, or seeing, the world microscopically, was like a sensitivity and imagination of the infinite  hidden behind the surface  of a finite perception:
