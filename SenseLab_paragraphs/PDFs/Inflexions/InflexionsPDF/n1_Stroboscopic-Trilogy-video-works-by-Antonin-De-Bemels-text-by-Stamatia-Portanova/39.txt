Lilith (2006, 7’30’’, performer Barbara  Mavro  Thalassitis), is a video  installation which  was initially created for the Brigittines Chapel, an old religious building transformed in a cultural center,  situated in downtown Brussels.  The video  loop is screened by night  above  the front door  of a chapel.  Another special  requirement for the installation of the piece is its screening in a hollow niche or alcove, in semi-darkness.
