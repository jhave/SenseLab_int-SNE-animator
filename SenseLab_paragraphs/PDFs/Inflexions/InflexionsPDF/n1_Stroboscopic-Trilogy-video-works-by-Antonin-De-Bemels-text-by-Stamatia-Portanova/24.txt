A whole  series of questions starts  to unravel itself here: how does the virtual- actual  encounter happen? How  can intensity be coded? Is it possible to conceive  a difference between ‘productive’ and  ‘nonproductive’, bodily  and technological limits (or codes)? Or maybe  it is only possible to talk about  a more  or less creative  way to use the limit? How  can a body  be limited, coded, cut, and  at the same time ‘retain’ virtuality? We understand that what  is critical in the technique or the code is its use to either  flatten  or accentuate differences: for example in the hyper-realistic aim of digital cinema,  special effects become  a way to homogenise the qualitative difference between
‘organic’ and ‘cinematic’ perception, while in the more ‘sensationalist’ aims of
the cinematographic industry, these effects paradoxically manage to bring forth a whole  range  of new kinetic  qualities. In this sense, the cut, or the actual  ‘limit’ of digital video becomes  a synthetic operator, an in-between marker to accentuate the difference, or the non-coincidence, between an
‘ordinary’ and a ‘singular’  perception of movement.
