At this point,  we should remember how an important compositional element enters  Bacon’s works,  as a fundamental complementary counterpart to his moving (or ‘moved’) painting, without which  no rhythmical becoming could take place or become  visible: that of the witness (Deleuze, 2002c: 135-138). Indicating more  a compositional constant than  the representation of a real observer, this parallel figure  which  is so present in most of the paintings fulfills, with  its immutable repeatability, the precise  structural role of keeping a constant temporality, beating an almost  flat time or cadence with respect to which  the variation of the other  figures  can be critically  valued and perceived. This particular technical feature refers to a decisive  aesthetical peculiarity
