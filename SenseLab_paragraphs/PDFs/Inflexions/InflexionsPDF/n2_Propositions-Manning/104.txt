Events  emerge from a process immanent to their emergence. When the events have fully taken  form, they will forever  remain what  they have become.  This arabesque will forever  have been this arabesque. Yet every future instance of an arabesque will be affected  by the continuum of the arabesque-as-nexus. The arabesque is both absolutely what  it is now and  an infinity of qualitative arabesque-contributions toward a dancing future. This means that while there is no continuity of becoming for the event  per se, there is continuity of becoming on the durational plane  of experience. The arabesque-as-nexus is not an event: it contributes the feeling of arabesque for the subsequent arabesque-event. Whitehead has two terms  for the durational or virtual becoming of continuity: nexus  and  extensive continuum. The nexus  is the plane  through which  the shadow of past events  contributes to present activations. [25] Choreographic propositions rely on the relational potential of this virtual stratum.
