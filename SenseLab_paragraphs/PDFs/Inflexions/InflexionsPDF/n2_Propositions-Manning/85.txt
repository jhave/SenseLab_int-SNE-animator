The walk’s unfolding as horizontality depends on finding within its quality of movement the doubleness of its point  of virtual departure and arrival. This two- directional betweenness is what  gives the movement its horizontalizing consistency. It is through the virtual interval of the walk’s preacceleration that walking is transformed from a step into a movement. [19]
