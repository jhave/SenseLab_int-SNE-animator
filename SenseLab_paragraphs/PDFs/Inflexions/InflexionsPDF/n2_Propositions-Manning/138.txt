[8] In Perception Attack (forthcoming MIT Press), Brian Massumi develops a theory of mentality (derived from Whitehead’s vocabulary of the mental and physical poles that make up every  actual  occasion)  that addresses the uncanny temporality of propositions in the way I am defining them  here. He writes:  “The mental pole is the share of the event  that is renewable, in the sense that it may reembody. It is the share of the event  that is reversible, in the sense that when it renews it will have returned to the beginning, through a terminus recurring, folding back-under to in-form  renascent tendency.”
