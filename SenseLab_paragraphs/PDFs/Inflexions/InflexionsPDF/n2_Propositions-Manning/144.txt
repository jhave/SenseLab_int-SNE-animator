the proposition constitutes what  the feeling has felt. The proposition constitutes a lure for a member of its locus by reason  of the germaneness of the complex predicate to the logical subjects,  having regard to forms of definiteness in the actual  world of that member, and to its antecedent phases of feeling”
(Whitehead, 1978: 186; my emphasis). Decision  is immanent to the process  of
concrescence in Whitehead. I use ‘cut’ throughout this paper rather than
‘decision’ to underline the way in which  decision operates not from outside the occasion  but participates in the difference of its unfolding. A decision is how the event  comes to completion. There is no event without decision, and no decision that can alter an already constituted event.
