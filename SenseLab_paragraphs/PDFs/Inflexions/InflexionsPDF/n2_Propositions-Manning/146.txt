[17] In the watching of dance,  there  is a similar  qualitative transformation of what  a (perceiving) body  can do.
[18] Deleuze refers to this as passive synthesis. See Difference and Repetition. [19] The process of moving through the metastability of verticalising and
horizontalising balances walking requires is very apparent in children learning
to walk. The first stage of walking tends towards a falling back: from sitting  to standing to sitting.  Verticality is tended toward as a limit that throws the movement back. In the second stage, a tottering occurs whereby momentum is gathered forward-falling. This translates into saccaded steps,  each step its own dynamic form. For walking to ensue,  the steps themselves must  become absorbed into the horizontal advance of the movement. This backgrounds the steps,  allowing the momentum of horizontality to take over.
