Take the walk. When we walk, each step is already virtually imbued with  all previous walkings, all previous proprioceptive tendings and kinesthetic sensings. This virtual plenitude of experience and experimentation assures a metastability of balance,  a sensual memory of how the ground touches the foot and  the weight shifts as the body  transfers from step to step. The memory of having-walked is not an activated memory per se: we are rarely  thinking about walking while we walk. It is a memory on the edge of perception, sustaining the movement within its infinite  range  of potential metastabilities. This is a passive memory [18] active in the folds of the nowness of perception, its time-signature specious. The passive memory of the metastabilities garnered from a lifetime  of walking can save us from a fall when  the snowy ground suddenly turns to ice or when we almost-trip over the edge of the sidewalk.
