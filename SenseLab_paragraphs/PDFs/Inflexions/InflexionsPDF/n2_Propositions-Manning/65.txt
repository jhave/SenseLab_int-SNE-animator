Nik Hafner describes a practice session  with Forsythe: Hafner is working on a jump  he feels isn’t working. He thinks he has the timing wrong. Forsythe suggests that it “isn’t the speed of the movement itself, but its stopping, the arrival, the reaching of the new position” that is at stake (Hafner, 2004: 138). Still, the movement continues to be missing something. Bill tries a different tact, explaining that “the end of the movement is not a real stopping”, suggesting to Hafner that to execute  the movement successfully, he should continue “to think the movement after the so-called Stop, that I should let the movement slowly endlessly grow” (2004: 138).
