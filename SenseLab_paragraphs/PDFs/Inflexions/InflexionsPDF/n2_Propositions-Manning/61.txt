A technique used  by the Forsythe ballet to bring  into expression the transduction of processes for making time in dance  takes the form of what  Hafner calls the “step-maker”. Step-makers take part in many  of Forsythe’s choreographies. Their role is to initiate or comment on “the changing velocity  and dynamics of the piece” (Hafner, 2004: 137). Choreographic tempo is gauged by the step-maker’s movement such that the piece itself becomes  imbued with  their rhythms,
affecting  the felt duration of movement-time for the rest of the dancers. Step- maker:  dancing proposition for the transduction from measure to duration, from time-counting to time-texturing.
