I am inclined to believe that because we are bodies  and possess  perceptive mechanisms we also have time. I suspect our ability  to construct time is predicated on the manner in which  the body  integrates its perceptions and upon the action necessary to generate these perceptions. The characteristic I would most associate with bodily  time is the unsustainable. Nothing in the body  can be sustained indefinitely. [Interview, 2008]
