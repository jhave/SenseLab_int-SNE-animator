This is not the case. Whitehead’s concept  of the proposition does not find its voice in an already-conceived language. “Spoken language,” Whitehead warns, “is merely a series of squeaks” (Whitehead, 1978: 264). Language by itself means little. “The vagueness of verbal  statement is such that the same form of words is taken  to represent a whole  set of allied  propositions of various grades of abstractness” (1978: 193). When language moves  us, it is because it operates in relation, becoming-propositional. A proposition can unfold in language, but not as an additive to an already-stable matrix  of denotation. Propositions alter the ground of active relations between language, affect and gesture (to name  a few), intensifying, attenuating, inhibiting, transmuting not meaning as such, but the affective  force of the time-slip of experience.
