unexpected ways.”  [30] The algorithms Forsythe creates  generate an ontogenetic field. This ontogenetic field seeds  the conditions for ecologies  of experience. For Forsythe, these ecologies  are often populated by dancing bodies.  But in the case
of his choreographic objects, he may focus instead on an ecology of matter. Either
way, the ecological  field organizes bodies.  [31] This mode  of organization is not a situating of bodies  in stable spacetime. It is an activity  that creates  the conditions for the creation of spacetimes of encounter between bodies  and  ground, between air and  sound, between light and movement. This constant recombination of matter-form calls forth certain  iterations which  are in tune  with  the randomized effects of the algorithms. Here,  the proposition of the algorithm is immanent to
its unfolding in spacetimes of experience: its algorithmic uncertainty occasions
the appearance of qualities of relation never  before ascertained.
More recently, Forsythe has extended this process to participatory installations. Like the algorithms before them,  these choreographic objects are propositions for the generating of qualities of relation: they are propositions for relational movement. [32] Relational because “pieces  can be developed from any point,  and any point  within a piece comprises the fullness of the whole” (Casperson, 2004:
108). Relational movement because they create ecologies  of encounter. Propositional because they “constitute a source  for the origination of feeling which  is not tied down to mere datum” (Whitehead, 1978: 186). Propositional because they co-constitute actual  occasions,  always immanent to their unfolding as events.
