Forsythe sings the rhythm of movement taking form, making experiential the folds of what  cannot  be perceived as such. These folds of micromovements are virtual contributions on the verge  of actual  movement. No actual  taking-form of movement could  occur without an infinity of micromovements active in the preacceleration and  the deployment of a singular movement’s form-taking. Micromovements are akin to the unsustainable in time – impossible to grasp and maintain – yet absolutely key to how movement resolves itself as a taking-form. When he sings movement, what  Forsythe is sounding is not a body dancing a particular movement, but the speed of lived folding. Folding-through is what moves  the sounding.
