[10] Whitehead writes:  “The problem which  the concrescence [the taking-form] solves is, how the many  components of the objective  content are to be unified in one felt content with its complex subjective form. This one felt content is the
'satisfaction,' whereby the actual  entity  is its particular individual self; to use
Descartes' phrase, 'requiring nothing but itself in order to exist.'” (Whitehead,
1978: 233).
