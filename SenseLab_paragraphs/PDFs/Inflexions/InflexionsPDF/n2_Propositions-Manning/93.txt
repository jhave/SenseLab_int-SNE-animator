Because each rhythm is itself a duration, rhythm is what  gives time to incipient movement, characterizing that singular movement’s in-timeness. This in- timeness is not a beat [21] or a measure but a quality of becoming that is co- terminous with  the incipiency of the movement’s preacclereation and the elasticity of its unfolding. Rhythm cuts across measure. It is akin to Forsythe’s sounding movement. It makes  felt the microperceptual.
