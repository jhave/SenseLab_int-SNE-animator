Go back to the curve.  Say you’re dancing it. You are now on stage, performing Eidos:Telos. You move  the movement as it comes, drawn in by choreographic principles, folding through propositions. Suddenly the movement curves  you. You experience a strange déjà-vu. But it’s not a déjà-vu – it’s a déjà-felt.  This déjà-felt is not a returning to the past. It is a re-experiencing in the present. You can’t quite  put your  finger on what  you’re  feeling, or even where you’ve  felt it before. But you know  you’re dancing the dance  – the movement is moving you
with  the resonance of having-been danced, as though this movement had  passed through you before. This déjà-felt is an experience of the uncanniness of the doubling of experiential time where time is actively  in the now of the before and the will have become  of the same now. You are not dancing in the past.  You are dancing the past’s feeling doubling with  the present feeling. You are dancing two spacetimes at once, moving the between. This is the time of the event,  neither
here nor there: dancing the interval.
