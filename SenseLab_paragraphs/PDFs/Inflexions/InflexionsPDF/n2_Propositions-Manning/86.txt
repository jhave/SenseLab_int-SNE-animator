After we have followed the lines of divergence beyond the turn, these lines must  intersect again,  not at the point  from which  we started, but rather at a virtual point,  at a virtual image  of the point  of departure, which  is itself located  beyond the turn  in experience; and which  finally gives us the sufficient reason  of the thing,  the sufficient reason  of the composite, the sufficient reason  of the point  of departure (Deleuze, 1988: 28-29).
