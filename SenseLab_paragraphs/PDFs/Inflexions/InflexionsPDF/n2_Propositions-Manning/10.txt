Choreography is not dance.  It is a mistake to assign  choreography to a specific human body.  Bodies do not conform:  they always exceed their composition.
‘Choreography and dancing are two distinct and  very different practices’ (Forsythe, 2008: 5). Choreography sets the stage for an ecology of movement events.  It delimits the infinity of movement, subtracting from the realm of opportunity to create a singular vocabulary for change.
