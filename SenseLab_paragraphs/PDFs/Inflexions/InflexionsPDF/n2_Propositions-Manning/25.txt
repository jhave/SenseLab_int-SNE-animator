This experience is specious: it takes us into the time-slip of the event.  This speciousness has a quality of fabulation: it enervates us toward the paradox of time and incites us to invent with  time. [7] Choreographic objects draw us into this speciousness by infiltrating our experience with  the verge  of this doubling. If these were  merely  stable objects inhabiting already-constituted space, they wouldn’t have such a hold on us. We would walk right by them.  They would exist in a predictable time. As it is, they exist in the between of a proposition and its eventness, inciting  the participant to invent through them,  to move  with  the experimentation of the propositon’s unfolding into the time of movement.
