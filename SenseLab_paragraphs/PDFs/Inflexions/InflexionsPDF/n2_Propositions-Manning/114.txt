Forsytheâ€™s language machines are more  than  language. They are propositional algorithms. Algorithms are iterative equations that can evolve  through the randomness of their difference in repetition. In computer systems, drift is often expressed through built in randomness in the algorithm that,  over time, causes  a tweaking of the primary conditions. These are known in mathematics as probabilistic algorithms. Key is that randomization is part  of their logic.
