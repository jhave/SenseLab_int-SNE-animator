As a movement realizes  itself, it stops  becoming. It perishes along  the nexus  of thought-feelings. In Whitehead’s terms,  it has achieved its satisfaction. There can be no continuity of becoming when an event has taken  form. But there can and will be more becoming of continuity: another movement is already folding- through. You will never  move  through épaulement in quite  the same way.
