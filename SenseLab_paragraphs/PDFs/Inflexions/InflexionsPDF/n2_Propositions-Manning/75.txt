When  we move beyond our own experience, when we sound out the in-between, we are treading into the unsustainable arena  of microperception. We can get lost here. If we do, no singularity of movement will result.  The singularity of movement resides not in the actualization of a movement’s micromovements as such but in the manner in which  micromovements contribute to the movement’s taking  form. The decisive  turn  through which  a constellation of micromovements congeal  into a singularity might  come when  the line elbow-shoulder takes on velocity  and we feel a newness of experience through the contrast of habit  and difference. When our body  is no longer  a containor for movement but a force for the transduction of movement. To experiment with  this beyond of experience where movement singularities are emergent is to invent-with a becoming-body. “When we have benefited in experience from a gleam which  shows  us a line of articulation, all that remains is to extend it beyond experience” (Deleuze, 1988:
27; translation modified). The decisive turn  of the extension beyond experience is the point  of inflexion  where line becomes  curve  and  proposition becomes movement.
