Rhythmically, movement evolves  in ecological  concert  with the becoming- environment. Rhythm signs duration, lending duration its time-signature. Bergson  insists: duration has rhythm. [22] This virtual rhythm affects how the event’s time-signature is modulated in its unfolding. The time-signature of a jump  is vastly  different from the time-signature of a float. The jump’s time- signature or rhythm is felt on the verge  of experience in the feeling of an inclination whereas the rhythm of a float is experienced in a buoyancy verging on sinking. The feeling for duration experienced through these different time- signatures is the rhythm of their mattering. Rhythm plays  on this verging of experience that gives quality to matter. It adds a quality to experience’s taking form. Rhythm textures a becoming-form, bringing a singular quality to its individuation. Rhythm makes  felt the singularity of lived  experience.
Choreographic practice in an open  ecology of biogrammatic endurance is rhythm in motion.
