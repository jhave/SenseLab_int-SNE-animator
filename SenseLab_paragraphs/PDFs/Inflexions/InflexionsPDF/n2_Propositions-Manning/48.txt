When the event  takes form, the signature of an actualizing event-time emerges that sets time-as-now in motion. This time-signature [9] situates the event  in a specious present. The difference between time in everyday life-events and  time as activated through choreographic objects is simply the quality of making felt the time of the occasion for the taking time of experiencing the now. Amidst the time collisions  of everyday, the taking-time for the now is often backgrounded. By foregrounding the singular time of the event,  choreographic objects make time for experimentation.
