What is unsustainable is the experience of time in-itself.  To manage this unsustainability, we tend  to approach event-time as though it could  be parceled out in manageable quantities of distinct presents, pasts  or futures. But despite our best efforts, event-time remains unsustainable. Event-time is a miring in the multiplicity of now â€“  the now  that has passed, the now that is passing and the now that will have been, each phase  of nowness contributing to the occasion  at
hand. To be in-time  is to experience the uncanniness of being with  the past in the future toward the present. Time as duration is unmeasurable, unknowable as such, unsustainable in experience.
