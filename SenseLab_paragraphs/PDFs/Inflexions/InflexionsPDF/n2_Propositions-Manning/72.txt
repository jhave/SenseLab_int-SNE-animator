Movement-time is the event  cluster  of a gathering into experience of the time-slip of measurable time and  the durational experience of micromoving. Each movement is a line of flight caught in the between of imperceptible micromovements and  actual  movement taking form. How  a movement develops depends on the how of its micromovementsâ€™ ingressions into the taking form of the time of the event.  Micromovements make all the difference. Take a line:
elbow-shoulder. This line could  be drawn as a vector,  or could  be a curve inflected toward an inclination. Experimenting with it is to discover not only different opportunities for lines and curves  and  angles,  but to sense the almost- perceptible microperceptions of difference in kind.
