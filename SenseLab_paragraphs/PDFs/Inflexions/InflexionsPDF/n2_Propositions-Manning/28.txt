Every conception of the new is the actualisation of a contrast. For Whitehead, contrast is a conduit to creativity. What the proposition calls for is not a newness as something never  before invented, but a set of conditions that tweak experience in the making. Propositions are lures. They are a form of potential that alters  the experiential vectorization of an actual  occasion.  A proposition is not something added to an occasion.  It is how an occasion  for experience holds  within its potential the dynamics of singularity. This singularity is what  Whitehead calls “a lure for feeling.”  Propositions that incite creativity lure difference into the pact of their unfolding through the tweaking of the occasion.  This tweaking brings  about the resolution of potentiality and actuality while leaving a trace of the virtual nonetheless. This is the subtraction in the addition, the more-than less-than of experience.
