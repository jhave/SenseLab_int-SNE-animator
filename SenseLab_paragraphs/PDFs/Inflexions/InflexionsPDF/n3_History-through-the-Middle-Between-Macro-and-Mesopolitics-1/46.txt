For us as well.” Apparently, with you things are going better, and we would do well to learn more about your techniques, about your  modes of assemblage, about what you have learned. As for GECo, I believe that it is at the moment below the mesopolitical threshold
that would allow it to envision intervening. It is more that it exists in the interstices
of an academic milieu undergoing a very brutal operation of redefinition. We’re very late in this regard, but we’re catching up with great speed, in terms of putting into place organizational forms corresponding to the injunction to position oneself in the academic market at large, with experts in evaluation at every level, and with an imperative of evaluability. And the resistance within the academic milieu is quasi nonexistent, even in France where, barring the unforeseen, the current movement of resistance lacks the transversal power to
