IS: So, now we come to the two histories, which Au temps des catastrophes opens with, and where I write: “we are in suspense between two histories.” The first history we’re familiar with, it’s the one that takes growth both for its slogan and as its operator, which is an operator of capture that at the same time makes things hold together and distributes the possible and the impossible. In our
worlds, nothing is possible without growth. Today’s economic and financial crisis belongs to this history, and as long as we talk about crisis we remain caught within its coordinates. Recovery is then the horizon of thought. This means, of course, that this is the history of worlds under the grip of capitalism. The other history is basically of an intrusion. We all know that something is in the process of intruding into our  history that was neither anticipated nor prepared for, that was wished for by no one, including of course those who have been struggling against capitalism’s hold. No one is ready for what’s coming. It is beyond all of us, it’s important to emphasize that. The chances are that this second history will be one that can be purely and simply associated with open barbarism, and those chances are all the greater to the extent that the first history makes out as if this were only a “crisis” to be surmounted. It is faced  with this hypothesis of barbarism that I try to think and use the term intrusion, referring the new question of temporality which requires a break with the messianic­revolutionary tone. This is a break with the grand humanist perspective, in which time works for those who are on the side of truth. And incidentally, it is a break with those who function in the mode of “I know, but nevertheless …” ­­ which is the degree­zero of idealism, in whose eyes any pragmatism is a synonym for betrayal. The intrusion of what I call Gaia is a radically materialist event.
