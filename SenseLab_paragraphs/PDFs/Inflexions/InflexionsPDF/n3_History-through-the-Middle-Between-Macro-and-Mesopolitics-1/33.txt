An example: There is a great danger that the barbarism will take the form  of a governance by experts charged with managing scarcity in the name of emergency. No joy in this situation, where it will be decreed what one has the right to do, what one does not have the right to do, based on a rationality that is arithmetically incontestable, but lethal. It will be incontestable only in the sense that it is arithmetic. In this regard as well, Starhawk made me think more effectively than a thousand academic texts. I don’t know if you’ve read her novel, The Fifth Sacred Thing, published in 1993. It’s a futuristic novel that takes place forty years from  now … things have indeed taken a turn  for the worse, except in San  Francisco (because there has to be a place where things happen differently, otherwise there’d be no novel), where there was a critical mass allowing for a reinvention of the city.  But on the West Coast, it’s barbarism, the reign of the water barons and their mercenaries, and the water barons are the direct descendents of the expert agencies that decided who would have the right to how much water, and that took into their own hands the life and death of others.  Don’t say witches are regressive, seeking to reanimate a spirituality condemned by history.  I think that their practices make them capable of connecting with what is unique in our epoch, including the threat of new types
of powers for which we lack a concept and have never experienced. Call  into question, instead, the absence of relay among thinkers who just speculate on becomings and other existential catalyses. They are a far cry from  William James, who knew how to compromise and expose himself.
