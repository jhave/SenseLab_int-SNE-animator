IS: I take the virtual in Etienne Souriau’s sense, for whom it is not a chimera, not an empty dream or unrealizable utopia, but that which demands instauration. That
is one of the meanings of the virtual in Deleuze. Deleuze’s virtual has Bergsonian dimensions, but it also has Souriau dimensions, even though Deleuze never cited him except in What is Philosophy? This is the virtual as “the work  to be done” (l’oeuvre à faire), as calling for realization. For example, it isn’t the artist’s  idea. It’s what the artist  is not the author of, but which he or she puts to work. Whitehead also held the thesis that ideas do not belong to us. In Adventures of Ideas he writes that in The Banquet Plato invented “man” as “sensitive to the idea.” Man does not have ideas, he is sensitive to them. Whitehead added that Plato should have another dialogue after The Banquet called The Furies. The Furies is what results from  an imperfect reception of the idea, what happens
when the idea becomes proper to the human, when it becomes our property, or to put it another way, when we demand of it the power to impose itself.
Souriau’s thought, with his concept of instauration, also emphasizes the necessity of not taking possesssion, and above all of not psychologizing, of not talking about having a project, but of having a trajectory instead. A trajectory resulting from  a three­way assemblage: the work  in the making, the one who puts to
work,  and that which calls for its own existence, and in doing so keeps the one
who puts to work  guessing ­­ not in the sense of a secret to be discovered but in the sense of a tension between succeeding and failing,  in the sense of a situation that is questioning. That is perhaps GECo’s strength, that it exists only in
this immanent tension between succeeding and failing, between succeeding, or working together in a mode that creates an experience that sustains us, and failing, which is to say dispersing.
