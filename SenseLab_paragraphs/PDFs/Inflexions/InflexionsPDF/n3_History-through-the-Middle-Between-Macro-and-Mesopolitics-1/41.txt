I had this experience in a very intense fashion when I wrote a theater piece with Tobie Nathan and Lucien Hounkpatin, La damnation de Freud. It’s 1919 and Freud finds himself hosting in his home a silent “Senegalese infantryman” traumatized by war, who will later reveal himself to be babalawo, or therapist, in training, for whom regathering his spirits at Freud’s house is part of his trajectory. So the story  is about an encounter between two therapists, but how could that come about? “Characterizing” Freud was not so much of a problem. But Lucien Hounkpatin, who himself comes from  a family of initiates and was working with Tobie Nathan (at the Georges Devereux Centre for Ethnopsychiatry), kept saying: “No, no,  he can’t do that. He can’t make Freud say that.” And in fact, there wasn’t much of anything he could do in the situation, as Lucien understood it. This wasn’t a contemporary novel, it didn’t revolve around an absence, it wasn’t Waiting for Godot. What made writing it interesting was the fact of being obligated to an eminently recalcitrant character who refused to bend to our  designs, and who because of that acquired the capacity ot reorganize the whole plot.
