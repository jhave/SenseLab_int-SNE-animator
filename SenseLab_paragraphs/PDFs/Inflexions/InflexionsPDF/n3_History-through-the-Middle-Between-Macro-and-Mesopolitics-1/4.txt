BM : Our  research group works from  Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of micropolitics, in the framework of the ethico­aesthetic paradigm developed by Guattari. We try to imagine new forms  of intervention in public spaces which straddle art  and philosophy. We are organizing for an event that will take place in May 2009 which we call “Society of Molecules.” Today we’d like to discuss the question of micropolitics in terms of the vocabulary you use in your  last book with Philippe Pignarre, entitled La sorcellerie capitaliste. Pratiques de
désenvoûtement  (Capitalist Sorcery: Counter­Spells). We’re interested in the
fact that you  developed this vocabulary of micropolitics in parallel with your work  on the constructivist ontology of Alfred North Whitehead and Etienne Souriau. If there’s time, we’d also like to get to the following question: How  does the approach to the political that you develop relate to the academic milieu? Can we talk about constructivism as an intervention in the institution of philosophy?
