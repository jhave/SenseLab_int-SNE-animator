already there, transmitting a minimum of information, to the extent the term implies that the reader is lacking it. Instead, it has to produce new connections with what we know, or a change in the mode of connection. When I say “we” it’s about bringing into existence an open­ended “we” called forth  by those connections, whereas the academic mode of reference implies an exclusive circle whose references establish that the author belongs, that he or she has read everything they should have. This produces an aftereffect of exclusion,
often self­exclusion, of all those who will say, “because I haven’t read this or that,
I can’t understand.”
