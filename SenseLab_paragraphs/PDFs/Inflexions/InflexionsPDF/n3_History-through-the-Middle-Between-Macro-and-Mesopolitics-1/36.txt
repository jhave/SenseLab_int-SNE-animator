imperative – he was thinking in particular of Lacan’s – could be heard coming out of the mouth of a children’s judge or a social worker justifying a child being torn  from  a family judged to be “unworthy.” As a woman, I also refuse to forget the ease with which the philosophers have ratified the exclusion of women. In short, I did  not “convert” to philosophy in general. I discovered in philosophy the possibility of transforming a “wrong” that I suffered into a creation. And it’s not about theoretical creations, they only have value if they can relay away from what happened to me, if they can be relevant and can be taken up by others, in their own situations, and can help them stop suffering from  what is poisoning them.
