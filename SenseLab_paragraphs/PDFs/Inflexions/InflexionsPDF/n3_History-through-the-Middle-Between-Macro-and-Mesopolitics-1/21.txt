Here we have a functioning that goes so far as to make use of the productions that describe it ­­ even Marx’s.  Capitalism is not responsible, because it is not equipped for that. But it is apt to activate feelings of responsibility. Which is what I call stupidity. This sense of responsibility, this sad “that’s the way it has to be,” the triumph of that, is what I call stupidity, for example the dread that can overcome a modern man or woman at the mention of the word “spiritual.” However it’s actually an open door for spiritualisms, superstitions, and all sorts of regressions. Capitalism, for its part, is not stupid. Nor intelligent for that matter. That’s what I meant in La sorcellerie capitaliste when I called it sorcery. It’s a system of sorcery, not at all in an ethnographically correct sense, but in a pragmatic sense related to an issue: the issue of recognizing the sorcerer and protecting oneself. So these are the two pragmatic dimensions that stage the sorcery I am interested in: recognizing the efficacy proper to capitalism, all of its modes of capture, and experimenting with how to protect oneself from  them. This is where there is a bizarre parallel, actually an anti­parallel, between Gaia’s transcendence and the transcendence proper to capitalism. It is necessary to
learn to compose with Gaia, but it is not possible to compose with capitalism. It is not constituted in such a way that the slightest composition, the slightest negotiation, is possible. What one can attempt to do is to demoralize those who serve it, meaning certain people who have been captured by it, not in the sense of converting them, but rather in the sense of creating the possibility for
interstices that give a different texture to our  world, that give us a chance to live out the challenge posed by the intrusion of Gaia in a mode that is not barbaric.
