IS: The interesting thing is that people see different things in him, but they are not isolated from  one another, projecting what they want on him. Instead, it puts them in proximity where before they weren’t. I remember quite beautiful images from  Chicago where you saw groups of people of European heritage congratulating groups of African heritage, sharing their joy, whereas normally, even when one is politically correct, one doesn’t know how to share joy, one spreads guilt and feels sadness instead. Here, heterogeneous groups could each see something in Obama, and the different things they saw were factors that made something circulate between them. That was the success, because a chameleon in the usual sense cannot fabricate a circulation of affects, a circulation of joy, something that puts categorizations and distances into becoming without erasing them in a grand movement in which everyone becomes homogeneous under the aegis of a homogenizing “one.” This was about something that puts distances into becoming, that rejigs distances, so that something else moves across. There was joy in Chicago. It’s rare, but we can call it joy.
