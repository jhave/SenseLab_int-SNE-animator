any case, what I try to do is to create concepts that compromise the people
who take them up, in the sense of preventing them from  adopting the position of little judge, I try to create concepts that don’t have fascination power. In short, concepts that display their relativity to the situation in which they could be effective. For example, I have to address the question of the State, or of capitalism, but I don’t want to strike the pose of she who knows best, she who owns the concept capable of rivalling those already produced. It is for this
reason that I speak of “characterizing,” meaning an operation that is relative to a situation, in the pragmatic sense that one can ask what can be expected of the “character” in that situation. No end­all definition; instead, a great conceptual theater. No titanic struggle that takes the situation hostage, but rather the pragmatic of the writer who doesn’t know how to define the character she herself created and must explore that character in a mode that is always situated: what can it become capable of in this situation?
