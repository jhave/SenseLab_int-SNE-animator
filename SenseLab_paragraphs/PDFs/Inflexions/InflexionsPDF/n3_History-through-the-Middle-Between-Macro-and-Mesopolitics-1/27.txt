Of course, a success of this kind can be dismembered by those addicted to suspicion. That’s part of the unhealthy character of the milieu into which the meso ventures. It’s unhealthy as much by virtue of the interests it arouses as by the suspicions it arouses. It’s this situation of an unhealthy milieu that must be thought politically. To celebrate the success of the campaign is not to celebrate Obama as a savior. It is to celebrate the learning processes this success required, and it is knowing that this is not something that is good in itself – even if it means pronouncing  disappointment afterwards. The worst  thing that could happen is if everyone who put their hope in Obama found themselves disappointed and went back into their holes saying, “Nothing is possible!” But it seems to me that they are resisting this, that they understand that Obama is super­exposed to an unhealthy milieu, but that everything does not depend on him, to the contrary, that everything he might be able to do depends in the end on them. He did not make the serious mistake of proclaiming: “You elected me. Now  I will give you the world you  dream of.” Instead, there is the challenge to make the relay, from one situation to another. Meso practices must be maintained. They must always be remade, always reinvented. Failure is when the institution produces its own reasons for being.
