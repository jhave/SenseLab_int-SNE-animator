vulnerable option. Either capitalism must be resisted with respect to this destruction, in which case the question arises of how to address the practicioners; or, they are judged to be unworthy of being defended, to be too compromised, vulnerable, corporatist. This is an option in James’s sense because there is no position of neutrality. If we demand that a practice provide guarantees, of the kind Marx associated with the proletariat, it will prove incapable of giving it. But to ratify  its destruction is to leave the field wide open for capitalism, and that is all it asks for. The concepts I attempt to fabricate in order to “speak well of practices” despite their vulnerability, are what I call “compromising concepts.” In this sense, I’m a Jamesian. For me, when there is a fabrication of concepts, there are veritable options that are implied, so that to describe them is already a way of engaging. In this sense, even though it was Deleuze who made an apprentice philosopher of me, I am actually more Leibnizian. I refuse to honor any truth that finds its grandeur in a refusal to compromise itself with “established sentiments.”
