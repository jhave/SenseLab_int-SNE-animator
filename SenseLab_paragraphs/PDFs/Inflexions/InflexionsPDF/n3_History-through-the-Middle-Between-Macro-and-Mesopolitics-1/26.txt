This is something that has happened from  time to time in France as well. There have been neighborhood associations around issues like drugs that have succeeded, through beautiful creations, in transforming the problem of their neighborhoods being affected by drug trafficking. They come to the realization that the people they ostensibly wanted to put away in prison were their  own children, and their friends’ children, so a collective decision was made to set  up a relay mechanism whereby when a youth from  the neighborhood was put in prison, he received a postcard every day. That is an example of a device that I would call a meso invention.  It belongs to a collective, and it’s something that must self­produce, it’s not the application of a project. It seems to me that in certain cases American urban community initiatives have done this kind of thing, and more than that, that they have learned how to do it. If Obama really  did learn that, it must be related to the type of campaign he succeeded in running, in which he succeeded in empowering support committees to which he gave the wherewithal to forge a role  for themselves. I am not very optimistic about what he will be able to do now that he has radically changed his milieu, but it’s very interesting that he succeeded in it during his campaign.
