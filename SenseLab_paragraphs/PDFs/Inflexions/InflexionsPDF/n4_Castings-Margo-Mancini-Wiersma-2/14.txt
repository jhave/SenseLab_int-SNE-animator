BM:     Deborah,  I  see  you   less  as  a  collector   than   a  provoker  of  set-ups, challenging the materials to respond to the ‘chemical’ or physical encounters you propose.  Nevertheless, these  choreographies remain unseen - the  performance between materials is left to the viewer only as traces  of changes.   It seems  to me that  you’d  almost   pick  the  ‘wrong’  tool  just  to  radically experiment how  an unusual interaction would change the  surface  of things, or  to explore  how  the friction  would unfold the substance and  challenge the notion of essence.
