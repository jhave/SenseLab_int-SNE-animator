DM:  I am intrigued  by the plant  images  you have  collected.  Are some  of them pictures you have taken,  others  you have  found? There is the mundane â€“ the fall tomatoes, the  kale  and  broccoli,  as well  as the  more  exotic  (in this  part  of the world, anyway) of the fungi and  the living stones.
