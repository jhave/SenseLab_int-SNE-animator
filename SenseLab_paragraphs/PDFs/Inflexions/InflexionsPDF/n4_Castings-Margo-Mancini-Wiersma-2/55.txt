Another community project in which  I grew  scarlet  runner beans  over the course of six months was  in the realm  of art practice.  Nevertheless, I think  a lot of the gardening work  I do does not conform to the conventions of an art practice. And yet there  are other  parts  that  seem to fit perfectly i.e. the notion of different parts and  their  relationships mattering far  more  than  single  works   or  gestures;  the attention  to  context   being   paramount;  the  notions  of  change  we  have   been talking about  since  the  beginning of our  conversation; how  one  moves  amid  or through an  art  work.   Gardening helps  me  with  the  installations I make  / the installations I make  help me with  the gardens I work  on.
