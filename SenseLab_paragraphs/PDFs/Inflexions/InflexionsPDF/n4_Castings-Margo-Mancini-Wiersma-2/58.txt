And  this brings  me to your  question of what  is the role of the artist  in relation to community  and   social   issues.   Though  I  have   started  working  on   another community project  here  in Ottawa, I am still ill at ease with  the role of the artist in such  a context.   Once again,  the group conversations on the possibilities for a project   on  food   production  have   been   terrific,   but   I  do   not   where  all  the wonderful talk  will  go.  Are  we  another group of do-gooders?  Are  we  feeling guilty  about  the old myth  of artâ€™s lack of function in a world of accountability? Is there  a link with  the  other  projects  that  I have  been  talking about  with  you  and Janita?   Does there  need  to be?  What  do you  do with  the notion of art being  an elitist undertaking unless  it is based  in a community practice? I am wary  of such dichotomies.
