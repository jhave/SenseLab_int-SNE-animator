I have attached a collection  of images  (mushrooms, kale, succulents) that relate  to Deborahâ€™s Giant Okeydoke series.   There  is something grotesque about  these disintegrating  balls  of  sugar,  but  also  gorgeous.  In  their   state   of  decay   the
jawbreakers remind me of things growing, expanding, opening.
