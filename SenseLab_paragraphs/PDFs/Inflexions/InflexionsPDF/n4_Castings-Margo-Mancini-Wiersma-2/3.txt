When we first invited the artist Deborah Margo to contribute to this issue of Inflexions, the proximity between the concerns raised in her works and our own practices motivated us to embark on the conversation you read here.  Rather than conducting our curiosities through a traditional “question and answer” format, we developed a structure in which blocks of ideas were exchanged between the three of us, developing a flow of conversation that allowed us to trade projects, references and questions.  What we share here is a compilation of this process, which occurred over the course of three weeks.
