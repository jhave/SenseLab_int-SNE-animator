JW:  What  also stands out  for me is the idea  of the artist  being  located ahead of the work.   I think  Deborah touched on this positioning when she wrote  that  she is interested in provoking a series of events  – to precipitate the process - without necessarily  knowing  the  outcome.     This  location   ahead is  intriguing  to  me because it is the place  I often  find  myself  working from,  as well.
