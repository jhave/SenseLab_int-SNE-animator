things speaking rather than  doing or “I am  telling  you  what  I am  about  rather than   evoking  something  for  you  to  experience  if  you  so  choose”   while   not addressing where they  were  placed or shown.  The sculptures did  not  do  well “out in the world”, so I have been thinking what  would allow them  to be outside and  resonate.  I saw  one  of them  on  the  roof  of a car  today with  the  vehicle moving through town  – this was already a great  improvement.
