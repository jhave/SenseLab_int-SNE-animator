The dentist provides a specific  service  for their  clientele.   When  I garden I also provide  a  particular  service   that   is  usually  set  by   the   client’s   needs.	 An architect’s work  is also most often bound by such a relationship.  Art-making has the possibility of being  in a different realm.   When  I am working in the studio I am  most  often  researching  possibilities of  different issues   or  problems I  am curious about.   I do not  know  the  outcomes, but  I know  I am  working towards finding something.  Investigation?  Something akin  to  being  in  a  laboratory? There  is  a  need  for  results somewhere along  the  way  and  these  I eventually choose  to share  outside the  studio.  The opportunity of this  conversation allows me  to  know  these  issues  are  not  mine  alone,  but  are  also  shared with  others including the two  of you.   In fact, there  have  been  multiple points of connection which  I love.
