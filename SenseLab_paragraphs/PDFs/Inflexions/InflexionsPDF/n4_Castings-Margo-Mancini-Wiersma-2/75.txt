JW:  I love the idea of time-capturer.  In Deborahâ€™s work  the net is cast wide  and what  is caught is a process of disintegration - transduction - that occurs  so slowly that  it almost  appears to be immobile.  A moment is captured, but  it cannot be held because the third, this middle force, urges  the process onward.
