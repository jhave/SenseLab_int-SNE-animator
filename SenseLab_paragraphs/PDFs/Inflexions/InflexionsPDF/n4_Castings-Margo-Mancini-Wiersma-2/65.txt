Where  are you in this flow of time and  change? Have  you ever showed the procedures/performative  interactions between materials in a gallery  setting?   I am intrigued with  the allusion to emptiness, because of the nature of the gesture of  constantly capturing  change. Where   is  emptiness or  void?  Isnâ€™t  vanishing instead of a synonym for disappearing, closer to changing: transduction?
