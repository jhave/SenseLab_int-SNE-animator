BM:  I am referring to transduction as it occurs in Gilbert  Simondon’s work. According to Andrea Oliveira, who has been writing recently on Simondon: “Transduction is a chain transformation between participants from the same system, from the same associated milieu,  which  can occur in a micro or macro molecular level.  It takes place within participants who previously find themselves connected within a system, whom, as the transformations occur and propagate, are changed. In other  words, changes that re-conform the constitutive participants themselves. Such a chain transformation is structural and  composes the operating mode  of the system, in return.  According to Simondon , ‘for transduction we understand an operation which  is physical, biological, mental, social, through which  an activity  is propagated gradually in the interior of a domain.’ 1   Transduction processes extrapolates the closed  unity in itself and  it’s identity.  Simondon explains that in the process of individuation occurs a series of transductions, a progression through which  the individual is revealed, but also the milieu  that constituted it.  It conforms a mode  of
production within the individual, which  produces an actualization of that which is pre-individual. Art, in this context,  proposes a non-deterministic mode,  as if within the individual surroundings was a reminiscence of a pre-individual reality, associated to the individual, a reality  that would rebound the singular with  the collective.  Transduction, contamination, propagation, something in formation as a continuous collective  operation.”
