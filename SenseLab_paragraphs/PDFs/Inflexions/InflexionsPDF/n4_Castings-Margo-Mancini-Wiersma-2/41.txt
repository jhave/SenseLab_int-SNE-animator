The images  attached are from one of the gardens I’m working on.  Erich is a pack rat of the severest of kinds,  yet he has asked  me to reclaim  a garden strip  at the back  of his  yard  in  an  Ottawa suburb.  The  plot  I’m  working on  is about  2.5 meters by 25 meters and  is reached by a narrow path.   Every  week,  since May, I have  worked a couple  of hours, discovering all  kinds  of perennial plants that have  been  spreading for many  years,  clearing spaces  for the  ones  I’m selecting, adding new  ones.   The  over  growth and  embedded objects  are  a  challenge – should they  be  left  as  is  or  “cleaned” up?   What  is  the  balance   between my supposed  civilizing and   letting   things just  be?   What  is  a  weed?    What  is  a desirable plant?   And  what  about  the tree seedlings Erich has let grow  rampant, yet he claims he wants to have a lawn  again!
