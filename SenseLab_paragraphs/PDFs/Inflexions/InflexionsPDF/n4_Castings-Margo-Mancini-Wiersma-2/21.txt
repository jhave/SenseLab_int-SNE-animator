I  have   the   feeling   that   podiums  are   often-unnecessary  axis   for   directing movement around a  work/object:  a  suspension that  directs   the  object  into  a specific  movement towards the viewer. Sometimes we need  to prescribe this relationship, but most often it is just fear and control  taking  over.
