JW:    I enjoy  working with  concrete because of  its  colour  and  weight.  When beginning these  sculptures, I wanted something that  replicated the  city,  in  its blankness that  is not  really  a blank.   In opening up  my  casts  I always discover pockets of air, rivers  of subtle  colour  shifts,  and  the minute detail  of the surface of my  mould.  There  are  lines  that  cannot be  entirely straight.   Concrete is  a material that  though it first  appears as  impenetrable and  permanent, it cracks and  erodes just as everything else.
