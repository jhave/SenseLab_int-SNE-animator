I am  sharing with  you  both  some  images  from  Spacious Object, a show  I had recently at Galerie  Les Territoires in Montreal, Quebec.    With  this  work  I was aiming to create  abstracted fragments of things seen:  fields,  concrete structures, shadows, ripples on water.  What  I was looking for in each piece was a feeling  of spaciousness and  time slowed down in the traces of what  was, much  as I felt it in Deborahâ€™s Light-Earth Drawings.  Abstraction is a way for me to slow  the process of recognition so that  the exchange between viewer and  viewed has a chance  to
develop.
