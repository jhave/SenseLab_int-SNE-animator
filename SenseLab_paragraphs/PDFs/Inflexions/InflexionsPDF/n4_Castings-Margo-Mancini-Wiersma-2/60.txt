I think  I have come closest to understanding my responsibility as an artist  when I am in a teaching context.   I have  a certain  set of experiences that  can be shared with  others  and  in that  sharing students will  interpret them  according to their own  needs.   I do  not  teach  to have  students necessarily become  artists  rather  I hope  to  have  them  learn  more  about  what   it means  to  think  creatively.  I do believe  this  notion can  be applied to anything one  does.   How  do  we  problem solve?  How  flexible is our  thinking?  Are we able to consider an argument from a number of points of view?   What  happens when good  or bad/I love or I hate are irrelevant?  What  allows  the dentist to strive  for the best at what  they  can be and  do?
