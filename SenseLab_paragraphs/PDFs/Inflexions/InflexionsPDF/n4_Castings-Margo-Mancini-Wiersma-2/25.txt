DM:   Comments on  the  Okeydokes being  on  the  floor  were  that  they  are  at too much  of a distance from the viewer, do not engage the body  enough, that there  is a role to be played by the podium or other  such  devices  in allowing the work  to be closer to the eyes and  the mid-range of our bodies.    I have spent  so much  time thinking about  ways  of presenting work  without such  bug-a-boos that  I am now actually curious about  further alternatives including what  is the  role a podium- like device  can hold.   Last fall and  onwards, the Okeydokes were  exhibited in presentation boxes I had made  out of acrylic.   I will send  you both pictures when I am  home  once  again.   Working with  these  presentation boxes  allowed me  to stack  them  in columns and  other  configurations.  They have  now  been  tried  out in three  different exhibitions and  have led to other  possibilities.  I have  also sunk large  magnets into  them  which  allowed me to affix them  to walls,  ceilings  and onwards.  Certainly their  sense  of gravity in these  various situations has  been different, allowing for a better  sense of their  orb-like  form.  But I still like the idea of someone bending down and  picking one up  - which  people do - or lowering oneself  down to the floor to see the work  closer!  Is this my being  too much  of a control  freak?   Interestingly, when the  work  has  been  in  straight lines  on  the floor, children have felt very comfortable moving through it.
