The goats  would slowly  carve  the block out with  their  rounded licked  hollows – it was  a beautiful object especially set as it was  on an overturned pail  in a pen strewn with  straw. The process I watched the goats  engage in reminds me of the project Gnaw by Janine Antoni where she shaped a block of chocolate (and  one of lard)  with  her mouth.  Clearly  for the goats  this is an instinct to gather nutrients from  the  block  to thrive,  and  perhaps the  same  can  be said  for  the  impulse to create art – it provides the opportunity to thrive.
