understand a great  deal  about  the  world through my  finger  tips.   As  always, whether someone chooses  to touch  my  work  will largely  depend on the context where they  meet  it.  Once  a series  of sculptures I made  were  set up  on casters; every  time  I would visit  the  gallery,  all  of the  work  had  been  moved by  the audience despite there  being  no sign  inviting them  to do  so.  I tend  to take  the audienceâ€™s manipulation of the work  as a sign  that  they  have  been  interested in it,  despite when they  have  been  admonished by  a  security guard  or  gallery owner!
