DM:   I was challenged by the artist  Stephen Schofield  this year about  my putting my  work  on  the  floor,  so  I have  been  rethinking my  insistence on  not  using podiums.  I am curious to know  how  you decided to install  your  work  that  I am catching  glimpses  of  through  your   documentation.   I  love   the   idea   of  the reservoir as used  in your  print titles  and  its manifestation in the  images.   I too have   used   it  for  an  installation  I  made   once  upon a  time.    Itâ€™s  filled   with associations.
