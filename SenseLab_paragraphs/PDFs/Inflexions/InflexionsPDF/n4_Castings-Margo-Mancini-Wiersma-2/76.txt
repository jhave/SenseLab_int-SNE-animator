BM:  Although I see the attempt to display that  what  remains, it is the opposite of claiming for an  essence  of things (which  I mentioned in an  earlier correspondence). It is only  the  abilities  to  give,  to  let  parts  of it dissolve that allow  some  force  in  the  middle to  emerge to  the  surface   (an  interior axis?). Memory, in this sense, is about  physical modification and  not recollection of a set of circumstances.
