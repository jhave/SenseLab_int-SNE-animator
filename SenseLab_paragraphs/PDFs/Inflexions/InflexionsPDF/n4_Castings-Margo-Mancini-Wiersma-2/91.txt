Farmers have historically provided salt licks for their cattle, horses, and other herbivores to encourage healthy growth and development. Typically a salt lick in the form of a block is used in  these circumstances, and the block may be mounted  on a platform so that domesticated animals do not consume dirt from the ground along with the necessary salt. Salt blocks for farm animals can also be treated with  medications, which may be convenient when someone needs to medicate shy animals, or a large group of animals.
