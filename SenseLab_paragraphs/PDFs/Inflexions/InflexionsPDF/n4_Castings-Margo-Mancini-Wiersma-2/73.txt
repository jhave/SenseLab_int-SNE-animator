Usually when we  evoke  memory it refers  to an  event  as a static  circumstance, something we lived,  but which  remains behind and  that  we re-visit  mentally - or re-collect.  I see in your  procedures something different: what  does  remain? How does  it link to an origin  of forms,  or transgress what  we thought to be an essence of the material?
