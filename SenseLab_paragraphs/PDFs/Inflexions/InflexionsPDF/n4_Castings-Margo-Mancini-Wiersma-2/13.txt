becomes  much  larger  than  what  I have traced;  sun, earth  axis and  turning. I have paper forms  of some  of  the  shapes the  sun  has  taken  as  it  passed through a window and  made  patterns on the floor, made  in Sackville many  years  ago.  I’ve wondered what  would happen if I made  them  into  solid  forms  and  then  placed them  in a space  without windows (a typical  gallery  situation).  They  look  like these  modernist configurations; cast in concrete they  would take on a further muteness (as  in  dumbness), but  yet  they  derive from  something so  alive  and fleeting.    Roland  Poulin’s  early   concrete  works   appeal  to  me  for  the   same reasons, far from the drama of so much  of his more  recent  work.
