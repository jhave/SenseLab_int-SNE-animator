JW:   This is why  I love the idea  of casting  the drawings of captured light â€“ I am becoming more  and  more interested in the idea of pushing things to their limit so that   they   almost   spill   into   their   opposite.   Already  the   paper  shapes  you mentioned that  capture the light  are only  a representation of the movement you were  tracking. I can imagine how  creating three-dimensional blocks of these drawings would provide them  with  a  further dumbness, but  perhaps also  a deeper voice, simply because the opposite is always there,  in everything.
