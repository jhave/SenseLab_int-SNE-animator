JW:  The mundane images,  as you say, are ones I took myself  at my parents’ farm in Southern Ontario, the  rest  I have  collected from  other  sources.  Yes, it’s  the slow  pace of things growing, as well as the spectacle of plants seen up close that refers   me  back  to  the  Giant  Okeydokes.  Growth can  seem  so  slow  but  then suddenly the plant  has become  something else entirely. I imagine the experience of looking at the jawbreakers evolve  over  time is a similar  process of discovery - time manifest in remarkable points.
