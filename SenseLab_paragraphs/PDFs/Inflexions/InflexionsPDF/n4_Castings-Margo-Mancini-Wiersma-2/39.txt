DM:   For the  past  six years  I have  been  working in the  summer as a gardener. This year I have  more  than  twenty clients  and  am working outside steadily from mid-April (when classes  ended at the  University of Ottawa where I teach  part- time)  until  the end  of August.  The smallest gardens have  been  planting pots  or tending to a small strip  outside a condo  project  whereas the largest  are elaborate gardens situated next  to  the  Ottawa river.   Some  are  of my  design, others  are tending to someone else’s.  I am immersed in plants and  their  changes, though I don’t think  this can be called nature. Gardening is about  making all sorts of environments – installations? – following different clients’  needs.   Artifice  and artificial,  most  certainly.  Yet the  cycle  of plants does  belong  to  nature.  Seeds have  germinated or  root  systems have  revived.  Some  I have  helped along,  a great  many  have  their  established cycles taking  pretty much  care of themselves. We have  passed the  mid-summer point  and  I can  already see  the  signs  of the growing season   moving along   to  its  inevitable end,  returning to  dormancy.
