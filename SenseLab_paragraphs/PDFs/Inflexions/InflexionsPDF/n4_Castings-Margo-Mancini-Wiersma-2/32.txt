JW:   The density of marks in the broken link you  encountered, Bianca, reminds me of Agnes  Martin’s grid  paintings. Here  again  I feel as though there  is both  a fullness and  an  emptiness, working together to describe the  indescribable.  We give  form  to the  formless, always working on the  edge  of something that  can’t quite  be written about,  can’t quite  be drawn, captured, shown. But we can give an  impression.  The  container gives  shape to  an  inside  and  an  outside.  Lines create borders between something and nothing.
