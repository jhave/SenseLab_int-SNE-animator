JW:  The  transient way  that  the  Okeydokes, salt  licks,  and  even  the  Light-Earth Drawings capture a moment seem  very  much  akin  to memory for me.  I agree  – memory is not  static,  but  rather a process that  occurs  in the  present.  We don’t return, we  create  anew  with  threads of thought that  have  moved with  us  all along.   In Deborah’s work  the  gesture of adding water is a memory in process, continually renewing itself in the present moment.
