series – so do I.   Something small but fantastical. Also something still changing. They  are  ephemeral works.   I don’t  know  how  long  they  will  last,  though the hardened sugar has stuck  around longer  than  I expected.  Still, it easily  reacts  to water/humidity,  potentially continuing to  “bloom” and  “cloud” over,  though the lacquered, sanded surfaces have stayed clear so far.
