DM:    Agnes   Martin.  I  have   such  respect  for  her  work   although it  is  very different from  where I come  from.   There  is a search  for  perfection that  is far away  from  the messiness of daily  living  which  I deeply love and  wonder about. You see the "messiness" also has such  a vital  presence in art and  I don't want  to deny  it – it’s what  makes  things feel alive.   But I also love the moments of contemplation that Martin offers.
