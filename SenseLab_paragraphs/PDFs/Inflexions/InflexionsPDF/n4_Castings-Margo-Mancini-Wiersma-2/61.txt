JW:  I don’t have  much  experience working on community based  projects  as an artist.   I’m  involved in community in many  ways,  but  I don’t participate as an artist  necessarily.  Or I do in part,  but not with  the goal of a completed project  at the end  of the process.  The questions that  have  come  up  around the role of the artist  are  definitely ones  that  I consider as  well,  especially when preparing to mount a show.   What is my responsibility? The gallery  space is a difficult  one for me because it can be such a place removed but I also love it for the remove it can provide.  I suppose this  question about  the  role  of the  gallery  is very  similar  to the  discussion we  have  had  about  how  to use  or not  use  plinths for display.  I think  my sense of responsibility as an artist  is no different than  the responsibility I feel as a person in the world. I don’t want  to alienate people or make  them  feel unsafe.  I aim to offer a space that  is open  enough that  many  ways  in and  out are possible.   Much  like a conversation, I hope  that  ideas  and  points of connection proliferate.  I am  still  turning over  this  question of role  and  responsibility and how actions  spill over into art.
