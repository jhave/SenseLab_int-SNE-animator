exaggeration or a fiction, but I am not convinced. Certainly it is selective.   I have lived  with  the  same  person for  close  to  thirty years  and  what  he  chooses  to remember and  what  I do, about  the same  circumstances, is completely different. And   yet  I  also  know,   based   on  experience,  that   many   of  my  memories  of particular individuals – their  smell,  the  sound of  their  voice,  how  they  hold themselves  –  are   more   accurate  than   I  thought  possible.  Sometimes these memories have shocked me in how they have  sustained particularities of another person when I see them  after many  years.
