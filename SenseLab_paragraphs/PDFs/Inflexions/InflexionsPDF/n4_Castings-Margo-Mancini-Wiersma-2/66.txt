DM:  Good  question about  where am  I in  the  flow  of time  and  change in  the situations I  set  up.   I  do  take  some  responsibility  in  provoking a  stream of changes in the sugar and  salt works  and  also have  some  control  over  when they can come to some  point  of stopping or freezing in their  deterioration. Inevitably the  work  will  return to being  dust  one  day  which  I am  fine  with.   I donâ€™t take much  stock  in  the  permanence of art  works.   Not  much  of a surprise there,  I guess.   Yes, I have  been  interested in the  procedures/performative  interactions being  made  more  public.   I have  made  preliminary designs where a sugar  ball
/okeydoke would be slowly  transformed in a gallery  setting, but  so far none  of the spaces  where I applied to show  such  a project  have  bitten!  A slow  stream of water would bathe  the  ball  of sugar and  collect  again  below  it, forming a new work.   Eventually the original form  would no longer  exist, but its residue would become   something new.   I  have  also  grown scarlet  runner beans  on structures/supports made  from what  I found in the garbage and  am often in conversation with  people living  in  the  surrounding area  commenting on  the growth of the plants over a period of six months.
