I am still working on understanding what  you  mean  about  being  located ahead of the setting it is observing. Do you mean  the work  anticipates its own  changes before  they  happen?  Perhaps not, but I will wait to hear  back from  you, Bianca.
I do  hope  for  a  conversation between the  materials I choose,  the  stress  they undergo and  my  decision-making  â€“ a series  of events  that  I try  to precipitate without  necessarily  knowing  their   outcome.   Eventually,  when  it  becomes endlessly predictable, I move  on.  This came up in a lecture  I participated in last year with  the artist  Eric Cameron. He is satisfied with  repeating the same  events over  and  over  again  for years  on  end,  while  also  not  knowing the  form  of the outcome, yet  he sticks,  pretty much,  to the  same  materials (paint  and  gesso).   I think  I am more  restless.
