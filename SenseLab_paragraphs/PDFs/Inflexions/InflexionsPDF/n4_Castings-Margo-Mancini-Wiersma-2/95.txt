Are  you  okay  with  art works  being  “beautiful”?  Today,  often  in contemporary art,   I  find   it  has   become   like  a  four   letter   (swear)   word,  something  to  be embarrassed about,  an insult,  or having a subversive connotation. Strange.   I understand your  use of it being  something else altogether – that  it is possible to be visually attracted to art works  and  this is a positive experience. It is not what I look for necessarily when I look at other  works,  but I believe  it definitely has its place.    It  can   act   as   a  lure   for   an   art   experience  to   unfold  into   further connotations, associations, meanings, other  possibilities.  Yes, that  would be my hope  in making something beautiful.
