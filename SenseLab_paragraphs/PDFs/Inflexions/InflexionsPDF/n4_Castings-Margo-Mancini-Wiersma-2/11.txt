Where   to   begin?   First   off,  nothing  is  immobile.   Everything  is  constantly changing - whether we  notice  it or not.   Art  making can  be a way  of trying to slow time down for oneself  or to at least attempt to be aware of its intransigence. Potential movement? As the recent  earthquake in Ontario and  Quebec  reminded many  people, rather it is our perception of the constancy of movement. We tend to want  to believe things can be at a standstill, but they arenâ€™t, even when you are stuck in traffic and  it appears nothing will ever change.
