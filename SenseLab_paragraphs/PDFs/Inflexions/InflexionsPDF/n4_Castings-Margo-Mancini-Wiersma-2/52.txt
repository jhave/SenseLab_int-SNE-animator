BM: Deborah, I would be interested in hearing about  your  community-based projects  and  other  sorts  of  collaborative practices and  how  they  relate  to  my seeing  you as a provocateur of relations between bodies/materials.  I would like to learn  from you about  the one big question thatâ€™s been chasing me lately: when and  how  do these  practices become  an artwork and  when do they  remain in the realm  of experience that  informs your  perception as an artist,  but are not directly art?  When  does  gardening conform to an  art  practice, or a piece,  for example? What  is the role of the artist  in relation to community and  social issues?  Should we be more  responsible than  a dentist, for instance?
