BM:   I am  also  struck  by  the  attempt to  collect  traces  of time  passing. In  the casting  series it happens in the scale of a day - so, at first you are the one marking the points where sunlight draws shades at the window. After you leave, it is the sun,  again,  that  will  highlight each  mark,  striking the  different drawings along the  day.  The  event,  which  was  marked at  the  walls  will  never  have  the  same shape again,  even,  and  one can notice  the slight  differences once the sun  hits the drawings on another day.
