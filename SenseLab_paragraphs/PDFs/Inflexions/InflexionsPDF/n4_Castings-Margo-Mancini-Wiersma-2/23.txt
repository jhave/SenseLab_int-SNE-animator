haven’t  resolved this.   In some  ways  I like  the  supposed neutrality of a 3-foot podium, but of course  it isn’t really  neutral, and  yes, I think  the impulse to use it is based  in a need  to control  the  posture of the  body,  and  the  ways  of seeing, more than  actually opening the work  up to other  possibilities.
