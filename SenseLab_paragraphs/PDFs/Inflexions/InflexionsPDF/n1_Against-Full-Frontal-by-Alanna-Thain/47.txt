The film portion of L’Ange de la Mort was shot in an anatomy museum; Forsythe is hemmed in by long rows of display cases, and  close-up images  of the suspended decay  of human flesh are continually intercut with  these images  and offered  up for our eyes. Fragments of Andy  Warhol films are also sprinkled throughout the performance. Like Jovic, Forsythe’s performance dramatizes re- animation as an imperfectly subjectivized experience. The point  of view of the other  in me is initially  (both in the text and in our recognition of Forsythe) that of the drama of celebrity  and fame (of which  Warhol is the great  philosopher). Celebrity becomes  less a form of ambivalent liveliness than  a prolongation of death in life, a static contraction of sense. However, in the anatomy museum, the jars of fleshy bits are not only a memento mori, an anachronistic precursor to our contemporary preservatives of celluloid and video  tape. The jars become complicated in their  uncanny identifiability; in their inert objectivity, these morsels of flesh become reanimated by their availability to the eye. Like in Stan Brakhage’s The Act of Seeing with One’s Own Eyes, where light, shadow and  colour are released from inanimate bodies  in the filming  of an autopsy, the apparitional quality of the jars as curved screens  invites  a movement of display, rather than staying as inert material of recognizable and dead images.  There is a persistence and  consistence to moving images  that exceeds  the subjective level, through a multiplication of the ‘other’ points of view in me.
