What is the conceptual value  of the synthespian? One of its fascinating and disquieting elements centers  on the question of the origin  and  source  of performance. The synthespian is a felt assemblage--felt, because it can produce an effect that robotics  researcher Masahiro Mori dubbed the “uncanny valley”. Synthespians resembling humans were affectively acceptable to viewers to a point  of about  95% similarity, at which  point  the minuscule vibration of difference becomes  disquieting and  even disturbing (Mori, 1970: 33–35). While this very intimation of minor  difference in the face of iconic similarity can be a powerful source  of subversive effect, there is nothing inherently creative  or
processual about  the synthespian, its disquieting affects being easily contained in
affections  of laughter, fear, disgust, pleasure, boredom. However, as played with during Fabre’s performance, the synthespian’s special  associations with  the “re-
