In other  performances I saw in that same winter, participation took tangible forms such as the invitation to close my eyes and  take the hand of the person next to me, or in dancers repeatedly asking  the seated audience to rise out of their seat as they apologetically scrambled past them  to seats at the end of the
row, only to immediately make their way out again,  while wearing no clothes.  [3]
L’Ange de la Mort equally evoked a participatory sensibility in me, although I was not actively  directed nor invited to shape the unfolding of the show.  In this article, I want  to explore  this feeling of interactivity as emerging from three aspects of the piece: the screen  that does not fix attention but solicits movement, the live performer as synthespian, and finally my own sense, during the performance, of becoming “all eyes”. Through these three  elements, I consider
the stakes  of the “aesthetic paradigm” for Guattari, as such a process of
“emergent alterfication” or what  we might  think  of as a “responsible anonymity” of qualitative change, and  how intermedial dance  performance has a privileged place for helping us think  through the challenges of life in an age defined by the audio-visual archive.  Dance’s privileged place derives not from its longtime affiliation with  presence and  the materiality of bodies,  but from its “paradoxical body”, already doubled in its evocation of a complex temporality, always in the process  of becoming something else (Gil, 2006: 21-35).
