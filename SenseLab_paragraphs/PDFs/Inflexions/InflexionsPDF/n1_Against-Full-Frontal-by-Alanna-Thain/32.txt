The break  or gap between sound and image in cinema  is for Deleuze the best illustration of this. In the same way, Jovic performs an audiovisual body,  giving the piece a richness that does not simply oppose her live body to Forsythe’s recorded image.  Instead, Jovic’s performance makes  us feel the gap characteristic of, but not limited to, an audiovisual archive,  between the visible and the articulable. As Deleuze writes,  this gap, a paradoxiacal non-relation that is also a relation, is one of potential, force or sensation. It is in this way, and  not merely through her explicit citation  of familiar phrases from Gollum, that Jozic’s performance evokes  the synthespian, where frequently voice acting (rarely synthesized) contaminates a body  language not properly its own, while  the body contaminates the voice. In this way, a chaotic unity  is produced.
