In the culture of the audio-visual archive,  how and when do we shift from a logic of exposure and distanced visibility to one of encounter, feeling and  an otherness at the heart  of the self that is our openness to the world? In Chaosmosis, Felix Guattari writes  of the value  of an “aesthetic paradigm” which  holds  a privileged place in reorienting our experience towards the production of collective assemblages of enunciation (Guattari, 1995). I explore  this production in Jan Fabre’s intermedial dance  performance installation L’Ange de la Mort (2006), via a series of “missed encounters”, a detoured intersubjectivity that the performance stages  in order to amplify the impersonality of sensation. In this way, the performance taps into a doubled rhythm on the edge of chaos--between intimacy and  estrangement--as a means of generating the new. The rhythm is two-fold--an intensification of feeling that is simultaneously a loss of one’s self in feeling: a
non-recuperated loss, an intuitive derangement of limitations such that you are
no longer  what  you were, and you feel it, like a doubled heartbeat. In the above quote  from Massumi, sensation as sentio is understood as an otherness that speaks within us, a folding of the outside in the interior that is an “aesthetic contraction” of sensation. Here,  one senses what  Guattari calls the “point of view of the other  in me” (Guattari, 1995: 64). Against a logic of full frontality, understood as exposure and delimited self-presence, we are instead not before the work  of art, we are in it.
