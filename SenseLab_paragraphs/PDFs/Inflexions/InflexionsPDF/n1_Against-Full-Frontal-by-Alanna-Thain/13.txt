the audience took their seats on the floor, some just inches away  from the stage. Jovic lay on this stage, curled into immobility, her face hidden from view.  The intimacy of the seating, an eye-level  relation to the other  spectators, meant that the audience was a part  of the show  as much  as the visual  spectacles of dance and projection were  meant to attract the gaze.  The sense of mass surveillance--at any moment, we could  watch  someone else watching the show  or catch them watching us--and distributed spectacle--we couldn’t help but pick up reflections of the performance’s effect on the other  faces in our peripheral vision--created
the effect of a resonance chamber, a simultaneous scattering of attention that,
even when the lights dimmed and the projection began,  had refocused and distributed my sensory awareness in ways  that I’m not used  to when watching live dance  performances. The setup was simple  but extremely effective, and allowed Fabre to tap into the vast potential of “installing the body”, a contemporary obsession of intermedial performance. [2]
