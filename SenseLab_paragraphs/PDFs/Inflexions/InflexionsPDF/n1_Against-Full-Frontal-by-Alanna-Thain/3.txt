Every thing,  however banal, is, and is beautiful, insofar  as it is a bearer  of otherness (that)  and impinges (this). If there was an aesthetic “cogito”, this- that would be it. But it is a “cogito” that is a “sentio”: I feel. Although it is “I” who feels, the existence  the feeling verifies is not “mine”. It is immediately the world's. “I feel, therefore everything is”. Everything that is felt is: that. Differs. Which is why I also am, in this feeling. The world and I exist, in difference, in the encounter. In the feeling. Being is in sensation (Massumi, 1997: 745-782).
