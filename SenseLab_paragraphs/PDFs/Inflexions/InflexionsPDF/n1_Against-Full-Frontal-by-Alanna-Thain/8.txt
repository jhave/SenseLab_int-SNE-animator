How  do certain  semiotic  segments achieve  their autonomy, start to work  for themselves and  to secrete  new fields of reference? It is from such a rupture that an existential singularisation correlative to the genesis  of new coefficients of freedom will become  possible. This detachment of an ethico- aesthetic “partial object” from the field of dominant significations corresponds both to the promotion of a mutant desire  and  to the achievement of a certain  disinterestedness. Here I would like to establish a bridge between the concept of a partial object (object “a” as theorised by Lacan) that marks the autonomisation of the components of unconscious
subjectivity, and  the subjective autonomisation relative to the aesthetic object
(Guattari, 1995: 13).
