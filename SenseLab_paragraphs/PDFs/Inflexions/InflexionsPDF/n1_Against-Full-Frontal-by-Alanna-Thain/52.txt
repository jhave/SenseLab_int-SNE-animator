A tension between command and description emerges: as Forsythe speaks “click” “click” “click”, the image disintegrates into a sequence of fast cuts, of close-up images  of faces, bodies  and  above  all eyes.  The piece involves a kind  of dispossession of the eye/I, as he continues: “I am back from death/ and  on my way to the parting/To the sound of a thousand cameras/ I am the seductive self- portrait of a monstrous landscape/ constantly filming  my own blue eyes/ that infamous look/ that look/ the beginner and eradicator that studies people in flight/ I have seen these eyes/ I have seen my body  in these eyes/ so many times/ over so many  years/ at so many  events/ I see myself again  and  always/ being famous is so simple/ But I live today/ After my death/ and so it is extremely difficult. To become  again  unknown” (Fabre, 2000).
