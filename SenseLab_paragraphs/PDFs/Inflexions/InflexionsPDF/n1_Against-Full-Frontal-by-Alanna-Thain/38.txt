Both Forsythe and Jozic as recognizable bodies  are immediately doubled as synthespians, cinematic bodies  that exist on screen  and off.  The synthespian (or “vactor”-virtual actor) is a term developed in the 1980s but popularized in the late 1990s, generally referring to digitally created actors.  It remains, however, a portmanteau term.  [6] Throughout its brief history, the synthespian has raised practical and  philosophical questions about  agency,  ownership of images,  the loss of a sense of history and lived  embodiment in the face of simulacra, and the “disjunctive” nature of the audio-visual archive.  That these questions repeatedly turn  on the rights  of the indexical referent (ie. the actor) behind the image indicates the limited view of subjectivity that effaces the labour and  work  of, for example, digital artists,  an example of the deadening effects of what  Guattari calls the capitalist assemblage that shuts  down the potential of relationality as such. [7] Jozic’s performance is repeatedly evocative of screen  synthespians in several  ways,  and indicates the affiliations of the synthespian to madness, hallucination, delire  and a reconfiguration of the normal coordinates of space and time.  The synthespian is always a figure outside of normal time, whether the reanimation of a dead celebrity, a digital double that can perform with  the live “model” of itself or the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park, giving  us a vertiginous
sense of history, emerging out of the past. These images  of pop culture ripple the
skin of Jovic’s performance like latent  parasites.
