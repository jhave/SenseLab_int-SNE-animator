The text ends with the wish to “seek forgetfulness in losing myself in the
crowd/I want  to forget myself/And dance  in the blue”.  This blue throughout the text has been that of his “blue eyes”, eyes that are repeatedly of a doubled vision-
-his own eyes which  are also “cameras”, eyes which  are “possessed” by others,
even as they are a means of becoming everyone else.  This doubled vision becomes  movement-vision via an intensification of the movement between fixed positions--floating and dancing as the only possible response. In doing  so, the eyes become  a zone of qualitative sensation, what  Forsythe describes as “danc(ing) in the blue”.
