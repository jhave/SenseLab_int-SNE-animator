How  did Fabre’s piece activate the potential for forming “collective assemblages”, or rhythmic structures, dancing on the edge of chaos? The response lies in a series of elements that compose the event,  not least its own
‘eventful’  quality. Here, I will explore  three main  modes of re-potentialization
that occur in the ‘eventfulness’ of the piece. Firstly, via the analysis of Jovic’s performance in terms  of the “synthespian”, as a means of understanding the affective  contagion of live/ lived  bodies  by the audio-visual archive. Secondly, by examining the screen images  as inviting a distracted and distributive attention. In this performance space, the screens  do not work  as an invitation to scopic mastery or the focalized, immersive attention that substitutes a world of
light and  shadow for ‘reality’, but redistribute our attention between and  around
them,  allowing us to feel the sensation of image/ space relationality minimized in our usual  experience of the ‘cinema’. Lastly, by exploring the feeling I developed during the piece, of becoming “all eyes”, as a mode  of movement- vision  particular to the perception of “emergent alterfication” and its ethico- aesthetic potential.
