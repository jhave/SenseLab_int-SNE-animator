different end, one less concerned with  a finalistic  concept  of death than  with  a Deleuzo-Guattarian notion  of death as an intensive experience of de- and re- composition. An intensive vision  is curiously not “grounded” in perspective. It is a vision  that has become  delirious precisely because of its doubleness, its accumulation of relative perspectives. This is not seeing  one’s self through an other’s eyes: not a shared perspective, but the felt doubleness of the exchange between virtual and actual  dimensions. A multitude of perspectives make our clair-voyance murky, opening onto a clair-obscur future that is the intimation of difference in itself; a figural  mode  of vision  that hesitates between seeing  and reading. In Foucault, Gilles Deleuze describes the tension between the visible and the articulable as that of a non-relation that is a relation (Deleuze, 1988: 33). It is not that there  is an immediate contact  or isomorphism between the two; rather, relation that is non-relation, where the impossibility to say what  we see is
defined by a gap of power or force--affect.   Between  the seen and the said, a world of feeling, more  or less intense.
