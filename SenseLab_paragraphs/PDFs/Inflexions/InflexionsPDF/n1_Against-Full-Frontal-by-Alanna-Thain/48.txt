The film only begins  some time into the performance. Forsythe appears in a fixed shot at the end of a long passageway between display cases in the empty
anatomy museum, out of place in his liveness,  while being almost  a part of the
museum itself, in his exposure (wearing only a pair of shorts)  and in his humble presence (there is little that is explicitly  virtuosic about  his performance). A strong sense of the vulnerability of being on display accompanies his filmed image,  contrasting vividly with  the self-possession that accompanies Jovic’s aggressive territorialization of the small stage space. Forsythe’s image towers over the space--he is larger  than  life.  His doubled monumentality--both his celebrity and fame (a key theme  of Fabre’s original text) as well as his disproportionate scale (larger  than Jovic) is made  more resonant by a curious impersonality in his massive presence. An interior distance in his gaze is made all the stranger by the fact that the onscreen image  is continually coming  face to face (without acknowledging) with its own image  on the screen  opposite across the performance space: another example of the missed encounters that open other vectors  of engagement for the audience to enter.  The lack of recognition, the difficulty of seeing  oneself is also part  of a strategy of escape and  fugitive movement. A live body in a dead setting, Forsythe doesn’t rely on a display of vigor  or vitality as a means  of generating a contrast; rather, it is the thoughtfulness, the delay  in his sometimes hesitant speech,  his abstracted gaze
