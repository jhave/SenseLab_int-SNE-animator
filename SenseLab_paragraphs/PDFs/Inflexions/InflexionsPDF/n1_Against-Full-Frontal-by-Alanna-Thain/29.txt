Jovic’s paradoxical body  immediately undercuts any sense that the live performing body is self-evidently present, by drawing on the disjunctive gap of the visible and the articulable through a process  of self-fabulation and narrativization. The opening of the show  stages  this gap not through spoken language but through sensible  sound that rhythmically infects all future instances of language with its resonance--we are made  to see speech  via bodily performance and  delay.  Lying curled up on the platform from the time that the audience has entered, in a bra top and shorts, Jovic begins  to move  discrete parts of her body  in segmented and disjunctive articulations. Every movement is accompanied by a guttural noise, like a rusty  machine grinding to life, at odds with  the evident control  of each gesture. The noises sound like a body  in pain, but the visual  image is of smooth but segmented control.  These noises are amplified by her head-set microphone--they at once emanate from the body  and are disjunct from it, the voice instead animating a sense of an interior landscape that is not that of a subject, but rather an exterior made interior, a folding in
place--the topological reversibility of ‘movement executed, movement
described’. Jean-Luc Godard once said: “to describe is to observe mutation”, and this is the precise  sensation Jovic’s coming  into being evokes.  [5] These a- signifying sounds set the stage and infect, by affective  contamination, all speech that follows,  which  never  resolves into the fully articulable but remains full of excess information. Through the rest of the performance, her speech  is thus always what  Guattari calls “full speech”, a completely embodied intelligibility in tension with  sensibility.
