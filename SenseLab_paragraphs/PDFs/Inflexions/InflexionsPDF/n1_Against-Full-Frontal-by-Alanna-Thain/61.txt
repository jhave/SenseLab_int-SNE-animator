frontal  is to be caught up in such sensation--to avoid  the revelatory lie that there is a truth behind images  simply waiting to be exposed, and instead to feel images differently, to sense the difference in their repetition. As Forsythe performs onscreen, his danced movements contorting in the confined space between display cabinets, at times chopped into editing and then  recomposing in long
shot and  long take, the refrain  “I dance  and I float and  that’s all I know  how to
do” suggests that such movement is the key to evading a fixity of the self as seen through specular vision. This self-evasion is synaesthetically seen in the visibility of the audience, as a shifting abstraction of mobile  faces: neither mirrors nor “affection-images” capturing the affective valences of the piece and translating them  into explainable emotion, but the expressive mobility of a mosaic of faces--a desubjectified series of subjective reactions, a multiplication of points of view-- subject and  object all at once. This distracted and  mobile  attention, as well as the distribution of the screens  on all 4 walls of the space, likewise intensified both
my own sense of peripheral vision  and the back space of my body.  Something
was always happening behind my back, pulling against the full frontality of my own eyes and scattering their blue across the surface  of my skin.
