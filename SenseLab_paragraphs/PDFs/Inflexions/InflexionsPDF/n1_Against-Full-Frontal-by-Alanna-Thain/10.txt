Fabre’s L’Ange de la Mort began  as a text, written in 1996, to be performed by dancer and choreographer William  Forsythe. Inspired by “un être androgyne, Andy  Warhol” and dedicated to Forsythe, Fabre’s notes indicate that L’Ange de la Mort is a “monologue for a man,  a woman or a hermaphrodite”. [1] Forsythe’s difficulty in committing the text to memory led to the making of a filmed  version of the piece, shot in the Musée  d’Anatomie de Montpellier (Scholl, 2008).
