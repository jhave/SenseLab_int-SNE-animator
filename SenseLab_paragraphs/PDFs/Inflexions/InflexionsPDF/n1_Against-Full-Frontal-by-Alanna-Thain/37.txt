Guattari’s notion of the “point of view of the other  in me” is more akin to Massumi’s movement-vision than  to mirror-vision -- not as ‘seeing oneself through the eyes of another’, but as the “accumulation of relative perspectives and passages” between them.  Fabre’s use of film in this installation suggests that cinema  less mirrors reality  than  provokes these sensational delires.
