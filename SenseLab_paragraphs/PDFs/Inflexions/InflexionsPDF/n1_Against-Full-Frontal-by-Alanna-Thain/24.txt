Rhythm as sensation is marked by a duality, an intensive experience that sweeps us up in immediacy and a sense of being possessed from the outside, a radical opening of interiority such that interiority is only a folding of the outside, an unlivable volumetrics of bodily  space, contortive, disjunctive, disorienting and yet effortlessly caught up in motion. Like in Bacon’s introduction of a seed of rhythm into his chaotic portraits as deterritorializations of the body,  in Fabre’s piece rhythm provides a sense of in-consistency in renewed openness.
