chance  and  the unexpected as really two sides of the same coin. In Chaosmosis, Guattari argues for the aesthetic paradigm as a way of “re-enchanting” a world where too often a “disquieting strangeness” that signals  the emergence of the new or unexpected, of process itself, is recaptured and reduced to known Universes of Reference  (as in the recapture of Astaire’s delightfully uncanny dance  in a tedious Heimlich of domesticity) (Guattari, 1995: 105). Throughout L’Ange de la Mort, the question of relationality is highlighted through a series of
inquiries into the relations of subjectivity that miss dialogical clarity, escaping the
closed circuit that reinforces a sense of (inter)subjective consistency and instead calling attention to the creative modalities of the production of subjectivities. Guattari argues that “the play of intensity of the ontological constellation is, in a way, a choice of being not for the self, but for the whole  alterity of the cosmos and the infinity of time”,  the seeking  of new forms  of value  , an ethical alternative to capitalist binaries of value  (1995: 53). Deleuze writes  that “cinema spreads an experimental night” over us, a space for the recomposition of bodies; Fabre’s installation participates in such an experimental night  in its invitation to spectators not to lose but to reconfigure their habits  of perception, to sense their self-referentiality in participating in movement-vision (Deleuze, 1989: 194). Bearing witness to the becoming of a creative act means an ethical responsibility in this piece, not to interpret, but to open  up to the disquieting and  the strange-- the way in which  images  have an undetermined life of their  own.
