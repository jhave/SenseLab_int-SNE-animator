Barbara  Creed  suggests that despite arguments which  suggest that a synthespian could  in fact “perform” as well as a flesh and blood  actor, it will still lack an unconscious, here understood as the source  of a “heimlich” doubleness of actor and  character that we as viewers recognize and  respond to. Creed,  for whom the synthespian is itself an angel of death, signaling the demise of cinema  as a celluloid based  life form, asks: “How much  of the power of the experience of identification is derived from the spectator’s awareness----conscious or not--that the star as person and as character on the screen  has undergone experiences common to the human subject?”  (Creed,  2003: 167). This rather ironic mode  of “recognition” of the unconscious as familiarity suggests something quite
different from Guattari’s expanded sense of the unconscious as latency  (a
properly audio-visual use of this term),  a sensibility of milieu  as expanded relationality. It is this sense of milieu,  of qualitative becoming--the world in me-- that makes  the link between Jovic’s explicit citationality and partial
subjectivation of the synthespian and  Forsythe’s screenic  on-scenity.
