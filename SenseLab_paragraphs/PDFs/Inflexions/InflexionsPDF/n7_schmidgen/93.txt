Despite the  fact that  the  reflex  book  refers  to and  relies  on similar  authors and findings as Merleau-Ponty and  other  phenomenologists, Canguilhem has clearly separated the history of concepts from Husserlian thought. Instead, he situated it close  to  structuralism. For  example, when  defending  Foucault’s  The  Order  of Things against the polemic criticisms of Jean-Paul Sartre and  his followers, Canguilhem assigned the  following task  of immediate interest to contemporary philosophy:  “substituting for  the  primacy  of  experienced  or  reflexive consciousness  the  primacy  of  concepts,  systems,  or  structures” (Canguilhem
1994: 88-89).
