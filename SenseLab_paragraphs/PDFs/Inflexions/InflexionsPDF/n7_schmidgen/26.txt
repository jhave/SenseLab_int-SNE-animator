In the 18th century, the theory of organic “sympathies” and  the disconnection of sensation and  consciousness gradually contributed to a focus on the periphery of neuro-anatomical structures and  psycho-physiological processes. Jean Astruc (1684-1766),  Robert   Whytt   (1714-1766),  Johann   Unzer   (1727-1799),  and   Julien Legallois   (1770-1814)  demonstrated  that   reflex  movements  could   not  just  be localized in the cerebellum, but  also in the spinal  chord  and  even  in paracentral nerve  tissue.  It also  became  clear  that  sensations which  triggered reflex  actions were not necessarily accompanied by consciousness, although they could  be.
