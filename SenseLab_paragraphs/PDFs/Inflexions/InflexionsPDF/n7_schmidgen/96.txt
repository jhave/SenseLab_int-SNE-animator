“formation” of concepts, this can be taken  in a biological  sense. The formation of concepts usually seems  to take  a one-way street:  from  the subject  to the relation between subject  and  object.  According to  Canguilhem, it  equally follows   the other  way,  i.e. it also  goes  from  the  object  to the  relation between subject  and object. Life produces forms  that  prepare, that  “invite” the formation of concepts. Long before  life scientists started to grasp phenomena by means  of technological analogies, long  before  they  come  up  with  drawings that  allow  for serialization and  comparison, the structure of life manifested itself in similar  manners, e.g. as circumscribed forms  that  reproduce  themselves. In  this  sense  one  can  speak indeed of “structuralism” with  regard to Canguilhem, a structuralism that reconnects human knowledge to the  evolving structures of life. This ‘biological structuralism’  should prompt further investigation of  the  role  of  biology  and technology in the formation of scientific concepts.
