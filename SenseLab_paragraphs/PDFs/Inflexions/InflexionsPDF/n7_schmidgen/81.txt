As a consequence the formation of the reflex concept  cannot  be seen as a simple result  of experimental work  in the laboratory. Instead it stems  from  “speculative modifications” (FR 62) of older  theories and  above  all from the use of “analogical imagination” (FR 170). The  most  general prerequisite for  this  speculative and imaginative   practice  is   the   existence    of   forms    that    can   be   related  and “assimilated” to one  another. With  regard to Descartes and  Willis,  Canguilhem mainly addresses the assimilation of two  kinds  of forms:  biological  and technological. Basically, the concept  of reflex relies on assimilating a biological phenomenon to  an  optical  phenomenon. The  implication is: before  the  proper formation of the concept  can take place, the phenomena themselves are endowed with a contour or delineation.
