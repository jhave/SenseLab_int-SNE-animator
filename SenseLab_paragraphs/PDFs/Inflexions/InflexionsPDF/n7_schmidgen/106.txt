[7]  Canguilhem  1955.  In  1977,  a  slightly   revised  and   enlarged version was published with  Vrin. In the following I will refer to this latter  version of the book as “FR” with  page  numbers and  place these  references in brackets in the body  of the text. Excerpts  from  this book were  published in English  in Canguilhem 2000:
179-187; 193-194. In  addition, one  may  note  that  Canguilhem has  published a short  article  on  the  reflex  concept  in the  19th  century in 1964. See Canguilhem
