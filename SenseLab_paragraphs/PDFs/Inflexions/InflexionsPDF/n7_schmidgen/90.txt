Now,  Canguilhem refers  to life in general within the  very  domain that  authors such   as  Ràdl,   Nordenskiöld  and   Singer   had   established  as  the   ‘history  of biology.’   That  is  the  striking  difference with   respect  to  Bergson,   Freud and Nietzsche. The consequence seems  to be that  Canguilhem enters  a vicious  circle. Should his ‘method’ not clearly be distinguished from his ‘object’? Should the historian and  philosopher not  distance himself  from  the life sciences  in order to better   understand  and   explain  these   sciences?   Canguilhem  answers  in  the negative. Instead he claims,  “The theory of life has  to have  its idea  of the living from  the  living”  (Canguilhem 2008a: xx). With  von  Weizsäcker, one  could  also say: “For studying the living, one has to participate in life” (von Weizsäcker 1958:
33).
