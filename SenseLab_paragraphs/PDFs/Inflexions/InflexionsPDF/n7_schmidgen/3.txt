Georges   Canguilhem only  rarely   expressed himself   programmatically  on  the history of science.  When  he  did  so, he  left  scarcely  any  doubt that  to  him  the history of science was above  all a history of concepts. In 1963, in a historical introduction to the physiology textbook of Charles Kayser,  he wrote:  “History of science cannot  be a simple  collection  of biographies and  even less a chronological chart   decorated  by  anecdotes.  It  also  has  to  be  a  history  of  the  formation, deformation and rectification of scientific concepts” (Canguilhem 2002c: 235). [1]
