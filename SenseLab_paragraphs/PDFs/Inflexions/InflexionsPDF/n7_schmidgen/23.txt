Read  with  an  eye  on  the  material culture of  scientific  practice, Canguilhem’s book  quickly  turns into a gallery  of acephals. A frog whose  brain  was  separated from  the  spinal  chord:  stimulation of its feet causes  it to contract;  a rabbit  body that  was decapitated: if artificial  respiration is applied it remains able to move  in various ways;  lizards without heads:  during several  days  they  remain able  to walk  and  even  to copulate. An entire  chapter is indeed devoted to “Decapitated Animals.” But elsewhere they  surface  too: decapitated and  decerebrated vipers, salamanders,  tortoises, chickens   and   dogs,   and   even  acephalous fetuses   that survived in their  mother’s uterus and  were  able  to move  their  limbs  even  after they were born.
