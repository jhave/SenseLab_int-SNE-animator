The  author of  the  reflex  book  is  surely   not  a  structuralist in  the  sense  of  de Saussure or Lévi-Strauss. Concepts are smaller and  more  mobile  entities  than structures, and  even  if they  display an interior stratification they  keep  a certain sedentariness and  palpability, especially when compared to the  complexities of the signifier/signified-relation. However, read  from  a historical perspective, the reflex book reconstructs an authentic structure of scholars contributing to the formation of the reflex concept.  These scholars cooperate almost  blindly with  one another over  time.  Most  of them  are not  contemporaries. And  still, what  one  of these scholars neglects,  might  be highlighted by another. They use different instruments and  tools,  but  pose  similar   questions. They  come  from  different countries, were  trained in different disciplines, and  still they  are connected – by means of a concept,  a problem.
