[1] This paper is a condensed, revised and  updated version of my introduction to the  German translation of  Canguilhemâ€™s  book  on  the  formation of  the  reflex concept  in the 17th  and  18th  centuries (Schmidgen 2008). An extended version of the present paper will appear in History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences. I would like   to   thank  Karl   Hall   (Central  European  University)  and   Travis   Gaug (Regensburg University) for  their  corrections of my  English.  Unless  otherwise stated all translations from the French  and the German are my own.
