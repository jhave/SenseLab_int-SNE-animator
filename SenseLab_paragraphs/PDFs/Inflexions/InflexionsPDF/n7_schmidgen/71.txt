The reason for this lack of explicitness lies in Descartes’s assumption that the centripetal and  the centrifugal mechanisms of sensori-motricity are essentially heterogeneous. Descartes conceived of the sensory stimulation as an authentic pulling  of  the   nerves,   whereas  he  understood  the  motor   reaction  as  being triggered by  the  transport of fluids  (esprits) through the  nerves  to  the  muscle. The first process  resembled the tolling  of a church bell, the second was similar  to blowing air  into  an  organ   pipe.   According  to  Canguilhem, this  asymmetric conception  of  sensori-motricity  also   explains  why   Descartes  uses   the   term “reflected”  only  once  in  his  physiological  texts.  It  is  a  word  suggesting an analogy that in Descartes’s physiology had no extended explanatory function.
