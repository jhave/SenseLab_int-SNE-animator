The  story   that   unfolds as  one  passes   through this  gallery   is  the  story   of  a Copernican   revolution   in   the   history  of   physiology.  Canguilhem’s   main argument is that  the concept  of reflex was  formed under the sign of “a negation of the cerebral  privilege in the realm  of the sensori-motricity” (FR 77). Until  the end  of the  18th  century, observations and  explanations concerning the physiological mechanism of involuntary  movements inscribed themselves into an  anthropocentric vision  of the  organism. This  vision  displayed some  striking similarities with  pre-Copernican cosmology: “The  heart  or the brain  were  taken to be the respective centers  of the animal body  around which  it turned. They corresponded to what  man,  in Ptolemaic astronomy, was  for the  stars  that  rose and  set with  respect to his earthly being,  to what  the King, in monarchical states, was  for his  obedient subjects.  The  Copernican Revolution in the  physiology of movement is the dissociation of the notions of the brain  and  of the sensori-motor center,  the discovery of eccentric  centers,  the formation of the reflex concept” (FR
127).
