In an  edited volume, Isabelle  Stengers has  explored the  trajectories of scientific concepts and,  together with  Judith   Schlanger, she  has  devoted a  book  length study to  the  peculiar “power” of these  concepts. Andrew  Pickering has  dealt with  conceptual practices in the “mangle-ish” history of mathematics. An entire volume concerning the historical and  epistemological aspects of the gene concept was  carefully compiled by  Peter  Beurton, Raphael Falk,  and  Hans-Jörg Rheinberger. And  Arnold Davidson has  investigated the  formation of concepts with  respect to the “emergence of sexuality.” [2] Over the last few years,  the publication of a number of dictionaries concerning the  language of the  sciences and  the history and  philosophy of science has underscored the importance of this perspective.
