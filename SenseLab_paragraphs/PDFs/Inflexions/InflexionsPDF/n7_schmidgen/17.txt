Drawing on earlier  texts by Canguilhem, e.g. the 1937 article “Descartes et la technique,” I show  that this discussion of the role of concepts involves theoretical assumptions concerning the  relation of science  and  technology, one  of Canguilhem’s   long   term    interests.  In   particular,  I   will   demonstrate  that Canguilhem argued in favor  of separating science  and  technology, while highlighting the biological  and  anthropological importance of technological activities. In this perspective, technology appears as an almost  natural element of scientific   practice.  However,  in   order  to   reach   the   specificity  of  scientific reasoning in  biology,  technology is  not  enough. According to  Canguilhem, it must  be left behind in order to fully grasp the nature of biological  phenomena.
