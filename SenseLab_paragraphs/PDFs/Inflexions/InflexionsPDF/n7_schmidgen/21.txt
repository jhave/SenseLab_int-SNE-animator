In the conclusion I try to characterize Canguilhem’s approach as a ‘biological structuralism.’ Similar  to phenomenologists such  as Merleau-Ponty, Canguilhem often referred to and  relied  on the tradition of general biology  (von Uexküll, Buytendijk, Goldstein, etc.). At the  same  time,  his  philosophical project  clearly differs  from  phenomenological approaches. To quote  Michel  Foucault’s famous genealogical  scheme,   Canguilhem  did   not   contribute  to   a  “philosophy  of experience, of sense,  and  of subject”  (Foucault 1989: 8). However, his notion of knowledge and  rationality remains tied  to a conception of life that  can  also  be found in Sigmund Freud, Friedrich Nietzsche, Henri  Bergson  and  others. According to this conception, life predominantly manifests itself in organic individuals that  act  and  react  within specific  environments which,  in turn,  are defined by the needs  and tendencies of these individuals.
