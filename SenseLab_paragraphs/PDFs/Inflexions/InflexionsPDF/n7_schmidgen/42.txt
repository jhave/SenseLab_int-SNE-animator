Despite the fact that Canguilhem occasionally quotes Ernst Kapp  and Alfred Espinas in this context,  he does not subscribe to the theory of organ  projection. The ‘entities’ that he relates  to the tools, machines, and other  technological devices  are not the ready made  organs of the human body,  but the “needs,” “desires,” and “manifestations of will” in a vital organism that responded to
