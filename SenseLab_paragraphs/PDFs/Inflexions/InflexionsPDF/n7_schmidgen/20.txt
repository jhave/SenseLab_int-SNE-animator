In a third step,  I attempt to reconstruct the theory of concepts that  underlies the reflex   book.   I  distinguish  three   aspects  in  Canguilhem’s   understanding  of concepts: their  stratification, their  function, and  the  process  of their  formation. Referring  to  earlier   publications  by  Canguilhem,  in  particular  the   Traité  de Logique et de Morale (1939), co-authored with  Camille  Planet,  and  his collection  of articles  “Knowledge of Life” (originally published as “La connaissance de la vie” in 1952) I show  that  his theory of the concept  is eventually grounded in biology, in  particular general biology.  [9] Following Goldstein, Jakob  von  Uexküll  and similar  biologists, Canguilhem argues that  human knowledge (connaissance) is a “general method for  the  direct  or  indirect resolution of tensions between man and  milieu” (Canguilhem 2008a: xviii). As we  will  see, this  argument provides the  larger  framework for  understanding the  vital  role  of concepts in  scientific practice.
