Two passages from  Descartes’s Passions de l’âme are normally referred to in their accounts: article  13, where Descartes describes movements that  are triggered, independently of the soul, by the effect of exterior objects on the sensory organs; and  article  36, where Descartes discusses the  processing of sensory impressions in the brain  as well as the resulting body  movements and  uses  the term  “esprits réflechis.” In the first passage, Descartes describes the involuntary shutting of the eye as a reaction to objects that  suddenly approach it. According to Canguilhem, this   is  “without  any   doubt  a  reflex”   (FR  42).  In  other   words,  the  thing   is appropriately described but the word is missing.
