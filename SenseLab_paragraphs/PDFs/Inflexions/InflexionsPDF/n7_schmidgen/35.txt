It is true that 19th-century laboratories of physiology were full of instruments and devices  for  exploring and  illustrating involuntary movements in  organisms or parts  of organisms: various stands and  fasteners for demonstrating the effects of decerebrations in  frogs  and  rabbits, devices  for  dissecting and  stimulating the spinal  chord,  du  Bois-Reymondâ€™s  contraction telegraphs and  frog  pistols,  and complex frames  for investigating the knee jerk in human test subjects  (Fig. 1).
