The option to separate the components of concepts from  one another and  to use them   independently  has  another aspect,   however. It  allows   the  scientists to
‘cultivate’  scientific   concepts  on  different  “theoretical  terrains”  (FR  6,  171).
Because  their  stratification concepts are “theoretically polyvalent” (FR 6), which makes  them  relatively independent of specific  theory territories. In the  mid-19th century, the concept  of reflex is certainly embedded in mechanist physiology. At this point,  it is almost  forgotten that  it has its origins  in the vitalist  thought of the
17th  and  18th  centuries. Only  toward the  beginning of the  20th  century does  the concept  of reflex become  ‘transplanted’ onto  other  theoretical grounds. Insofar  it is almost  literally the question of “conceptual filiations,” of different generations of concepts that  have  to be dated and  localized. In addition, Canguilhem’s genealogical study demonstrates that  the history of concepts has its own  kind  of “humor” (FR 171) – what  mechanists considered as an  crucial  element of their kind  of physiology turns out be invented by their worst  enemies, i.e. the vitalists.
