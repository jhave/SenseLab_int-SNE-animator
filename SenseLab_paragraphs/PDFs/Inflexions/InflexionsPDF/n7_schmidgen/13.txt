Given  the fact that  Canguilhem studied predominantly concepts of the biological and  biomedical sciences, and  given  the current role played by language in public discussions on  the  life  sciences,  Paul  Rabinow has  reminded us  how  fruitful these   studies are:  “Canguilhem  has  spent   his  life  tracing   the  liniments  of  a history of the  concepts of the  sciences  of life. Let us suggest today that  it is the biosciences – with  a renewed elaboration of such  concepts as  norms and  life, death and  information – that  hold  center  stage  in the scientific  and  social arena; hence the renewed relevance of Canguilhem“ (Rabinow 2000: 19).
