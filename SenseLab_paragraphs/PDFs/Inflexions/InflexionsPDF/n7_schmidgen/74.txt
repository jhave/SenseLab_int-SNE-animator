However, if the  history (Geschichte) of concepts seriously takes  into  account the stratification (Schichtung) of concepts, it will be confronted with  rather complex relations. A certain  word can be used,  the thing  in question can be described, but a definition is lacking.  Or: the thing  is described and  appropriately defined, but the   word  is   missing.  Precisely    such   relations  cause   the   difficulties and misunderstandings in identifying the originator of a concept.  According to Canguilhem, those  historians of physiology who  have  identified Descartes as the originator of the reflex concept  mistook a description for a definition and  a word for  a  concept.   Following du  Bois-Reymond, they  have  treated the  concept   of reflex  as a merely textual element that  only  served one  purpose: to establish an immediate connection between their  mechanist present and  the  mechanist past. The result  is not providing an account of history, but telling  a legend (FR 36-37).
