What is at stake here is not simply pragmatism, however. Canguilhem’s remarks about  the interplay of concept  and instrument are connected to a topic that he was interested in and dealt  with since the late 1930s, i.e. the relation between technology and science. [11] Following Bergson’s theory of homo faber and partly responding to discussions between members of the Frankfurt School concerning the social origins  of mechanist philosophy, Canguilhem argued against the view that technology is a mere result  of applied science. In his eyes, technological practice, initially,  is independent of scientific action. Technology represents a kind of primary mode  in which  humans respond to and intervene creatively in their milieu.  [12] Ultimately, tools and machines are “organs” of the human
body.  As Hacking has put it in his Canguilhem cyborg  essay, tools and machines are “extensions of life, of vitality, of living,” (Hacking 1998: 207, emphasis in the original) i.e. they broaden and intensify life, but may also threaten and endanger it.
