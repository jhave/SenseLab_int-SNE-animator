The peculiarity of this physiological revolution lies in the fact that,  in contrast to astronomy, it is not  linked  to a single  name.  And  it did  not  happen in a short period of time.  The concept  of reflex  took  more  than  150 years  to become  a fact (see  FR 169). Thomas Willis  made   the  first  step  in  the  last  third of  the  17th century. In contrast to Descartes, Willis assumed a basic symmetry between the centripetal and  centrifugal process  of sensori-motricity. Hence  he was capable  of conceiving  the   relation  between  sensation  and   movements  as  similar   to  a reflection, a  reflux,  or  an  echo.  In  addition, Willis  was  the  first  to  attempt to localize  voluntary and  involuntary movements with  respect to their  anatomical basis, by distinguishing the structures of brain  and cerebellum.
