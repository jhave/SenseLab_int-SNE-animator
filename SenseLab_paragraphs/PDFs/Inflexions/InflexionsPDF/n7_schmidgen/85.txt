Life, insofar  it is movement, resembles light for Willis, or more  precisely fire, and for that  reason he recognizes in the laws  of light  and  fire an “archetype” (FR 72) for the  laws  of life. As a consequence, his  physiology extends into  a chemistry and   energetics  of  the   living   body,   whereas  Descartes  remains  within  the framework of elementary mechanics. The  analogies preferred by  Descartes are the lever,  the winch,  the tackle  block, the clockwork, the organ  and  the fountain system   in  the  garden of  Saint-Germain en  Laye.  In  other   words, it  is  also  a specific  material culture that  prevented him  from  formulating the  concept   of reflex.
