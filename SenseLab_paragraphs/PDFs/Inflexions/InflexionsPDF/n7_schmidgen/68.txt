Canguilhem conceives  of concepts as complex entities  consisting of three components:  a  phenomenon, a  denomination, and  a  definition, or:  a  thing,   a word, and  an explanatory sentence. In the reflex book,  the existence  of these components is largely  derived from  the  critical  discussion of the  argument that Descartes is the originator of the physiological reflex concept.  Following du Bois- Reymond, this  argument was  taken  up  and  developed, in one way  or the other, in historical and  systematic accounts by authors such  as Henri  Milne-Edwards (1878), Conrad Eckhard (1881), Mieczyslaw Minkowski (1924) as well as Hebbel E. Hoff and Peter Kellaway (1952).
