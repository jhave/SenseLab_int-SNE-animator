This line of argument paves  the way for Canguilhem’s redefinition of “vitalism” in the reflex book. He no longer  identifies vitalism with specific topics or themes (“vital force,” “vis vitalis,”  “vis insita,” etc.), but describes it as an epistemological attitude in biological  research. For him, vitalists are not “metaphysical thinkers,” but rather “cautious positivists” (FR 113), not least because they envision the interrelations between technology, science, and life
from a specific angle: “[E]very  attempt to reduce organic functions to mechanical systems simply neglects  the fact that this is not the ultimate form of knowledge
in this area. Perhaps vitalism is merely the presentiment of an ontological, i.e., chronologically irreducible anticipation of knowledge with respect to mechanical theory and technology, intelligence and the simulation of life” (FR 122). Put differently: mechanist physiology did not leave technology behind, which, according to Canguilhem, is necessary in order to reach scientific concepts that are appropriate for the object of biology,  i.e. life. In other  words, even in laboratory-based biology  it is not sufficient to turn  concepts, by means  of machines, into percepts.
