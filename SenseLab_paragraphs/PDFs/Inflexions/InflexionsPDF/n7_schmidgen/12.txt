In   his   studies  on   the   history  and   philosophy  of   medicine  and   biology, Canguilhem responded  in  numerous  ways   to  his  programmatic  statements. Already his first book,  the  1943 Essay on some problems concerning the normal and the  pathological, comprises a  section   focusing on  the  “Critical   Examination  of Certain  Concepts”,  i.e.  “The   Normal,”  “Anomaly  and   Disease,”  and   “The Normal and  the Experimental.” In the following years, he devoted articles  to investigate  concepts  such   as  “Cell,”   “Milieu,”  “Development”  and/or “Evolution,” “Method,” “Life,”  “Regulation,” and  “Health.” [5] Even  in studies that  have  a different focus one finds  detailed considerations concerning the etymology, history and  use of biological  and  medical concepts, e.g., in his articles on “Monstrosity and  the Monstrous” and  “The Physiology and  Pathology of the Thyroid in the 19th century.” [6]
