example  in   the   introduction  to   Difference  and   Repetition,   when  crediting empiricism for the  “most  insane  creation of concepts ever  been  seen  or heard” (Deleuze 1994: xx), or in a dialogue with  the  Polish  artist  Stephane Czerkinsky when stating that  concepts “are  things, peoples, zones,  regions, thresholds, gradients, temperatures, speeds, etc.” (Deleuze 2004: 312). In What Is Philosophy?, Deleuze argues and  Guattari argue  that  the  true  object  of science  is to  create functions;  the  object  of  art  to  bring   forth   sensorial  aggregates;  and   that   of philosophy to  invent or  create  concepts (Deleuze and  Guattari 1994: 201-217). The  present paper contributes to  questioning the  sharpness of this  distinction. With  Canguilhem in mind, Deleuze’s  claim  about  the  philosophical creation of concepts can be understood as resulting from  a strategic replacement of science through philosophy. I further discuss this issue in my paper “Cerebral Drawings between  Art   and   Science:  Gilles  Deleuze’s   Philosophy  of  Concepts”,  to  be published in Theory, Culture & Society.
