Living  beings  isolate  in their  milieu  features that  they  are  interested in, and  in this  sense  they  already judge  and  abstract, they  form  concepts even  before  they think  consciously. According to Bergson,  this  holds  also true  for human beings. Initially,  they live and  perceive the general more  than  they think  it. Even without consciousness explicitly  involved man  is capable  of subducting similarities from various objects, so that  these  objects can be grouped and  handled in a quasi- conceptual way. Bergson  adds, the general concept  that  is created in this manner relies  “more  on  automatic reactions than  it is proper thought” (Bergson  1959:
1296). In this sense, one could  perhaps even say that the concept  is a reflex before the reflex is a concept.
