Highlighting the  cultural presence of the  reflex  concept  in 1950s France  should not block from view the academic publications that Canguilhem could  use “like a microtome” for  his  study. In  the  first  place,  one  has  to  mention here  Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s La structure du comportement (1942). In this book, Merleau-Ponty provides an extended criticism  of mechanist reflexology, of traditional localizationism and  of learning theories purely based  on associationism. He also deploys  the   basic   features  of  the   “vitalist”  conception  of  the   reflex   that Canguilhem departed from  in his historical analysis. Following Sherrington, Merleau-Ponty  argues,  for   example,  that   even   reflexes   involve  the   entire organism. In addition, his section  on “Reflex Behavior” quotes a number of contemporary reflex  scholars that  Canguilhem equally relies  on, e.g. Viktor  von Weizsäcker, Frederik Buytendijk, and  above  all Kurt  Goldstein (Merleau-Ponty
1963: especially 7-51).
