Although the  reflex  book  does  not  contain an  explicit  theory of  concepts, its historical analysis allows   for  a  reconstruction of  the  basic  features of  such  a theory. Canguilhemâ€™s study of concepts is concerned with  three  aspects:  first, the stratification  of  concepts;  second,  their   function; third,  the   process   of  their formation.
