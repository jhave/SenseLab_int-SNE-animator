In 1950s France, the reflex has turned into a “fact of public  utility  and general knowledge,” says Canguilhem, and he adds:  “Insofar as his work  or his way of life depends on it, everyone knows today or would like to know  if he has good reflexes or bad ones” (FR 163). This state of affairs is not only caused by the fact that examining reflexes had become  a routine in medical hospitals and practices. Around 1950, the reflex in that sense was complemented, perhaps even out-dated by a generalized understanding of “reflexes.” According to Canguilhem, the cultural preference for the ideals  of industrial civilization was decisive in this regard. This civilization demands and supports reflex reactions, in particular in interactions with machines. Applied psychologists (“psychotechniciens”) and engineers aim at “adapting the velocity  and uniformity of movements – decomposed into elementary gestures in ever more efficient ways – to the functioning of machines and the earnings of big companies” (FR 165-6).
