In the following, Canguilhem does  not dispute the fact that  the word “reflected” is used  in  the  second passage. Rather,  he  argues that  it concerns a pattern of behavior that is much  more  complex than  any reflex action. What  is missing then is the  link  between thing  and  word, i.e. a definition. Canguilhem underscores that  he  is  not  trying to  ask  a  17th-century philosopher  and  physiologist for  a definition of mathematical precision. His  point  is that  Descartes does  not  offer any  explanatory sentence apt  to fix the  “sense” of the  phenomenon in question (see FR 30-42).
