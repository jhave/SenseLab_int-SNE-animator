Precisely  this is what  Canguilhem says in his article  on the reflex concept  in the
19th  century: “Within the kind  (genre) of movements the concept  of reflex circumscribes a specific  species  (espèce)” (Canguilhem 2002e: 295). It is as if the manifestations of life themselves come  toward the  formation of concepts. The rough sketch  that Willis used  to structure his perceptions can build  on the formal organization embodied in biological  phenomena. In “Le concept  et la vie,” Canguilhem speaks, in this connection, of the “invitation of life to the conceptualization of life by man”  (Canguilhem 2002f: 352).
