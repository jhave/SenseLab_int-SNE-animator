“Eventually a library  annexed to a laboratory is divided into two departments: a museum and a work  shop.  There are books that you leaf through like you contemplate a stone ax. There are others  that you open  like you use a microtome. But where is the border-line between the museum and the work  shop?  Who traces it? And when does it move?”  (FR 156) The library  that Canguilhem alludes to is the library  of the physiological institute in Strasbourg. Large parts  of the reflex book were written in this library  (Fig. 2). What Canguilhem once noted with respect to physiologist Johannes Müller  and his home  town  Koblenz  might also be said about  this library  and the city of Strasbourg: To someone faced with
quickly  shifting political  and linguistic borders it is sometimes enough “to stay in place in order to become  cosmopolitan” (Canguilhem 2002c: 248-249).
