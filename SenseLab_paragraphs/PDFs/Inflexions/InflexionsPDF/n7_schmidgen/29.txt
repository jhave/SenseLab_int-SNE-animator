One  of the  surprising features of Canguilhem’s  historiography of the  reflex  is that  it does  not go beyond 1800. As well-known, the experimental physiology of the  reflex  only  started in the  first  half  of the  19th  century, with  the  research on reflex  actions  conducted by Marshall Hall  and  Johannes Müller  in 1832/33 and the  first  scheme   of  the  reflex  arc  devised by  Rudolf   Wagner in  1844.  What Canguilhem offers, then,  seems  to be a pre-history of the reflex concept,  perhaps even just a history of the pre-scientific reflex concept.
