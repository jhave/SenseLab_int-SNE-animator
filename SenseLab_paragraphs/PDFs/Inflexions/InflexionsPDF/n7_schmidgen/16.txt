The  present paper  takes   Canguilhem’s  book   on  the  formation  of  the  reflex concept  as a starting point  for  reconstructing the  basic  ideas  of his  conceptual history of science. First, I will introduce the book by summarizing its central argument. According to Canguilhem it was  not  René  Descartes but  the  English physician and  natural philosopher Thomas Willis who  created the physiological reflex concept.  At the same  time, I will discuss the context  in which  Canguilhem embeds  this   argument,  i.e.  the   continuing debate between mechanism and vitalism. In this  connection, Canguilhem depicts concepts as laboratory ‘actors’ that, tied to scientific  instruments and  other  such devices,  are able to produce perceptions – a feature that,  however, does  not  anticipate the  scientific  value  of the concepts in question, as we will see later.
