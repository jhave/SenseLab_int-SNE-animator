Another text can be named that  Canguilhem could  directly use for his study: the two lectures on “Réflexes  et comportement” published by the director of the Strasbourg physiology institute, Charles Kayser,  in 1947. Kayser  introduces his topic  by  way  of an  historical overview that,  according to  Canguilhem, is “the best”  (FR 154) that  was  published by  a physiologist in  the  20th   century. (This judgment is not entirely neutral, since Kayser  credits  Canguilhem for his help  in conducting historical research at the end  of his second lecture.)  In the systematic part  of his  lectures, Kayser  mentions Merleau-Ponty and  refers  to the  scientific work  of scholars such  as von  Uexküll  and  von  Weizsäcker. As has already been noted, Canguilhem repeatedly relies  on these  authors in the  reflex  book  as well as in Knowledge of Life.
