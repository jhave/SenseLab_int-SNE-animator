In  the  Traité de Logique et de Morale, Canguilhem speaks of the  concept  as  the “enunciation of a problem to be solved.” Concepts are “waiting positions” on the road   to  more   precise   knowledge  (Canguilhem  and   Planet   1939:  94).  These remarks   suggest   that    the    conceptual   identification   and    classification   of experiences  does   not   proceed  arbitrarily  or   at   random.  In  fact,  the   Traité underscores in a rather Bergsonian manner that,  taken  as such,  “concepts cannot be  truths.”  Rather,   they   “suggest  problems”  (Ibid:   96).  Concepts  mark   or designate questions. They  may  hint  at  first  answers, but  these  will  always be object to examination and revision.
