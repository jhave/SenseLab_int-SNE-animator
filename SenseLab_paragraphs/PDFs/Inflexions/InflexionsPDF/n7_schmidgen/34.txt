How  could  the mechanist conception of reflex action  become  so predominant in the  19th  century that  it resulted, among other  things, in a distortion of the  past? Canguilhem’s answer brings  technology into  play:  “Around 1800 the concept  of reflex is without any  doubt a ‘good’ concept,  but  it is not yet good  for anything. It  is  discussed, but  one  knows nothing about   it,  because one  does  not  make something out  of it. It is only  inscribed into  the  books.  In 1850, the  concept  of reflex  is inscribed into  the books  and  the laboratory, in form  of exploration and demonstration apparatuses that  are  assembled for  it,  that  would not  be  there without it. The reflex ceases to be a mere concept  in order to become  a percept. It exists  because it  gives  existence  to  objects  that  it  makes  understandable” (FR
