Another striking feature of his historiography is the  following: save  for Astruc, all  the  historical  actors   mentioned  by  Canguilhem  are  usually  regarded  as vitalists. In the  19th  century, however, the  reflex  was  considered a basic  fact of mechanist physiology, an achievement of “organic physics.” Within  this context, some  mechanist physiologists, most  prominently Emil du  Bois-Reymond (1818-
1896), became  interested in the history of the reflex concept.  In their  publications on  the  topic   the  contributions  of  scholars  such   as  Unzer   and   Prochaska,  if mentioned at all, are considered to be extremely poor.  Since they “were” vitalists, they  could  not – per definitionem as it were  – contribute productively to the investigation of reflex phenomena. In other  words, a certain  kind  of “logic”  (the reflex   is   a   mechanical  phenomenon,   hence    only   mechanists  could    have contributed to its explanation) inspired a specific kind  of “history” (see FR 5).
