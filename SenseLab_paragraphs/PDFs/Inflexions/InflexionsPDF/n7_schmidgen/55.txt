After Walter’s demonstration, a French  journalist reported enthusiastically in the popular Larousse mensuel that the artificial  tortoises learned without any
difficulty to react “in a reflex-like  manner” to a specific whistling tone of a pipe. Shortly  later, popular books were published showing photographs of the conditioned tortoises that populated Walter’s living room and participated in his family life. Special issues  of journals such as Esprit, La Pensée, and La Nouvelle Revue Française discussed the perspectives and consequences implied in the emergence of such reflex machines.
