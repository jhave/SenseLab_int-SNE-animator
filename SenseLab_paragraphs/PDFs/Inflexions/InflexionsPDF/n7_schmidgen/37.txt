In   this   connection,  Canguilhem   quotes   Paul   Valéry   who,    in   his Introduction à la méthode de Léonard de Vinci, argues that a theory proves itself only “by   virtue  of   its   theoretical  and   experimental  deployment”  (see   FR  74). Canguilhem  himself   says   elsewhere  that   “the   theoretical  efficiency   or   the cognitive value   of  a  concept”  lies  in  the  possibilities that  it  creates   for  “the
development and progression of knowledge” (Canguilhem 2002f: 360).
