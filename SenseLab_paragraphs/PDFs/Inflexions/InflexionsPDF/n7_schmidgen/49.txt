In 1885, the Strasbourg institute was founded by the Germans, the founding director being Friedrich Goltz; in 1918 the institute was re-appropriated by the French; the Nazis  took hold of it in 1940; in 1945 Charles Kayser was reinstated as director of the institute – and its library.  [13] Even today, many  of the historical texts that Canguilhem quotes and references in the reflex book can be found in this library,  e.g. Georg Prochaska’s Lehrsätze aus der Physiologie des Menschen (1797), Robert Whytt’s Essay on the Vital and other Involuntary Motions of Animals (1751) and, of course,  Müller’s  Handbuch der Physiologie des Menschen (1833/40).
