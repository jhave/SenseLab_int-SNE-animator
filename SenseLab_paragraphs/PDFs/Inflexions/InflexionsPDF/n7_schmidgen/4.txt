Here,   it  still   might   seem   as  if  it  was   only   a  question  of  complementing contemporary  history  of  science   as  it  was   established  in  the   early   1960s. Elsewhere Canguilhem made  clear  that,  in fact, he meant its replacement. That same  year, in an article on Gaston  Bachelard, he called for a “new  art” of writing the   history  of  science:   “This   history  cannot   any   longer   be  a  collection   of biographies or a chart  of doctrines in the manner of natural history. It has to be a history of conceptual filiations” (Canguilhem 2002b: 184).
