Even the young Foucault was impressed by the “reflex 1950,” albeit in a slightly different manner. In 1954, in his first book Maladie mentale et personnalité, he writes  affirmatively about  Pavlovian reflex theory. In his eyes, this theory provided the basis for a “holistic” psychiatry firmly grounded in Marxism (Foucault 1954: 109).
