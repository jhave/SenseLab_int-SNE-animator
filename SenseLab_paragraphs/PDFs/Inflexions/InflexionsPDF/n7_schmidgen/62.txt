The French  translation of Goldstein’s Der Aufbau des Organismus (1934) was published in 1951. This book contains an extended presentation and discussion of reflex   phenomena,  as   Canguilhem  explicitly    notes   (FR  164).  Against  the background  of  clinical   and   experimental  findings,  Goldstein  criticizes   the “doctrine of the  reflex  structure of the  organism” and  repeatedly questions the current concept  of reflex.  According to Goldstein, it is impossible to “directly” observe the phenomena that  correspond to “the  strict reflex concept.” According to  him,  these   phenomena are  a  result   of  “extremely  artificial” experimental situations. Goldstein even  goes  so far as to claim  that  the  mechanist concept  of reflex  is almost  “completely” preventing the  progression of research (Goldstein
1995: 78 and 82).
