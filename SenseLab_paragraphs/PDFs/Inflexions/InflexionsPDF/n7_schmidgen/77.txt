The main  function that  Canguilhem attributes to the concept  formed by Willis is the following: it provides “the possibility of a judgment” (FR 69). The initial form that   this   judgment   takes   is  an   “identification  and   classification”  (ibid.)   of experiences. In  other   words,  concepts initially   ‘do’  nothing else  than discriminating and  circumscribing specific  sensations and  perceptions. Coupled to  instruments and  devices,  the  mid-19th-century concept  of reflex  was  able  to produce percepts; in the  17th  century, however, percepts led  to the  construction of   concepts   or,   more    precisely:   the   active    delineation   and    ordering  of observations prepared  the  formation of  a  concept.   When   it  was  formed the concept  could  perhaps be understood as a scheme,  a rough sketch  that  was  able to direct  us toward and  focus our attention on certain  phenomena. In the context of science,  the  initial  roughness of the  drawing is not  simply a disadvantage. It also  is the  potential for further developments, for increasing the  clarification of the phenomenon in question.
