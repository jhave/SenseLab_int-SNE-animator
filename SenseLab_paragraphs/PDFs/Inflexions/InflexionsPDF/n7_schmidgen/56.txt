In 1954, psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan made  reference to Walter’s tortoises in his seminar in order to update his theory of the imaginary (Lacan 1991: 51-52). In a striking experiment, Walter  had placed one of his turtle robots  in front of a mirror. The light beam emitted by the robot that, in combination with a light-
sensitive receptor, served the purpose of orientation was reflected and caused the turtle to react to its own image  – an effect evocative to the “mirror stadium” of
the human infant  described by Lacan.
