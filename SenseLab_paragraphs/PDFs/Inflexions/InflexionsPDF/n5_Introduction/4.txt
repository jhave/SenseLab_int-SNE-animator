Simondonâ€™s   constructive   and    operational   grasp   radically  transforms   the traditional teleological, structural and  functional approach to technology by recentering the problem within an operational and  relational approach. Whereas a functional approach emphasizes structures after  their  process of formation as well  as their  corresponding functionings, an operational undertaking privileges the formative processes at play  in the genesis  of forms.  Emerging forms,  by this account, cannot be deduced from  pre-given forms.  In other  words, technological functionings cannot be explained by the forms to which  they are related, and conversel y.  A  functioning  is  an  effect  rather  than   a  correspondence  or  an explanation.  Simondon  argues  for   the   becoming  of   technical  objects   and
individuals  to  be  understood  in  terms   of  a  concretization  or  individuation
