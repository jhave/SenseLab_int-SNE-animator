emerging  from   a   preindividual  field   of   relation.  The   technical  object   or individual is  not  a  concretization in  the  sense  that  it  instantiates an  abstract object. Rather,  it is a novel  emergence from  the preindividual, whose  tensions it resolves in  its  mode   of  being.  In  the  process, it  potentializes an  “associated milieu,”  which   acts  as  a  connective  force   maintaining  the   solidarity  of  its subsequent operations as a constituted being.
