While   it  is  the   technical  object   that   Simondon  privileges  in  his   work,   he conceptualizes it as an allagmatic theory:  a theory of operations. The operations in question do not  only  reside  in the individuation of the  technical object. Their interlinkages connect  all aspects of human endeavour. Simondon guides us  in thinking through how  an  isomorphism between operational relations between domains of emergence – as opposed to structural relations between constituted forms – valorizes the objective  conditions of a processual and  relational approach to the becoming of technique. This is how  energetic milieus are entangled in processes of potentialization that  improvise connections and  carry  implicit forms/virtual motifs.  What  we  see as a “work of art”  then,  is a snapshot of an intensive and  ongoing process of concretization and  individuation. We are thus far removed from the traditional domain of representational art.
