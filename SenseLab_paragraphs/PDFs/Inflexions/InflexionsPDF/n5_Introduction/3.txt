Gilbert Simondon: Milieus, Techniques, Aesthetics is intended as a precursor to the forthcoming English  translations of  his  work  on  technical objects  and individuation. We seek to elicit the necessary tools to think  through his creative approach  to   the   relationship  between  the   becoming  of  technology,  living organisms and  aesthetics with  respect to material and  lived  intensities. While Simondonâ€™s oeuvre tends towards a philosophy of technical objects and individuation, its relevance to artistic  practice or aesthetics in action have  yet to be fully explored.
