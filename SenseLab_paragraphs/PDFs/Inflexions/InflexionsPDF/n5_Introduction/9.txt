Simondonâ€™s contribution is perhaps best  actualized in works  of art  that  emerge within the  intertwining  of  sciences  and   technolog y.  We  have  invited artists, practitioners and   thinkers to  present  rigorous contributions to  the  region   of practices that  straddle technoscientific investigation and  creation. In each  of the papers presented in  this  issue,  the  work   is  in  the  potential individuation  as revealed  through   an   action:    an   active    artistic    engagement  through   the questioning of material concretization. These investigations are potentialized patterns  and   motifs   of  aesthetic  engagement:   a  cycle,  if  you   will,   of  pre- individuated with  the individuated, of the abstract with  the concrete. It is in the discourse that  is  presented here,  we  hope,   that  both  the  terms   aesthetic and technique  have   the   possibility  of  a  radical  redistribution  of  meaning  as  is suggested in his term the techno-aesthetic.
