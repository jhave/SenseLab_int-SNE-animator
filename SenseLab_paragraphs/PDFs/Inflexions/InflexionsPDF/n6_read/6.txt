will be looking  at here.  I will do  this  through a broadly phenomenological lens and  in particular through the relation of intentionality on which  phenomenology is founded. This  relation is that  of the  subjectâ€™s  relation with  the  object,  or the body  with  the  world (Sartre  1992: 387-391). There  are  several  consequences of this starting position I will expand in this paper, the chief of which  is the fact we have  to consider the orders of the subject-object relation as finite and  constructed in  the  relationship itself.  This  opens  a way  to  understanding the  ways  we  are locked,   as  a  consequence  of  our  status as  finite,  historical and   technological creatures, into a structure which  is at the same  time enabling and  constraining. It also raises  some questions about  the way Arakawa and  Gins understand the bio- tech or body-surround relation.
