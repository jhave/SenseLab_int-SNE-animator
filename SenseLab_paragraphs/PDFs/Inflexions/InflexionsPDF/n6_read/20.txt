It is not the universe or its space  with  which  we comply in our everyday activity and  attention (Gins  and  Arakawa 2002: xiii);  it  is  precisely this  universe we bracket  out to know  and  to act. When  we are most alert and  focussed, that which gets  bracketed out  of attention increases rather than  decreases, and  we  act  by virtue of our  finitude and  situation rather than  despite it. The ‘world’ in which we  act  is a  world drawn in  and  remade for  action.  It  is remade in  an  active relation between subject and  object that  is also an ongoing work of technique and material organisation. There  is a basic  publicness about  this  which  is not  about our  being  subject  to  absolute or  even  human values  if we  see  this  ‘human’  as some  sort  of disembodied essence  (the  ideal  of ‘Man’  for  example), but  rather about   the  situated,  historical and   contingent  condition  of  being   and   acting between others,  and  between the things and  their  significances we construct and share  with others.[1]
