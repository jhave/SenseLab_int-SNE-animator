I will argue  that  it is through these  more  public  procedures, which  is also to say through techniques, that  we inhabit our  surrounds; it is through techniques that we  find  our  selves  and  inhabit worlds. This self-possession is never  something we simply have,  but is itself an attainment in space and  time. And  surrounds are not  simply that  against or within which  the  body  acts; they  are  active  parts  of this attainment of self, encompassing and  embodying what  we know  and  do and what  we could  possibly know  and  do within those  surrounds. The possession of a body  or a ‘world’ by a body  stands on no absolute or pre-existing ground; nor is there  any pre-existing space  or time as a foundation for possession. Possession
– which  is also to say existence  or being – involves the establishment of spaces  and times  in activities of possession, and  one of the ways  of opening this question is to ask: what  are these spaces  and times we are talking of?
