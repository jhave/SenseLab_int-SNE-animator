The spatiality of this is important: beyond the ‘thinking subject’ there  is another way to parse  the universe – no longer  into the abstract and  segregated categories of ‘natural,’  ‘human,’  ‘technological,’  ‘economic,’  ‘social’  or  whatever, but  into
‘spaces’ as ‘spherological’ material-organisational realms, each of which  operates as a ‘world’ with  its own  rationales and  principles of organisation. We begin  to see the outline of another order in which  ‘subject’ merges with  ‘object,’ ‘bio’ with
‘tech,’ ‘theory’ with  ‘practice,’ in synthetic and  prepared organisational ‘spaces’ and  settings that  themselves establish the boundings of the orders. What  a phenomenology filtered through Heidegger and  Heelan gives  us in the end  is a practical-equipmental and  techno-relational inhabitation of the world by way  of prepared  and   maintained  spaces   and   settings  for  regular  practice  and   the humans committed to the care of these.
