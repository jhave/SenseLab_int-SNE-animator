In  order to  expand  on  the  nature of  this  technology  I  will  first  review an argument from  the  philosophy of science  to demonstrate how  both  subject  and equipment are  essential parts  of a technological ‘construction  of reality.’  What will  turn   out  to  be  crucial   is  the  way  intention or  meaning is  ‘shifted’  into material  stuff   understood  as   ‘equipment.’   This   involves  an   historical and proactive relationship between subject  and  object and  also implies ‘space’ – the subject  and  the objects that  subject  is involved with  are related through ‘spaces’ which  are  human and technological constructions.  These  ‘spaces’  are  synthetic and   support  what   we   could,   following  Karin   Knorr   Cetina,   call  ‘synthetic situations’ (Knorr  Cetina  2009: 61-86). I will then  take  scientific  experimentation as a specialised account of human practice to show  eventually how  ‘spaces’ we could  see as forming more  everyday settings or surrounds are structured around different practices and their rationales or senses.
