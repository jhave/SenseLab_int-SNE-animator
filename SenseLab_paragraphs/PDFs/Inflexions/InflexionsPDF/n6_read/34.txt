Patrick   Heelan  has   argued  that   experimental  science   as   it  is  practised  is essentially hermeneutical, incorporating, as he puts  it, a “hermeneutical shift”, or the  displacement of the  “cut”  between the  subject  and  the  object  as part  of its practical method  (Heelan 1977: 11). He  adopts what   Don  Ihde  has  called  an
‘expanded’   or   ‘material’   hermeneutics  which   operates  at   this   crossing  of subjective and  objective,  or theoretical and  empirical realms. It refuses  strong distinctions between human and  natural sciences,  founding all knowledge in a human  ontology in  which   knowledge is  a  product of  manipulation and interpretation. The practice of science  needs  to be understood first, according to Heelan, from  a point  of view  given  in the  subject’s lifeworld and  in relation to the  active  intervention of the  subject  in the  activity  of experimentation.[4] This subject  brings  to the  table  sets of intentions and  expectations and  the  skills  and ability  to  manipulate material stuff  in  ways  which  shift  intentional structures into it (Heelan, 1977:25).
