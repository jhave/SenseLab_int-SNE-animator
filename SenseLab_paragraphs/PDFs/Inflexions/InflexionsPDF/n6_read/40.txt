An expanded hermeneutics therefore involves us in successive  theoretical  and   material  displacements  as  new   or   more   refined spheres of theory and  meaning are  embodied in new  or more  refined material arrangements and  apparatus. While the meaning-field of the lifeworld is refined and  transformed by theorising – whose  practical nature needs  to be understood in terms  of an expanded hermeneutics – it is also transformed through the ways new   technological  praxes   (including  instrumentation)  embody  new   theories (Heelan 1998: 176-177).
