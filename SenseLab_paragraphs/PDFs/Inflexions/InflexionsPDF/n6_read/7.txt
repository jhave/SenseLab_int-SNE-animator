We have  moved on  from  imagining ourselves as Cartesian ‘thinking  subjects,’ free to know  ourselves and  other  things from outside our emplacements and embodiments in a finite and  real world. We have  become  finite ‘knowing bodies’ knowing and  doing  what  we know  and  do  from  within finite  surrounds which are themselves extensions of ourselves. It is not the body  any  longer  that  knows and   acts  but   the  body   in  its  integral  relation  with   its  surround.  We  have necessarily de-naturalised  and   technologised  this  ‘body’  –  taken   it  out  of  a universe  of  natural  things and   forces  –  and   made   it  subject   of  and   to  the technique, and  material, of architecture. The world or worlds in which  we act are no longer  natural worlds, but particular and  located  answers to questions of how to live and act.
