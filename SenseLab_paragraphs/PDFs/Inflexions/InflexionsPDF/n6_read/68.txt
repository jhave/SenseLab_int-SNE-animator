Phenomenology also  begins  from  the  body-surround or  subject-object  relation. However, research in this tradition points to the way body  and  surround are not opposed but  merge  and  act together. Surround has to be understood in terms  of the technological spaces  that draw body  and surround into configurations so that action   becomes   directional  breaking  out   of  rather  than   being   contained  in surround. The  surround stands not  in opposition to the  body  but  incorporates intentional structures – it becomes  non-objective  – in  its  relation to  that  body. Body-surround act together in object-subject-practice complexes, and what  I have added here  is  a  proposal as  to  how  we  can  understand these  complexes as
‘technological spaces.’  The ‘extended’ hermeneutic is of a being  between things in which  objects  and  subjects  are  formed together and  in practice. In place  of a hermeneutic of subject  reading object, we have  subject-object-practice complexes or spaces in which  subject and object are formed and act together.
