simultaneously material and  meaningful. 17th Century Amsterdam provides another pertinent example because the network of urban canals  and  warehouses was   complimented  by  another  network  –  of  cities   strung  together  around shipping routes and  ports  along  with  the practices, bureaucracies and  standards of exchange and  trade that  made  the  rationales and  business of trade possible between them.  And then these two ‘worlds’ were hinged together in the harbour. The   harbour  was   where  most   of  the   activity   was   –  at   the   interface and articulation between the intra-city infrastructure of goods  transport and  an inter- city system  of trade and  exchange. We see a clear demonstration of how  spaces define  practical orders and  rationalities but  do  not  prevent us  from  traversing between spaces.  We move  into  and  out  of and  between ‘worlds’ and  in fact it is at the articulations of different ‘worlds’ that  valued places  appear around which further developments are accumulated.
