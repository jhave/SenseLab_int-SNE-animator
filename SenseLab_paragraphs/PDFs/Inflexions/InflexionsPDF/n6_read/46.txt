It is also material organisation: none  of this is simply abstract or belief; all this is built  into  hardware, organisational structures and  practices. All  of it  includes embodiment  in   buildings  and    infrastructures,   staff,   protocols,   schedules, practices, bureaucracies and  budgets. Organisational structures and  bounds are embodied in material-organisational constructions, where they  are developed, maintained  and   adjusted  by  communities  that   are  themselves  nested.  They structure relationships between different elements within constructions as well as relationships between constructions, so that  the  bounded constructions of experiment, lab and institute also have regularised relations with each other.
