We can begin  to see how  technologies, or ‘infrastructures,’ as I will use the word here,   are   technical networks  arranging  and   distributing  places,   things and practices that  have  and  draw their  significance in relation to one another. Whole arrangements of  subjects,  objects  and  practices work  together around infrastructures to construct larger  normative and  political geographical entities  – like  neighbourhoods or  cities  or  regions or  nations. These  are  arrangements realised   in   specific    historical   times    and    conditions   and    to   the    social- organisational and  technological state  of the art of their  times  and  places.  Ships, camel trains,  railways, tram,  metro  and  highway systems – but also the streets  of neighbourhoods – have  all played major roles in establishing the normalised and named spaces  through which  we understand our political  geographies today. Catalogues, room  allocations and  class schedules, business practices, trading and accounting standards, and  communications protocols have  played major  roles in establishing the spaces  of libraries, educational institutions and  commerce. They establish practical and  of-their-times ways  of knowing and  doing  things between and in the presence of other  things.
