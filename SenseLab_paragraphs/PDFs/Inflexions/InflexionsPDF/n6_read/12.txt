A critical  question concerns the  attachment Arakawa and  Gins  maintain to the individual body.  The body  assumes an in-the-moment alertness, autonomy and even athleticism in facing the surround. The surround becomes  – and  we see this sometimes  reflected  in  their   built   works   –  a  means   to  challenge  this  body.
‘Landing sites’ are situations of ‘pulsing contingency’ into which  the body  inserts itself,  linking   and   juggling  the  factors   of  life  here   and   in  the  moment.  For Arakawa and  Gins,  “Life – Bios – would seem  to be constituted by interactions between tentative constructings toward a holding in  place,  with  the  body,  the body-in-action, surely  the main  fiddler at the fair” (Gins and  Arakawa, 2002: 50). These  are  events   that   require  our  alert   response to  what   is  immediate and foregrounded. The times  here  are of action  and  reaction; they  frame  events  that are  transparent, or  that  the  body  aspires to  know  transparently. Arakawa and Gins   tend   also,  in  their   focus   of  the   body’s  awareness  of  its  surround  to understand that  surround as  resistance to  action,  a resistance that  needs  to  be overcome through ‘procedures.’
