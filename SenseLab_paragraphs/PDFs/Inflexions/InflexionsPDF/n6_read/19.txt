Arakawa and  Gins emphasise a bodily  subject  active  in surrounds, and  in space. What  we  need,  I propose, is to  define  surrounds as  active  with  the  body  and body-surrounds as spaces  in their  own  right.  The surround needs  to be a space integral with  and  prosthetic to the  body  as it acts. But this  will introduce other times,  and  the possession of body  and  ‘world’ we attain  in these  other  times  and spaces  is a common sense of the world that is common because it depends on constructions and  constructions on constructions that  go back to the beginnings of our embodied being. These other  times and spaces  may not be perceived in the moment  because  they   are  the   ground  of  our   perceiving.  They   are  already embedded, as the  structures of bodies  in surrounds, in the  sites  we  happen to land  in by virtue of birth,  life path  and  happenstance. We are creatures who  go through our lives forgetful of most of what  Michel Foucault called the “awesome materiality” of our  human-technical worlds (Foucault 1986: 149). But this forgetfulness is not an inattentiveness we must  discipline ourselves out of; it is a condition of the finitude and situatedness of our being, knowledge and action.
