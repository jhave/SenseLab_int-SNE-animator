practices and  technologies is not  a factor  (Hård and  Misa  2010). But any  search for   general,  abstract  or   theoretical  answers  to   these   questions  would  be misplaced: we find our way in the world and  then normalise, objectivise  and subjectivise   these   ways,   not   the   other   way   round.  Concrete  cases   are   all contingent attempts to  mould ‘worlds’ as  simultaneously technological- conceptual fields  and  fields  of practice. Architectures and  technological spaces become   part   of  the  human oikoumene where they   embody  reasons, produce subjects  and  objects and  establish places  for practical activity.  This material- organisational production of ‘space’ is an outcome of the hi-tech  of any time, and has  been  the  driving force in establishing human organisations, including a historically accumulated structure of places.
