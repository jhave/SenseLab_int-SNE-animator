producer of  discourse which  it  imposes on  the  surround. Arakawa and  Gins have  shifted attention to the body-surround relation; their  architectural body  is a merging of body  with  architecture, body  and  architecture merging to give  us a different architectural body.  However Arakawa and  Gins maintain a polarity between body  and  surround and  suggest that  it is in this  oppositional relation that  human life and  well-being may  be enhanced. This opposition defines space as a container â€“ for things in space  and  for body  in surround. This  opposition informs  the  hermeneutic  or  interpretive  state   of  the  body   in  relation  to  its surround.
