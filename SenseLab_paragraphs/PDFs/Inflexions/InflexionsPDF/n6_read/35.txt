The equipment is manipulated in ways  that  extend the intention, perception and practice of the  subject  outwards beyond what  is conventionally understood  as the limit  of the subject.  The setting  becomes  thus  both  physical and theoretical – “non-objective”  in Heelan’s  terms  – as the  equipment necessary to prepare the object  for observation comes  to embody the  intentions and  expectations of the subject.  The  human subject  also  becomes   technically maintained  in  a  specific relation with  the  scientific  object. The setting  is an artifice: nature and  its ‘laws’ are not present in the setup, instead ‘purpose’ is transferred to the equipment as the observer-scientist manipulates and  adjusts the appearance of phenomena through adjustments to the equipment. What science produces here is practically, hermeneutically, and crucially technologically constructed (Ihde 1998: 170-183).
