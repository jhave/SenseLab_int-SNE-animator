Then,  as  finite  restless  beings,  things don’t  simply come  to  make  sense  to  us between these  horizons; we  organise, manipulate and  construct things to make sense,   and   adjust   the  horizons  between  which   things  make   sense.   We  may understand  these   as   constructive  processes  with   conceptual  and   empirical matters being  brought together and  shaped in practice and  discourse. We – and here is where ideas  begin  to merge  with  material – manipulate and  construct not just the  conceptual but  also  the  empirical matters. We shape  our  surroundings, actively   objectifying  states   of  knowledge/affairs  as  arrays  and   structures  of material, organisational and  institutional matters which  make  sense  together. As subjects,   we  move   at  this   point   beyond  singular  ‘points  of  view’  and   into collective  or normative positions organised around language and  the  material- technical frames  (or ‘architectures’) in which  knowledges and  discourses are embedded. These  discourses and  ‘architectures’  may  be  multiple but  this  is a different multiplicity to that  which  sees there  being  different points of view  on the  world from  different subject  positions. Here,  there  are  different technically supported and  realised situations or settings, within which  ‘views’ on the world (or on different worlds!) are organised. These settings are available as ‘views’ to anyone who has access to and the skills to use them.
