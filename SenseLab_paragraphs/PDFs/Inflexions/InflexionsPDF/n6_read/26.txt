There  are  different versions of this  argument, including one  due  to Kuhn  who  sees  ‘paradigms’  as  organising and  bounding ‘bodies  of  belief’  in which  the  scopes  of practical action  and  legitimacy in  science  are  established (Kuhn  1962: 16-17). Another due  to Foucault sees ‘discourse' setting  the limits  on what   may   be   legitimately  thought  and   discussed  and   what   makes   sense (Foucault 1986).
