There is however still a question of power that  needs  to be addressed. These landscapes of ‘technological  spaces’  are  already formed. They  already network and select particular places in particular networks and leave out others.  And they incorporate massive differentials of power in the way  they  do this. Things  are in fact  already distributed  and   places   are  no  longer   the  ‘neutral  markers’  we sometimes take  them  for  (Gins  and  Arakawa 2002: 6). Particular practices are already preferred in particular networks and  not others:  there  is an enormous potential  advantage  in  being   plugged  into   a  network  of  global   traders  for example connected to servers that  distribute and  redistribute finance  at lightning speed, rather than  one that  draws together the components of an inner-city neighbourhood.  This  is  not   a  question  of  materiality  or  place-boundedness versus immateriality, virtuality or speed;  it is about  the distribution of different technological spaces,  all of them  material and  highly  designed but some  of them a great  deal  more  powerful than  others,  and  the  ways  they  connect  particular places and not others  and facilitate  particular practices and not others.
