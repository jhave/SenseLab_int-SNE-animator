But,  I  will  argue,   we  lose  contact   here  with   factors   of  the  surround and   of technique that  depend on  longer  times  and  a more  public  body.  We lose  how much  of the surround has to do with  background and  with  factors that are present while  being  systematically bracketed out  of  attention. We  could  also  end  up losing  how  it  is we  ‘person’  – losing  how  we  become  not  just  subject  to  and constrained in surrounds, but  subjects  of and  enabled by those  surrounds. From the phenomenological perspective I will adopt, the body  is necessarily subject  of its surround and  enabled by that  surround. My exploration will focus  more  on the other  half of the ‘architectural body,’  the surround, and  its spaces  and  times, in order to expand on this  ‘subjection.’ The question of our  determination in an
‘iron  cage’ of a technological space  of our  own  making is answered in several ways:  firstly  by the idea  that  this ‘cage’ is itself an ‘optic’ on life from  within life and  a means  to awareness that  enables actions  that  could  otherwise be inconceivable; that  it is multiple, comprising multiple ‘technological paradigms’ or  ‘technological  spaces’  as  specific  constructions embodying  different rationalities  or  modes  of  sense,   and   lastly;   by  the   idea   that   these   ‘spaces’ comprise possibilities for action we can enter  and  leave in life-paths that intersect with these other  spaces  already made.
