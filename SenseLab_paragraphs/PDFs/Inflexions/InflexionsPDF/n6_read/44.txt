settings. The  objects  and  objectivities  the  experiment reveals,   depend on  the finely-adjusted conditions this construction maintains and  is constructed to maintain. Heelan speaks of an ‘horizonal realism’ as meanings are embodied as intentional structures in  ‘non-objective’  public  and  institutional hardware and practices.  Practical   settings are  in  other   words simultaneously empirical and meaning horizons embodied in equipment in such  a way  they  positively realise the  subjects  and  objects  they  interiorise. These  structures are  synthetic  and  it is precisely  the   bracketing  of  nature  and   the   universe  out  of  the   action   that guarantees the appearance of objects as legitimate or real.
