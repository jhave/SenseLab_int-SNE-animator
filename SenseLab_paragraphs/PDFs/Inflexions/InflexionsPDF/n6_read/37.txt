regularised and  repeatable observations and  actions  – consistent within horizons of  the  setting   and   of  expectation –  can  be  made.   Seeing  is  not  achieved by passively  receiving  an  impression;  it  is  something  actively   prepared  and   it involves physical and  intentional conditions which  frame  outcomes and  the way these may vary under the control  of the equipment or setting.  A relation between language, observation and  objects is negotiated in the experiment so that  there  is in the end  no hard distinction to be made  between observational and  theoretical entities.  “[T]heory says what  observation can see” (Heelan 1977: 30) and abstractions, including models and  theories, are for making those  states  of affairs that  science  speaks about  observable. Heelan saw  that  experimental physics is not  trying to  attain   a  theoretical model   of  the  world so  much   as  construct practical models for the purposes of observation and measurement!
