[1] Heidegger was the author in Being and Time not only of the concept  of Dasein (being  there),  but  also of that  of Mitsein (being  with).  The interpretation I follow of  this  term   is  not  that  of  Hubert  Dreyfus, who  argued indeed that  Mitsein represented some essential idea of Man, but is closer to that  of Frederick Olafson (Olafson1994: 52; Read 2008: 10-11)
