We don’t  just expand hermeneutics therefore; we also extend hermeneutics into multiple ‘networks,’ ‘spheres’ or ‘spaces’ inside  which  particular expanded hermeneutics operate. None  of this is watertight of course,  all of it requires a continual work  of maintenance to sustain, all of it is about  the structures, orders and  rationalities that  are  the  necessary condition of knowledge and  action  and that  we take  the  most  for granted and  maintain most  unthinkingly. It concerns, as Foucault has put  it, the “ponderous, awesome materiality” of the “production of discourse” (Foucault, 1986:149). We know  the  theoretical horizons;  we  have the knowledge to deal with  this world we find ourselves part  of; what’s often not clear, and  this seems counterintuitive given  its ‘awesome materiality,’ are the empirical horizons. But by now  it should be quite  clear why  these  horizons don’t reveal  themselves easily to us as conditions of knowledge: the embedding of discourse as authorised or veridical knowledge in the world is precisely what  we bracket  out as part  of our  procedures of knowledge. ‘Theory’ is what  is left over once we have  discounted the  historical and  situational fact we have  created the conditions for the  having of that  knowledge. ‘Theory’ is what  is left over  when we  discount the  real  world techniques and  technologies of that  knowledge we and   our  forebears  have   built   into  the  world –  techniques that   hold   us  into
