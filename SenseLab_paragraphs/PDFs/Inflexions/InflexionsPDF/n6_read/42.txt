Horizons or  bounds are  constructed to  frame  particular subjects,  objects  and practices within controlled settings. Nancy Cartwright has  highlighted the  way equipment and  setting  shield  experiments from unwanted and  contaminating influence (Cartwright 1999). This ‘shielding’ plays  a more  than  prophylactic role however; it also distributes objects  and  ‘optics’ and  even  steers  the  processes of experimentation towards expected ends.  I have  begun here  with  the highly specialised  setting    of   the   experiment  itself,   equipped  for   the   specialised knowledge and  observation of objects  like  magnetic fields,  chemical clocks,  or light  waves.  But other  equipment is also  involved: even  the  door  shielding the laboratory from  the  rest  of the  institute plays  a more  than  negative or  neutral role.  While   it  shields  the  experiment  from   interference  and   noise   that   may contaminate data  or distract the experimenter, it also creates  a bound positively involved with the maintenance of meaning.
