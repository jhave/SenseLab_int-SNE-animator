Whatever is happening in the mind or brain  is not an issue  because it is not the body  on its own  that  knows and  does. But there  is nowhere in a timeless or instantaneous event  for sense  to be located  but  in the  body.  We re-establish by default an  interiority the  shift  to  embodiment was  supposed to  leave  behind. There are only lives in surrounds and  what  we need  to understand better  are the times  and  spaces  of these  lives and  their  surrounds. We need  in fact to shift the emphasis away  from  the ‘body’ as ‘main fiddler,’  to restore the body’s essential link with  ‘world’ and  look for answers in that  link. If instead of approaching the problem of embodiment through the attention of the body  alert  to the events  of the moment in its surround, we did  that  through what  the body  forgets  about  its surround, as  it  forgets  its  body  in  action,  we  may  find  back  some  necessary conditions of our  embodiment, no longer  in the body  in a surround, but  in that surround as it constitutes and enables the active body.
