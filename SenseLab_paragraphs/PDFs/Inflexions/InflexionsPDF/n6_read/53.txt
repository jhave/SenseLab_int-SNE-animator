The organisational principle extends into  geography:  laboratory and  university are  themselves embedded in our  built  environment in structures that  organise and  divide territories, and  legitimate places  for certain  practices and  actions  and not for others.  This is not simply a matter of imposed norms and  rules as ways  to discipline territories and  their  use  but  also  a  more  subtle  discipline of things being ‘in place’ and making sense in relation to other  things. The chief techniques behind  these    practicalities   and    normalities   are   of   course    language  and
‘architecture’  – though the  ‘architectures’  I will  refer  to  later  have  a particular web-like or network quality. This is a political  geography of communities, places and territories organised in spatial technique.
