This is not identical with  Arakawa and  Gins’ position and  the answer I will try to approach concerning questions of life, technology and  knowledge will  not  join seamlessly with  their  research. I will emphasise finitude, history and  convention, knowing full well the words do not appear in Arakawa and  Gins’ writings. Nevertheless, to become  the beings  Arakawa and  Gins’ address in their  research, to  become   the  beings  we  might   become,   we  will  need,   I will  argue,   to  pass through the  essential historicity, finitude and  technique of our  own  existence. This paper will  explore  issues  of orders that  bind  and  enable  in order to fill in what   I regard as  some  necessary background  for  further work  on  the  body- surround or architectural body.
