constrain, determining what  we can and  cannot  do, what  we can and  cannot  see and  even what  we understand as being  conceivable. Arakawa and  Gins attempt, like Helen  Keller,  to awake each  day  to make  the  world anew.  They  attempt to escape  history but  what  we  cannot   escape  is  the  fact  we  do  this  environed in history, where, like  it  or  not,  possibilities for  escape  may  emerge only  from within historical sedimentations of technique. The chief irony  is that for the finite beings   we  are,  the  supporting  threads of  the  very   enablement  we  want   to enhance are tied  into  locations and  situations historically formed. We deal  with an intelligence that  distributes in the surround itself, one that  already integrates body  and  surround in  activity.  And  structures formed in  these  layers  are  the surface  on which  any further procedural ‘texts’ must  be written.
