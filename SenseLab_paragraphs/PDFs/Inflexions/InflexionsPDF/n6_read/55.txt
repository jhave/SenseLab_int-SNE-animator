I have  likened these  structures to ‘paradigms’ so that  ‘technological paradigms’ would be bounded or horizoned spaces  or of objects, subjects  and  practices. The notion captures the fact that  in a contextual world, subjects,  objects and  practices hang  together in organised settings and  their  meanings are conditional on their being  framed together. In such  a view  the emphasis is on surround as a space  in which  things and  ways  of doing  things come in whole  arrangements which  need to be assembled, maintained and  practiced in order that  meanings come  to be and   remain  stable.   It  is  not   only   subjectivities   that   are   formed  in   these arrangements but also objectivities, the realities of which  depend on the horizons in  which   they   are   framed.  There   is  a  material  basis   to  the   meaning and significance of worldly entities  in  being with  other  entities,  and  in  order to  be durably what  they  are,  they  need  to be held  in place  and  maintained in these relationships. The process  of the  shaping of life in technology creates  spaces  of things and  ways  of doing  things centred around meaningful objective  stuff  and
