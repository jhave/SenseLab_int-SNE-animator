I am extending the idea of non-objective equipment outwards in nested bounded domains. We could  understand this nesting in different ways: one way would be through a nested structure of scientific  authority in  which  the  experimenter is part  of a scientific  community formalised in faculties,  national and  international associations  with   conferences  and   journals,  and   all  within a  larger   scientific division  of  labour  of  authorised  and   accredited domains, disciplines and subdisciplines; another would start from the physical apparatus, and go on to the laboratory in which  the experiment is carried out, to the institutional building in which  the laboratory is housed, to the campus, to the neighbourhood or district, to the city and  so on. These two modes are not disconnected; they  come together in  life,  and   in  practical  and   theoretical  organisation,  within  which   issues   of practicality and legitimacy are negotiated as public  and normative.
