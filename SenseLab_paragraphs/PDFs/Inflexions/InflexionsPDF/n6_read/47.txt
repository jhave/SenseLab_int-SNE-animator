We begin  in a sense,  with  this idea  of ‘construction,’ to materialise and  spatialise the  notions of ‘paradigm’ and  ‘discourse.’ A paradigm is, according to Kuhn,  a "body  of intertwined theoretical and  methodological belief" (Kuhn  1962: 16-17). A   ‘discourse’   is   the   bodies    of   “rules    concerned  with    the   principles  of classification, ordering and  distribution” (Foucault 1986: 152). Empirical horizons are themselves embodied in ‘equipment’ which  also embodies ‘theory’ at every level  of  the  construction.  The  notion  of  expanded  or  material  hermeneutics allows  us to conflate  the horizons of ‘bodies of belief’ and  ‘bodies of rules’ with empirical horizons. Both paradigms and  discourses are embodied and  produced in  specific  locations.  What   we  end  up  with   are  shielded  settings which   are themselves centred and  decentred, located   in  and  extended by,  ‘networks’  or
‘spheres’[5]  interior to which  sensible  or authorised – in any  event  consistent – logics or rationalities linking  subjects  and  objects operate, along  with  sensible  or approved modes of action.
