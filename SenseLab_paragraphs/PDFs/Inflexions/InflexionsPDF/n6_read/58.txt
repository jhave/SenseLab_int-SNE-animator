We move  with  this idea  beyond considerations of technology as something to be simply used  or read  by a subject  and  as exterior to human life. We move  beyond it being  a contemporary force  for a generalised alienation. We move  instead to consider  technologies  as   implicated  in   ‘spheres’   of   life   through  multiple particular spaces  of  perception, conception and  practice in  which  objects  and subjects  are revealed (Read  2008: 7-22). A description by Roland Barthes  of 17th Century Amsterdam serves  as an example: he spoke  of the "itemizing power" of Amsterdam’s canals as “objects interrupt each horizon, glide along the water and along  the  walls.  It is objects  which  articulate space.  The  object  is by  and  large constituted by this mobility, Hence  the defining power of all these  Dutch  canals. What  we have  clearly  is a water-merchandise complex … making the entire  city into a census  of agile goods” (Barthes 1972: 6-7).
