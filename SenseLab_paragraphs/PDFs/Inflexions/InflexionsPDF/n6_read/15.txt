An attempt to live wholly  in the time  and  space  of now  and  here  could  end  up looking  like a tragic attempt to reclaim  the infinite.  The issue of embodiment and of being  part  of a world is one  of being  creatures of time  and  space.  But these spaces  and  times  are neither absolute nor transparent. If the body  is subject of its surround and  ‘persons’ in relation to that  surround, the  surround is ‘world’ for that  body:  it is that  in which  both  we and  what  we know  and  do are embodied. These  ‘worlds’  are  also  constructions, put  together technically and  historically precisely to  facilitate   this  knowing and  doing.   They  are  public  and  technical
‘worlds’ of enablement that incorporate times and  spaces  beyond those of the individual body.  But that  seeing  and  making sense  also  elides  or  brackets out crucial aspects of the surround.
