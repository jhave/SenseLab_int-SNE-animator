Science  is  therefore  not   an  accumulation  of  and   systematisation  of  factual information about  the world, but  involves the construction of settings or frames that   link  and   articulate  subject   and   object  sides   of  the  problem along   with appropriate  practices. These  settings or  frames   embody  practical rationales – operationalised in models and  equipment – that  form and  transform our view  of the world, constructing new realities in the process.  This is not about  models substituting for reality,  but  about  reality  interpreted through the  use  of models. We are  no  longer  looking  at  theory as  an  abstract disembodied component of science, but as a materialised cycle involving an intentional subject-equipment complex and  a scientific  object that is disclosed or produced in that complex. Observation itself  comes  to  depend on  the  apparatus and  instrumentation in which  a particular theoretical ‘optic’ is maintained. The setting  is a machine for objectification  as things come  to be the  way  we  see  them  in the  equipment or setting.
