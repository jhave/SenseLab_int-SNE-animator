In fact the  idea  of ‘technological paradigms’ has  been  used  before.  But Manuel Castells’  version of  the  ‘technological  paradigm’  emphasises a  new  condition lead  by microelectronic communication media and  the new  social organisational structures  they   enable   (Castells   1989:  12-13).  It  misses   the   more   everyday structured entanglement of technologies in life. Castells  ‘paradigm’ is a singular condition  and   misses   the  massive  multiplicity  of  the  ‘paradigms’  as  I  have outlined  them   here.   In  fact,   the   technologies  themselves  are   perhaps  less significant than  the ‘technological spaces’ they produce and  in which  the technologies are tactically  enrolled.
