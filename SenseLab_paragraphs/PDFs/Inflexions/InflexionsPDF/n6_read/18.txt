The question of space is important here: Arakawa and  Gins’ spaces  are still filled with  things (Gins  and  Arakawa 2002: 39), or  they  are  skins  moulded to  and protective of  the  body  (Gins  and  Arakawa 2002: xv).  They  are  spaces  within which  the body  “disports” in “cognising stances” (Gins and  Arakawa 2002: xxi).
