Spatial  techniques and  technologies will  be, in this  way  of thinking, more  than simply means  to movement or  communication; they  will  be more  than  simply ways  to ‘compress’ a space already given  by the geodesic surface  of our globe. A conventional view  of network space  used  in  geography today, sees  the  world from the outside and  imagines flows of people, things and  especially money crisscrossing  the  surface   of  the  globe   seen   from   a  stratospheric  perspective (Massey   1994: 146-156).  These  other   spaces   I  am  talking about   are  radically different to this: they are generated out of the subject-object relation and  built out in the world from this perspective. They are built out in the process  of producing or constructing settings which  are  a condition of knowledge and  action.  These settings and  spaces  are multiple, comprising ‘worlds’ in which  particular rationalities are  interiorised and  shielded from  the  universe, and  within which facts,  things and  ideas,  and  the  practices that  accompany them,  are  produced together and  make  sense  in relation to each other.  The overall  pattern seen from the stratosphere would, drawing on Cartwright again,  be “dappled” (Cartwright
1999). However, in the normal course  of events  we would never  see them  in this perspective but  rather in life paths that  take  us in varying forms  of subjectivity through the different ‘spheres’ of our practical lives.
