Human surrounds  are  finite,  ‘public’  and   humanly made   and   structured  as multiple enabling non-objective ‘worlds.’ Objects are oriented and  available to us in  these  ‘worlds’  in  practical settings  and   in  relation to  other   objects.  In  an organised  equipmentality  Dasein  (being   there   or  existence)   becomes   Mitsein (being with or coexistence), even when other  people are not immediately present. In Hannah Arendt’s words we live in a world “between men”,  but  also between the things that  are human in more  historical times  and  senses.  We construct and adapt these ‘worlds,’ and  have done  so as long as we have been building, to have
‘things in place.’ We are, in Heidegger’s terms,  ‘thrown’ into a world already structured and  already expectant in material and  practical ways  of knowing and doing  things. The publicness I refer  to is a dense  web  of ties  to ‘indeterminate others’   that   references  common  worlds  of  equipped  situations  which   are conditions of our acting.  We become  public  between things and  others  in a realm Michel  de  Certeau characterises as “the  oceanic  rumble of the  ordinary … the place from which  discourse is produced” (De Certeau 1984: 5).
