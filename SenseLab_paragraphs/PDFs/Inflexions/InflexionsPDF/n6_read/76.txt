[4] The  notion of Lebenswelt or  lifeworld was  introduced by  Edmund Husserl. The lifeworld is identified as “the  only  real world, the one that  is actually given through perception, that  is ever experienced and  experienceable.” He opposes it to the ideal  world of Galilean science where there  is a “surreptitious substitution of the  mathematically substructed world of idealities for  the  only  real  world” (Husserl 1970: 48). Heelan argues that  the observable scientific  entities  of experimental science belong  to the lifeworld.
