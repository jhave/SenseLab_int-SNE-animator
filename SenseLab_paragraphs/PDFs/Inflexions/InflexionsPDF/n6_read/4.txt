Arakawa and  Gins are concerned with  the bio-tech  creatures we have  become  – or  perhaps the  ones   we  have   always  been.   They  see  us  as  creatures-with- architecture, architecture being  for  them,  and  along  with  language, one  of the most  basic forms  of technique. Their ‘architectural body’ is constitutive of its own existence  in an  ‘architectural  surround’  which  is itself  part  of that  constitution. The body  here is not enclosed within its own  outline but is extended in time and space into its surround; it acts and makes  itself – it ‘persons’ in their terms  – in an active   relation  to  the  surround.  Perception and   action   involve  more   than   a subjective  interiority, or  simply a biological  body,  they  involve the  whole  bio- tech ‘architectural body.’ Arakawa and  Gins contribute to a view that  human life is distributed, in the  world and  self-forming in constitutive and  heterogeneous relations which  mingle  the biological  and  the technological. There is in this view
– and  pace  Heidegger and  Ellul – no essential conflict  between technology and the human; here, technique becomes  a human and anthropological issue.
