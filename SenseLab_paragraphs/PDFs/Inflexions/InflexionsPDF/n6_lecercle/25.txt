We find  ourselves in a philosophical universe where agency,  the attribute of the classical subject, as centre  of action and  consciousness, as bearer  of the identity of a person, is no  longer  sufficient, where it must  give  way  to  impersonal, non- individual, pre-subjective “agencying” (those  three  adjectives define  the characteristics of what  Deleuze calls a haecceity), even  as “person” gives  way  to “personing.” This universe is a long-term consequence of Kant’s Copernican revolution, when he  split  the  unity  of the  Cartesian cogito into  a psychological self, endowed with all the characteristics of a person, and a transcendental ego, an empty form  consisting of categories and  forms  of intuition, to be filled  with  the empirical  data   of  experience.  The  time   of  the   “-ing”   process,   the   time   of tentativeness  and   procedures  is  the   time   of  this   filling,   which   means   that Arakawa and  Gins’s philosophy might  be described as a form  of transcendental empiricism (and  we remember that  this  is how  Gilles Deleuze defined his own philosophical project  in the period of Difference and Repetition and  Logic of Sense). It is the time of what  they call not “event,”but “eventing.”
