the   time   involved  is  the   time   of  procedures  (a  series   of  structural  moves, captured by  the  gerund form  that  inscribes through  synecdoche the  totality of the segments of the event)  and  it is the time  of tentativeness, of the exploring of the  world through the  Keatsian snail  horn  perception of the  architectural body that  the  architectural surrounding of an Arakawa and  Gins  building induces or produces (and  the  “-ing”  marker inscribes such  tentativeness, by shifting tense into  aspect:  what  is called  the “continuous present” in grammar is not the mark of a tense  but  of an  aspect,  the  imperfective aspect);  (v) the  entities  involved, which  are  steeped in the  time  of tentativeness and  procedures, are  not  objects, nor are they  subjects,  but events  in the sense  of Deleuze: the only fixed points in this  model  of the  event  (the  initiator and  endpoint in Croft’s  diagram) are  not individuals  (subjects   and   objects)  but   haecceities  and   collective   assemblages (Deleuze speaks of assemblages of enunciation: in the case of Arakawa and  Gins, we will speak  of architectural assemblages).
