movements (“comings-up”) but  also  affects  (“irritatings”). And  here  we  must move  from  one  concept  of event  to another. I suggested in my  earlier  text  that Arakawa and  Gins,  with  their  concept  of event  – we  can  now  add:  with  their conversion of  events   into  eventings – soon  part   company with  the  rare  and violent  upheaval of Badiou  events.  Their concept  of eventing is now  much  closer to what  Deleuze means  by “event.”
