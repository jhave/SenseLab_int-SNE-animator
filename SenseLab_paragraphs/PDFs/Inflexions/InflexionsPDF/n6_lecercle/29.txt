The  time  has  come  to summarize the  philosophical work  that  their  apparently obsessive use  of the  “-ing”  form  enables Arakawa and  Gins  to complete: (i) in concentrating on the moment of change, even if the grammatical form is that  of a noun  (derived from  a verb),  they  blur  the limits  or dissolve the fixity of objects: the only entities  are not fixed objects but processes and  becomings; (ii) the “-ing” form  has  another grammatical asset:  qua participle or  gerund, it  is  a  form  in which  the  grammatical subject,  the  subject  of  agency,  may  not  be  expressed, which  engages a blurring or dissolution not only of the object but  of the subject, as  “agencying”  replaces  “agency”;  (iii)  agency,   therefore,  becomes   not   the attribute of an individual subject (endowed with  consciousness and  moral responsibility) but of a structure, that  is a series of practices and  procedures; (iv) this -ing term  involves a change in the concept  of time,  which  becomes  the time corresponding to what  I have  called  Arakawa and  Gins’s materialism of space:
