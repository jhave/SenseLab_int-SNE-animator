Agencying.   In   fits   and   starts,   organisms  that   person  generate agency,  or better,  agencying. Although how  a person has agency/agencying remains a matter of supposition, “the  having of agency”  would  likely   be   high   on   any   thinker’s  list   of  traits necessary  and   sufficient  to  (being)   a  person.  Throughout  this writing, one of whose  primary goals is the keeping of the notion of person fluid  and  open,  the  notion of agencying, which  keeps  the emphasis on  action,  no  entity  intended, will  be used  to modulate the  notion of person. An  agencying organism that persons. (Arakawa and Gins, work  in progress)
