categories  of  noun   and   verb   and   to  multiply  entities   (events,   eventuatings, eventings, eventnings)? My  contention is  that  it  is  both,  so  that  the  question becomes:   how  can  a  grammatical suffix  which   is  the  mark   of  a  style  be  the instrument of a philosophical construction? We know  that  philosophy is a kind of writing, and  that  philosophers often  have  style: what  we need  to know  is the precise  function of this grammatical marker.
