I would like to pursue Croft’s analysis by suggesting that  the  segments may  be grammaticalized by using  grammatical suffixes  or auxiliaries. Thus,  as the  very canonical  example  shows,   the  STATE  segment  is  not   only   included  in  the semantic constitution of some verbs,  like “break” or “kill,” it is also expressed by the  suffix  of  the  past   participle.  In  the  same   vein,   the  CAUSE  segment  is expressed by quasi-auxiliaries like “cause” (“the  earthquake caused the  wall  to collapse”), “make” (“they  made  her drink tea at breakfast”) and  “have” (“we had the house  restructured by Arakawa and  Gins”).  What  I would like to suggest is that  the  third segment, CHANGE, is expressed by  the  “-ing”  suffix,  hence  the constant use  of the  suffix  to  express action  and/or becoming, not  only  in  the form  of the  continuous or “imperfective” aspect  (“imperfective” means  that  the action  has  begun but  is not  yet  finished), as  in  “What  are  Gins  and  Arakawa doing  these days?”,  but in gerunds, which  typically express a process  (of change) in nominal terms,  as in “the eventuating of its eventings”: the role of the coinages is to present (to make  present) not  the  event  as result  but  the  event  as process. And  since  verbs  are typically meant to express events  (actions  and  becomings), and  the  meaningful center  of the  model  is the  CHANGE segment, the  “-ing” suffix will be able, through synecdoche, to express not only the central  segment, but the whole  “individual event”, which  explains why  “eventing,” the name  of a
