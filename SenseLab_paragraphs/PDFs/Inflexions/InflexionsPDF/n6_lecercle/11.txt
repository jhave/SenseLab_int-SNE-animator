Sentence  (1), with  thanks to Robbie Burns, uses an archaic  form, which  illustrates the   origin   of  the   present  continuous  (“they   are   on  hunting”,  “they   are   a- hunting”, “they   are  hunting”). It  also  contains a  noun,   derived from  a  verb through the suffix “-ing.”  Sentence  (2) has an adjective, with  all the usual appurtenances, like degree (“this  is most  amazing”), derived from  a present participle. Sentence  (3) has  an occurrence of the present continuous. In sentence (4), the  same  verbal  form  has  become  a  full-fledged noun,   complete with  its plural marker, whereas in sentence (5), the same form is a gerund – a noun  form, but unaffected by number.
