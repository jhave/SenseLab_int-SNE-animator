Deleuze  derives  his  conception  of  events   from   the   Stoics,  with   their   pan- somatism (there  are only bodies  and  mixtures of bodies,  for instance the mixture of the knife that cuts the flesh and  the flesh that it cuts). The actions  and  passions of such mixtures have  effects that  are incorporeal: the event  is that  mist hovering over  the surface  of bodies  and  states  of affair,  a metaphysical surface.  Thus,  the knife and flesh are enveloped in the mist of the event  of wounding. Deleuze, who writes  in French,  claims that  the event  is captured in language not by a noun  but by a verb  in the infinitive. But this is only because the French  language does  not know  the glory  of the “-ing”  suffix (which  will pose  a problem to the translators of  Arakawa and  Gins  into  French):  in  English,   it  is  naturally captured by  a gerund (“wounding”), which,  as bearer  of the “-ing”  suffix does  not merely turn the  verb  into  a noun,  but  expresses the  moment of change and  becoming in its very grammatical form.
