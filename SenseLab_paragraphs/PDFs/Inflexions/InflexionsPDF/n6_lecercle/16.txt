Events  encoded as  verbs  consist  of those  three  segments. Thus,  the  canonical example of an “event” embodied in a verb may be found in “he broke the glass,” where “he” is the initiator, “the glass”  the endpoint, and  the verb may be glossed as “(he)  caused (the  glass)  to become  broken” (in the  same  vein,  the  verb  “kill” will be glossed as “cause  to become  dead”). Some verbs  will select only some  of those  segments: causative verbs  will select  all three,  inchoative verbs  will select the last two, and stative  verbs (or adjectives) only the last.
