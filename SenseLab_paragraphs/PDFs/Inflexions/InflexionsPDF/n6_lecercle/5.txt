A constituting procedure initiates and  geysers  forth  eventings or eventnings at any number of different speeds, often simultaneously letting  loose every  speed in its repertoire. A constituting procedure that  could  not  pace  the  eventuating of its eventings or eventnings would come up empty. (Arakawa and Gins, work  in progress)
