becoming, of a process,  may  also  express the  process  and its result, or rather its result  in so far as it still contains, as a virtuality, the  process  of which  it is the actualization (I am  suggesting that  the  “-ing”  suffix  is a philosophical tool  that inscribes what  Deleuze calls “the virtual”): by which  time the word has become  a full-fledged  noun,   and   can   be   used   in   the   plural,  as   in   “eventings and eventnings”. The  philosophical importance, therefore, of  the  “-ing”  marker, a glory  of  English  grammar, is  that  it  expresses both  the  time  of  becoming, of process,  and  the fixing  of the result  of the process  into  a noun,  the name  for an entity.  In other  words, it enables the English  language to name  entities  not in so far as they are fixed objects in space, but in so far as they are condensed forms  of time,  not  the  time  of chronology but  the  time  of the  virtual, what  Deleuze calls Aiôn: virtual processes become  actual  entities,  expressed through a grammatical displacement (from  verb  to  noun)   which   is  the  grammatical equivalent  of  a metaphor. The “-ing”  marker expresses not  so much  time  in the  form  of space (our  languages are  rich  in metaphors that  do  just that,  as in “time’s  arrow”) as space  (a fixed  object  or  an  actualized state  of affairs)  in  the  form  of time  (an ongoing process  or a series of virtualities, a sequence of tentativeness).
