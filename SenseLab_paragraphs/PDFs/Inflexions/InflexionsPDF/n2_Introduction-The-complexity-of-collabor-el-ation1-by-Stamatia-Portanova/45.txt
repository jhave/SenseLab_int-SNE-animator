themselves. As a feeling concrete  and  vague,  cadenced and  fluid, actual  and virtual at the same time, rhythm is key to the ontological duplicity of the relation: collaborative togetherness is always rhythmic. The rhythmic conceptualisation that Parisi and  Goodman derive from Whitehead’s philosophy positions itself beyond the aporia affirmed by Bergson’s metaphysics of total continuity as opposed to Bachelard’s arithmetisation of duration. With its ‘vibratory’ nature, the extensive continuum is defined by them  as “gelling potential”, a generalised potential activity  or relationality which,  in physical terms,  corresponds to the resonance of quantum regions among themselves. This resonance allows  the encounter or the nexus of actual  occasions to take place through “the in-between of oscillation, the vibration of vibration, the virtuality of the tremble.” Parisi and Goodman’s argument connects the virtuality of the tremble, or the relational potential between actual  entities, to a ‘nonconscious calculation’ which  is not merely  reducible to an infinitesimal quantification of experience but appears as the experience of a ‘quantifiability’ beyond or before actual  quantifications, a computability that cannot be humanly or digitally processed but only ‘felt’. Their claim is conveyed as a sort of ‘futuristic’ appeal to think  the surplus value  of the digital code, in a sort of conceptually felt mathematics coupling the scientific precision of computation to the dissolution of traditional ontological givens  (like subject or object, human or technological, analog or digital as necessary presuppositions for feeling,  concept or computation). The rigor  of scientific formulations is thus  associated in their  writing to the un-formed or un- formulated of philosophical thought, in a sort of affirmative problematisation, or a questioning claim where the reality  of the (thought) relation is subtracted from its most familiar and  safe ground.
