The choreographic proposition is always collaborative: it works  on a transversal ecology  of objects and languages, moving bodies  and thoughts-ideas, and  also of the spacetimes created and creating them,  in a multiplicity of environmental links and  temporal re-animations which  makes  it logically  impossible to define any body,  any object or any movement as individual or solitary in itself. As
much  as they are never  solipsistic, choreographic collaborations are never
innocuous either,  and do not occur as unproblematic executions of a demand or a task, but always actualise a contrast by “changing the terms  of the relation and bringing them into new configurations.” The creative becoming of the proposition works  as a cut in the continuous fabric of movement potential, ‘an
in-gathering of intensities’ re-directed by a set of parameters that ‘precisely’ carve out the experiential realisation of movement from past to present. The precision of the cut is key to the realisation: “Like his choreographies, Forsythe’s choreographic objects are created with  very precise  immanent conditions for movement: they insist on the precision of parameters for movement without divesting the movement of its potential for eventness. They are unforeseeable in their  effects yet carefully crafted algorithms for participation.” The propositional
‘abstraction’ of choreography from the body  of the dancer requires in return a precise  experimentation with  the ‘thingness’ of eternal objects or pure
