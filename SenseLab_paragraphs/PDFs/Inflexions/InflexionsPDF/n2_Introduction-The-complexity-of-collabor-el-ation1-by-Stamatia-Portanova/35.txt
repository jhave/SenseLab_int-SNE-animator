Rothfield’s conceptualisation of a felt alliance between feeling and thought in the process  of actualisation of a danced movement, introduces us once again into the field of a reciprocal interrogation between philosophy and  choreography. This time, the moving body is a specific dancing body,  the body of Philipa as a dancer and  as a philosopher questioning her own dancing in relation to Russell Dumas’s choreography. The collaborative proposition between philosophy and dance engages now the former  in its capacity to encircle and capture the movement while at the same time allowing it to continue “unperturbed”, and to always
keep enough space for itself to appear through the concepts. The sense of Rothfield’s question is not so much  enclosed in a philosophical reflection ‘on’ dance,  but in the possibility to pose a ‘physical’ question to both philosophy and dance,  addressing choreographed dance as a movement with  a propositional specificity of its own. The ontological question of creativity is therefore inflected here towards the physicality of the dancing body  which,  without relying on any pre-existing subjectivity to guide and  perform the movement, holds  and witnesses a phenomenal process  of subjective emergence and self-individuation alongside the dance.  The ontological condition for this emergence to happen is, for Rothfield, process in itself, the “process of the feeling”,  a process alive with potential indetermination and,  at the same time, with  a resolute intention to become  dance.  Dance and  subjectivity as the felt ‘appearances’ of the untiring work  of time.
