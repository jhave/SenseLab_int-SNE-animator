to a specific cognitive process, but is first and foremost the necessary ontological condition for a concept of the ‘new’ to be created. For this very reason, the function is not even to be intended as a particular algorithmic process  (a functional proposition already appropriated by a primordial intentionality and already directed towards specific ends), but as a generalised function spreading its ontological resonance everywhere. It cannot be read  as indicative of a specific rule or order but as a general condition coinciding with  the ‘ordination of order’, the ‘structuring of structure’: creative relationality understood as a logical irreducible, the “ultimate, underivable condition of transformation or composition, the universal principle of construction or actualization.” As a configuration of rules and  an origination of patterns, activity constitutes the undetermined condition for every determination, a sort of transcendental ground which  is proper of matter itself (a field of emergence in scientific terms,  or an immanent plane  in philosophical terms).  Whitehead’s opening of the metaphysical field of philosophy to the logic of mathematical thought is
therefore to be considered in this context  as a possibility for generalised
reflection on creativity and its conditions, a way to open  up a field of speculative discussion and introduce a virtual immanent plane  that comes ‘apparitionally before’ its successive actualisations: the function, in this case, as a concept about to come. As Bradley  explains, Whitehead’s identification of ‘infinite creative activity’ with the mathematical function is aimed at bringing to light its
‘meaning’: not the specificity of a particular relation but the way in which
relations can be directed according to specific functions, structures or rules. At the same time, the mathematical identification also clarifies the function in its
‘range’: not the concreteness of a particular nexus,  but the various ways in which the relational principle of creativity can be incarnated by specific relations of bodies  and  things.
