in the articulated conceptual continuum of the whole  structure. In the end, what is realised is a series of non-correspondent relations in which  the syncopated failures and successes of communication, the risk of excessive  conformation or of total chaotic slippage, are overcome by a common rejoicing  in the autonomy of expression and  in the exploitation of the gap: the communication of a clear content gives way to the creation of experiential occasions,  philosophical referents are extended into immanent worlds to play or fight with, subjective words become  styles. In turn,  each of these singular worlds feeds on the particular collaborative relations appearing between its own composing elements: concrete  actions  of the everyday, like walking or moving the furniture, can thus  be coupled to ontological conceptualisations, dance  and philosophy reciprocally potentialise themselves, live performative experiences are accompanied by technological scenarios, science ‘with’ art, mathematics ‘and’ audiovision, attentive reflections combined with  futuristic thoughts. And  all these elements co-work towards an idea, or the variation of an idea. The idea (as the generative momentum for the issue) is to create something ‘with’ the notion of the in-between: because having an idea is always to be creative with the in- between.
