experiences of movement, identified by Manning as events-effects of ‘moving through’, ‘sitting with’, ‘getting-there-first’. These experiential vectors  become precisely directed by the algorithmic configurational force of a verbal choreographic proposition (or of an object, as in Forsythe’s participatory installations). As a ‘platform for relation’, language abandons its communicational denotative function and  vacillates between actual  and virtual time, its propositional sentences coagulating the virtuality of a movement effect into a feeling of the specious present: what  emerges is an amplified attention for the lived time of movement in its unfolding. Or for the time it takes to ‘move through’, ‘sit with’ or ‘get-there-first’.
