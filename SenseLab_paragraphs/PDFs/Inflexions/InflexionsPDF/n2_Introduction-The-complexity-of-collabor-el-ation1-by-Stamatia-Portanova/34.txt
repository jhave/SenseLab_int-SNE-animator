The experience of movement’s lived time is for Manning what  qualitatively brings forth time as felt: a ‘thickness of feeling’, in Philipa Rothfield’s words, an experiential alteration doubling the oscillation of the movement event  between a creatively re-animated past and an actualising present. The relation needs  to be felt. As the basic relational events  in our physical and conceptual connection to the world, feelings (or prehensions) compose a sort of experiential quantum, a rhythmic vibration through which  past and future actual  entities can relate to each other  along  the wave-lengths of their corresponding qualities (in the case of physical prehensions) or of their abstract potentials (in the case of conceptual prehensions), and  create a nexus. Movement unfolds in relation with  perception and  thought, as it is doubled by feeling.
