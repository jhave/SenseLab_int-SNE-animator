Both the techno-centrism and  the anthropocentrism usually related to audiovisual and interactive technologies are ontologically questioned by Parisi and  Goodman, who ask: “what if the user is any actual  entity  whatever among the other  components of an ecology?”  Parisi and  Goodman’s argument is based on a critique of the need  for participatory interventions that, according to them, are indicative of a metaphysics of continuity over discontinuity whereby the
‘humanly lived’ and fluid experience of the participant is added to the pre- programmed digital space in order to create novelty. For them,  Whitehead’s concept of the extensive continuum becomes  the ontological basis, the conceptual potentiality (potential relatedness or “first determination of order”, in Bradley’s words) to overcome the analog/digital, or continuity/discontinuity ontological impasse, through the conceptualisation of a ‘rhythmic anarchitecture’. The ontological aporia between what  is countable and  what  is unquantifiable, between the continuity of rhythm and the rigid  segmentations of metric,  is solved  by positing a continuum of potentials existing  in-between atomic actualities and allowing them  to relate to each other.
