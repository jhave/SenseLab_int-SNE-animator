The challenging task for both the writer-dancer and the choreographer is to make the dancing subject (or the superject) ‘appear’  through the feeling of movement. From the past (or ‘pastness of experience’) as a field of possibilities, to the emerging of new movement constellations, the collaborative process involves not so much  choreographer and dancer as given presences, but the dance  moving the subject and its own multiple, collaborating selves in time. The emerging of a feeling becomes  a way in which  the qualities of an entity  (in this case the quality of a past, non-conscious or hidden feeling)  are reproduced, or ‘doubled’, to enter the composition of the new (a new movement, a new subject). If the relation between past and future feelings  can never  be said to ‘really’ perish, neither can
it be conceived, despite the absence  of a pre-constituted subject, as a continuous
un-determined flow. It is ‘attracted’ by ideas or eternal objects, potentialities which are not even topological yet (the fluid  contours of topology being already or still anchored to embodiment) but ‘effectual’, like indeterminate tendencies or attractors of determination. Defined by Whitehead in both a subjective and an objective sense, the ‘eternal  object’ corresponds here to a ‘subjective  aim’ taking the place of the dancer as a pre-determined subject. The dancer’s skill therefore does not correspond with  the subjective affirmation of breath-taking virtuosity but with  the capacity to follow and  articulate the ‘message’ of potentiality, in a process  where the subject is as much  destabilised (as the conscious operator of cognitive operations) as it is re-formed (as the carrier  of a thinking-feeling of new movements). At the same time, as Rothfield points out, the same thought-felt movement prolongs itself towards the spectator as another subjectivity yet-to- come. In Alanna Thain’s words, “from  a logic of exposure and distanced
visibility [we arrive]  to one of encounter, feeling and  an otherness at the heart  of
the self that is our openness to the world.”
