Relations are of different degrees of intimacy. Merely  to be ‘with’ one another in a universe of discourse is the most external relation that terms can have,  and seems  to involve nothing whatever as to farther
consequences. (...) Finally, the relation experienced between terms  that form
states  of mind and  are immediately conscious of continuing each other,  (...) the self as a system  of memories, purposes, strivings, fulfilments or disappointments, is incidental to th[e] most intimate of all relations, the terms  of which  seem in many  cases actually to compenetrate and  suffuse each other’s being (James, 1976: 23-24).
