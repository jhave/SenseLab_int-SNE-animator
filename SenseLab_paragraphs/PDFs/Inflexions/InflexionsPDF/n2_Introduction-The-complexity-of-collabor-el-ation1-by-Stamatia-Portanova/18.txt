subjects,  but also the plurality required and implicit  in every subject, which makes  us understand perception, movement and  thought as always already relational acts, combinations and substitutions of more  or less conflicting parts. The individuality of the self is never  ontologically prior  to the relations in which it is involved but always coexistent with  them,  like an atom  which  is not pre- existing  or previously distinct, but always distinguishable, from its molecular relations.
