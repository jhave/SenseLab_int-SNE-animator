At the time of Scatter, I was only just being exposed to ecologists for the  first time—talking with people who work in nature reserves, real conservationists, whose goal is to preserve nature at a certain point in historical time—and to these people invasive weeds are definitely the worst enemy. While I am not going to argue that wiping out species diversity is a good thing, the conservationist idea that nature should more or less stay the same has always been very problematic for me.  A big  part of the reason I don’t want to
associate with the mainstream discourse of sustainability is because arguing that
the way to have a good relationship with the earth is to do as little as possible to it, is to make reductionist and teleological claims about what nature is and how it’s supposed to work. And to me that’s not a satisfying way to be a human in
the world. I have been trying somehow, over the past couple of years starting
with Scatter, to develop a more nuanced sense of what it means to be in the world, to be part of the natural world, to know that it’s impossible to not leave a trace, so instead the traces that are left have to be deliberate and loving, which is not to say that we might not classify them as harmful. There's no way that I'm advocating a new purple loosestrife; I am absolutely not talking about that
scale of disruption. But once these plants are here, it might be better to try
thinking about them in a different way. For example, for the  most part Japanese knotweed is considered an invasive that needs to be wiped out, and in a way it’s kind of true because it messes with the diversity of urban plant life. It
