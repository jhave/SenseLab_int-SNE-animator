In the case of Seeds, it’s a similar format, using the invitation, made up of a set of instructions, as well as an object, and that’s the starting point. But in this case, I am asking people to consider how this seed bomb, this little caked up ball of
clay-powder and compost and seeds, how it is a technology, and how does an engagement with technology change, in a pretty fundamental way, our own spatialized movements and desires. Having a technology like a seed bomb in your hand enables you to do something different in the city.  It not only provides the trajectory of throwing the seed bomb, but it makes you think like a plant, maybe even affecting in a basic way how is it you’re seeing the city  you’re engaged with. In both instances, I would say, those invitations have been far less successful than I would have wanted them to be and it’s partially because the invitation was too polite, and it seems that as an idea it does enough. If people are going to jump in further, the invitation needs to be really sexy,  or you need
to be trickier.  The fact that it’s an invitation can make it too easy to say no.
