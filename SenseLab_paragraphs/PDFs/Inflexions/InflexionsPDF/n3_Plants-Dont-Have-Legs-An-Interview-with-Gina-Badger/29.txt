what ended up happening in the weeks after these little workshops was that everyone’s seedlings died. It was really  opposite to my original intention; it became an exercise in failure and disappointment. Initially, I was horrified that I had caused that to happen but in retrospect I am really  happy to say that that was a totally fine outcome, and the ethics of it are complicated, because instead of people having a nice learning experience, what I gave them was this awful feeling of trauma and guilt. When you  kill something, even if it is a tiny seedling, there’s real disappointment and a sense of having done something wrong. The failure of the workshops almost becomes a separate project, and maybe that’s why  I don’t talk  about it so much when I talk  about Scatter, which is really  the garden. Scatter, which is like le jardin en movement, to steal the
term from Gilles Clément, has really become about creating an intervention into
a living system and then just observing the long-term effects of that intervention. Which brings us to the second part of the question about ethics, concerning the health of ecosystems and ideas about how they do or should change, and the whole alien/indigenous distinction comes up again. There are definitely clear examples of introduced species causing a bunch of ecosystem damage. Plants like purple loosestrife [Lythrum salicaria], Japanese knotweed [Polygonum cuspidatum], or garlic mustard [Alliaria petiolata], which have adaptations that give them a serious competitive edge in a given microclimate, and they are able to establish themselves so well that they choke out other species.
