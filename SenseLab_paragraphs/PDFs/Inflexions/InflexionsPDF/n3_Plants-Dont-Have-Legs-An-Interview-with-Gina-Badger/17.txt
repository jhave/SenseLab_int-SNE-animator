cracca]. I was thinking about the field where Scatter would be as a site where I could intervene in and observe micro-ecological processes. I was asking questions like who are the first plants to arrive when soil is really messed up, and what are they doing to the soil when they’re there? Succession is the process by which ecologies shift over time—plant communities come and go, as they die at the end of a season they decompose and actually create topsoil so that there is more humus for the  next season’s plants, or the plants that were there before have slowly changed nutrients that are in the soil because they have symbiotic relations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, maybe some of them have facilitated chemical processes in the soil that prevent contaminants from remaining bioavailable. Situating this planned garden, as an embodiment of human
desires in a way, was an intervention into the process of succession.  In order to
really  see that part of the process, though, you  have to be willing to wait for a couple of seasons to see if the plants I put there had started to escape the boundaries of the garden. And it did, the plant community has really changed since the garden has been there. And so –
