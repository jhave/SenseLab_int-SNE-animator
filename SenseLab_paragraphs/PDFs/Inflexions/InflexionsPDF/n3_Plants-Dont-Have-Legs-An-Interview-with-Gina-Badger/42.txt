talk  quickly about an aspect of the In the Fall We Plant  Bulbs project, the garlic project. In a way, it shares the same problems with another project, which is called What Kinds of Questions Do Seeds Ask?,  which is a more recent project. In both instances, with both Seeds and Bulbs, there is a pretty tidy little invitation that I present my potential audience with. Bulbs asks people to think about what it is about the city that they love, and to go there, and to be there in a kind of messy, dirt-under-the-fingernails kind of a way. When I hand you the package that’s what I’m asking you  to do—to go get dirty, not just think about it!
