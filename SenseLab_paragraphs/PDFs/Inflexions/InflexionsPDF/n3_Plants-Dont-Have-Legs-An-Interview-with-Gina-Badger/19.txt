GB: Yes, definitely, but it would be ridiculous of me to claim responsibility for it. At one point when I had just planted this garden, I did a full survey of all the plants that were on the site, and there were many different species, but predominately the three I listed before.  I was visiting this week, and now there are a bunch of plants that I didn't see in the beginning: dandelion [Taraxacum officinale], chicory [Chicorium intybus], mullein [Verbascum thapsus], lots more red clover [Trifolium practense] than before, milkweed [Asclepias syriaca], silvery cinquefoil [Potentilla anserina]. I'm pretty sure  that the mullein is there because
of the ones I planted in Scatter. It’s not a controlled experiment, so it’s really
hard to say for sure  what happened. Mullein is a bi-annual, so it’s only this summer that they've turned up. One of the reasons I wanted to put mullein there was that it produces these tiny little seeds, thousands and thousands of them, so there is no way you can’t infect the space when you plant a plant like that.
There was a clearer cross-contamination in the other direction though—even
after the first season. There were goldenrods growing inside the garden that I didn’t plant there. There was a circular section at the bottom of the garden that I left totally empty, and two sumacs [Rhus typhina] self-seeded there. Now they've both grown into little shrubs.
