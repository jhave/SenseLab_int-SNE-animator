GB: Every negotiation of ethics is totally political, and most of what we’ve talked about today touches on that in one way or another. With ethics, as with ecology, I’ve consistently tried to make work that denies fundamental separations between humans and nonhumans.  There are probably two consistent political projects through all of the work we’ve been discussing. The
first is the development and articulation of a radical ecology that incorporates a
much more nuanced, much more honest way of thinking about human engagement in the world.  The second project is summed up by the moment of being explicit about not totally knowing, in which it’s possible to recognize the power of being a learner, and to find ways to share the process of learning in such a way as to create more positions of power.
