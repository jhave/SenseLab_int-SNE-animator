NH: How  would you  re-think the invitation in relation to something that would initiate a more forceful engagement? How  forceful do you think you would want to be in that kind of situation? Because when you were talking about the invitation being a kind of polite formality you leave space there or room to say no, to have the choice to say no, or to not provoke too much a certain type of pre-determined direction, but really  take it up in terms of how you  want to go about experimenting with what you  give. Again, I think that’s really important to think about in terms of ethics, and it’s something I’ve been struggling with in terms of pedagogical practice, how do I foster an environment where participation is necessary for something to take place but being careful about how I am also creating a relation of power.
