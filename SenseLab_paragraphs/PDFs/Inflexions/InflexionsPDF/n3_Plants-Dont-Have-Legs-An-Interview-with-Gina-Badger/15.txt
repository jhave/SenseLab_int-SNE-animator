GB: Yes. I sent out a casual invitation to people I knew. Over a couple of weeks’ time, I would go over to their  houses and we would go through the process of how you start seeds: what’s the growing medium, how moist do they need to be, how much light do they need, all these sorts of questions. Throughout this time I also had seedlings starting in my bedroom.
