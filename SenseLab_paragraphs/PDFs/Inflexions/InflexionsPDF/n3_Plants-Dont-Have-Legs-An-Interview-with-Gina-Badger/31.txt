reproduces rhizomatically and grows in these massive, dense thickets that block out the sun and prevent other plants from growing in its understory.  In another way, ecologists who are more into something  like “disturbance ecology”—that's Peter del Tredici's term for an ecology that takes the urban context and human presence into account and doesn’t try to make equations about what an ecosystem should look like based on the absence of human intervention—will argue that knotweed is great because you can eat it like asparagus in the
spring, and it tastes like rhubarb in pies, and even if it’s a difficult  plant to
eradicate it still performs ecological functions—it’s still absorbing carbon dioxide and exhaling oxygen, and it’s still providing a habitat for bugs. In an urban context, where we’re still struggling to find a roster of green inhabitants that are going to help the city  become a healthier place, knotweed is not so bad, and maybe we can figure out a way to live with it. Anyway, the plants that I work with, as much as they are really aggressive and have pretty impressive capacity to reproduce and move around and sort of colonize areas, already exist in this city,  they’re pretty common. They’ve been here for hundreds of years for the most part.
