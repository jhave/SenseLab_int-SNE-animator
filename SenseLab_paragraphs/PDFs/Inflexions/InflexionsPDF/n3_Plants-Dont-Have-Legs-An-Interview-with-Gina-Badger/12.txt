GB: No. Initially, it started a little further back than Scatter, with another project called Desire and Conquest that looked at the colonial spice trade and the movements of plants involved. I was just having the surprising realization that food and spices are plants. It might seem obvious, but the food we eat is so often divorced from its production process that it can take a while to see that. Realizing that something like a powdered spice originally came from  the seeds of a tropical plant was really  huge for me.  At the same time, I was also beginning to learn field botany. The distinctions between indigenous and non- indigenous plants set off some trips in terms of the linguistic similarities between botanical and human social descriptors.  The language of “alien” or “invasive”
versus “indigenous” has pretty eerie undertones when compared to xenophobic language, not to mention that it betrays a pretty impoverished way of thinking about ecosystems. This obviously brought me to the set of questions that make up Scatter, which was meant to engage a more dynamic sense of ecologies in which humans and nature are not separate, and where it's obvious that ecosystems are always changing over time.
