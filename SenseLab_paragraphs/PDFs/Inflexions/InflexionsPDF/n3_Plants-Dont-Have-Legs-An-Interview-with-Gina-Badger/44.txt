In these two specific instances, I think that is also directly connected to the fact that I presented both Seeds and Bulbs in an art context, where there is this tradition of object creation, and fetishization, artist’s  multiples and free art.  And so I am handing out these little packages with bulbs of garlic in them, and they’re nice little objects, you  know I put time and effort into them, into the way that they look, and in the seed bombs are pleasurable objects that have a good weight, and color, and texture. In both instances people were in love with the ideas to some extent, and they’re also attracted to the object, so it becomes something to hang on to – it passes for an art object in its own right.
So, in a way it doesn’t offer enough and in a way it offers too much of the wrong
thing. I would say those failures seemed more serious than failure of the dead seedlings in Scatter; with the failed invitation the problem is that nothing happens. And so in trying to sort through how to move forward with these projects I’ve got a few thoughts, and two of them are still in their infantile stages and I am not sure how they’re going to work themselves out. One of which is the question of how to make these invitations appear as objects that people don’t want to hold on to; how do I make an object that people don’t want to keep, that’s kind of a repulsive object.

that is to go with an earlier prototype that has really  stinky pelletized chicken
