traditional smarts and centuries of practice with modern scientific data. At first, I studied with Valérie Lanctot Bédard, from an herb school in Montréal, Flora Medicina. They run this amazing week-long field botany course that combines taxonomy and identification skills with a basic introduction to plant medicine.
It’s really  special because you  are outside in the forest. That’s when I learned
about a really  important teaching form for herbalists: the plant walk.  I started learning about plants in these kinds of informal outdoor situations, and I think that this process of hands-on learning acted as a kind of initial enabling force to start doing a similar kind of thing. Plant walks are personalized and improvisational, you combine the knowledge you’ve gained over time with
things that come up as you  go, mixing in anecdotes and so on, and it’s assumed
that the people who are attending also have something to contribute. It ends up being conversational a lot of the time.  It made sense to use Scatter and the Parc sans nom as a teaching tool for this kind of group learning exercise.
