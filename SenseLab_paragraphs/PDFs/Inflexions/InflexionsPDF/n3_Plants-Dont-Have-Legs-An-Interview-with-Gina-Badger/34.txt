NH: Workshops have been part of your  practice, either indirectly or directly. I know you’re interested in practices of pedagogy, and I know you  had mentioned this once before, that the workshop format for you  is very important in terms of how you learn, and how you can also extend yourself to others who want to learn with you. I don’t know if you  have any more thoughts on this, but if you do I want to talk about some of the techniques you have experimented with, or just general thoughts on how you connect pedagogy to your artistic practice. Are they connected? And in some cases if they are, what was the experience of that? Was it a productive outcome?
