an invitation to engage in a learning process. I see this, along with the workshop format, as constituting elaborate invitations to engage. One of the things about an invitation is that it’s quite polite; it’s quite formal and easy to say no to. Recently, I’ve started to think about that critically, in terms of whether it actually works in the way I want. In fact, I am interested in being a little more forceful, in trying to figure out different strategies to get people involved. The form of the invitation is limited because people can chose to take it up or not, and maybe it’s too polite or too complete in itself to be as compelling as I want. By complete I mean that the invitation is received as an idea or a concept that is enough on its own. It doesn’t need to be taken up because it seems like you already get the point. I am interested in trying to find more forceful methods to
illicit participation or engagement, because since this work is about process and
not just ideas, I really want people to engage with me in following through.
