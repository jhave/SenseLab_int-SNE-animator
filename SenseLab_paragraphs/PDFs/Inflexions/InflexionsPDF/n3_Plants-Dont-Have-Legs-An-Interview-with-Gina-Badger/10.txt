GB: The basic structure and trajectory of that project, called Scatter, came about from a couple of different research interests. One of which was the question of how it is that plants move, which is seemingly simple. It’s about weeds, movements of winds, animals, berries, and eating, digestion, and shit. These are all of the seemingly natural ways that plants move around using their seeds. Plants don’t have legs, they move in other ways. But of course, plants don’t live in the world alone with just animals, they live with people. In the beginning, this project was going to be called Leggy because I wanted to emphasize the movement as well as the ways that humans—even though we think that we are following our own economic and political motivations—can end up acting as prosthetics for other things in the world, in this case, plants. So the question of how plants get around is tangled up with these huge movements of imperialism, colonialism, trade—across human history. This is an amazing and complicated relationship, in economic, cultural, and ecological terms. I became really  interested in trying to tell those two histories together— human migrations based on economic and political motivations, specifically European settlers arriving here in Canada, and the migrations of plants that accompany and inform the human movements. I was reading Gananath Obeyesekere on Captain Cook, who traveled with a shipful of plant seeds and domestic animals, and whose project of colonization included domestication in terms of ecologies.  In retrospect, after having worked a lot more with these ideas, I would describe this as an ecology of colonization that considers
colonization as a holistic process, one whose violence can be complicated and
subtle, messed up somewhere between cultural and environmental.
