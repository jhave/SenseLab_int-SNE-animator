Another project, called Plants in Your Pants, which started off as a guerrilla poster installation, eventually turned into a workshop series by the same name, which was an introduction to DIY herbal gynecology. This project was pretty close to my heart, because this area of plant medicine was really what got me interested in botany in the first place. It was pretty clear to me at the time that it could be a sketchy thing to be teaching people something that I was only just learning myself, and so there was a real impetus to try and re-define the question of learning and teaching. Rather than framing myself  as an expert, I would explicitly acknowledge that I was learning too, and that rather than give rigid instructions, I was trying to essentially infect people with a kind of curiosity and drive to learn and teach themselves through this extended process of research and experimentation. In herbal medicine, it’s clear from the start, even or especially with experienced practitioners, that even if you know your plants inside out you are always going to have to experiment when it comes to individuals and their particular conditions. More than rules, this system of knowledge is about observation, attention to detail, and experimentation. So with something like herbal gynecology, the point is not to give people a final solution to their yeast infection, but to offer  an alternative to allopathic medicine, which doesn’t have a whole lot to say about chronic conditions.
