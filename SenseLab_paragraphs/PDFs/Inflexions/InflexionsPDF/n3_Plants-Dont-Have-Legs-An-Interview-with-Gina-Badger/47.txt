GB: I will just keep talking about Jacqueline’s project and hopefully that will clarify it a little bit, if not let me know. She was thinking about group experiences—the example she uses is contagious laughter—where you can’t refuse. You’re swept up in this experience, which you experience subjectively as yourself, but it is a different kind of subjective experience because your capacity to choose has been removed. Our capacity to make choices for ourselves is what defines us as individuals in a liberal sense.  So this messes up that idea of individuality and subjectivity and creates a kind of exploded sense of
subjectivity where you’re at once experiencing something as a group but always through your own sensual experience as an individual. Jacqueline was using the physical phenomenon of laughter as a way to talk about that kind of subjectivity, an infectious hybrid of collective individual-collective subjectivity. I was really taken by the project, and it helped along my own ideas around contagion, which are still incubating. Conceptually, it’s always been important in terms of seeds and weeds and uncontrolled growth and all that, but I’m still not sure how to incorporate it as a methodology. In a way, pretending that my projects are just polite invitations is just pretending anyway. Because in fact I do want to people to at least begin engaging in a specific way. The point about being more forceful is just more honest, because pretending to be polite is
maybe just obscuring the fact that I am asking that we begin on my terms. In this
case, there is a power relation and paradoxically the ethics of it make more sense when it’s more extreme. That seems like an important strategy, but not instead of the more open participation of workshops and group knowledge production. They both seem really important to me as ways to move out of the failure of the invitations.
