truly “weird” forms of life (Cleland and Chyba 2007; Sterelny and Griffths 1999), from Earth-bound extremophiles (Rothschild and Mancinelli 2001), to other, non- terrestrial, living chemistries. In other words, the constant conjunction of life and biomaterials and functionalities is inherently limited by human perspective. In this view, any attempt at reproducing life — via biotechnological mediation, for example — based on a biocentric metric cannot help but reproduce anthropocentric criteria for the living, and may capture certain living processes associated with biological systems, but certainly not life as such.
