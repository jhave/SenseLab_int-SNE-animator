Experimental architect and co-founder of The Living (http://www.thelivingnewyork.com/), David Benjamin, has been actively working with synthetic biologists and has been developing architectural pedagogy around such transdisciplinary collaborations. In short, he is thinking about how the standardization of biological parts, or the “BioBricks” model, may be transferred to the architectural context, so that biological parts, such as promoters (e.g. phage promoters), terminators (e.g., bacterial, yeast, and eukaryotic), and so on, may be assembled as systems for architectural application (http://biobricks.org/). This is analogous to the way different circuits are constructed in electrical engineering from different parts, following what is known as the “abstraction hierarchy” in engineering: there are parts designers and device and system designers. The application potential of this biotechnology increases substantially using this hierarchy, since you do not need to be a specialist in the chemistry to design an effective system (Cf. 2010: 83-88).
