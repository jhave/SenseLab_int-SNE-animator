While using biomedia for design implies an incredible range of new performance capacities for designed systems, what is often sidestepped in this excitement is how life becomes “important” for the design practice. In what way does architecture’s use of synthetic biology, along with its concomitant computational practices,  make  life  matter  for  it?  While  it  would  be  unfair  to  say  that  all architects working with synthetic biology are directly interested in “life defnitionism,” [17] it would be equally unfair to overlook how advancements in biotechnological application — most notably, BioBricks and its associated synthetic biological practices — have renewed hope in fulflling Frazer ’s dream of a living architecture: to grow buildings with biomaterials. While Frazer admits that “it is [their] intention that the form-making process will be part of the system…” (1995: 99), this intention now seems realizable, at least in part, with the incorporation of biochemical materials, the “building blocks” of biological life. Hensel, for example, notes that,
