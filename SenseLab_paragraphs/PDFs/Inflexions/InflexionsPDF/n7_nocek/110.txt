This is a very interesting article, on the necessity of a broader defnition of the concept of life, and of the attention for what we defne, and do not defne, as life, particularly in relation to the emerging form of architectural design that relies on biotechnologies or biomedia. I am taking this occasion to suggest a few points that could help the author clarify and strengthen their already original, well researched and theoretically signifcant  piece of work. The points that need correction or clarifcation are marked in the text. Basically there are just a few points that might gain from a better explanation or clarifcation and, more in detail, I think the text would gain in linearity and fluidity if the use of commas could be more carefully considered.
