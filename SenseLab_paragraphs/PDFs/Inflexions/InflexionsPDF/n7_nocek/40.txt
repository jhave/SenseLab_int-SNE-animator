With Frazer ’s adjustment, emphasis falls off of the production of one optimal solution, and is redirected onto the “production of a population that has learned to respond in an appropriate way to particular inputs” (59). To facilitate this computationally, “classifer systems” are implemented alongside generic algorithms   in   order   to   account   for   how   a   system   perceives   its   current environment — as a “structural coupling” (103) [6] — and then generates an output that is positively or negatively fed back into the code-script. [7] Frazer considers this process closer to a living organism’s ability to learn and respond to the changing nature problems in the environment than it is to optimization:
