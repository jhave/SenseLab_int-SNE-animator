Of course, Whitehead’s association of life with novelty is far from a new one. Didier Debaise, for example, sees resonances in Whitehead’s construction with C.S. Pierce’s proposal that life is ubiquitous because novelty is ubiquitous in “The Doctrine of Necessity Examined (1892).” [29] Although the important difference is that Whitehead is not doing “Nature philosophy,” where life and nature are identifed (in physis). In this register, what requires explanation is not so much life, but its derivations, or stabilizations in such a way that? “it should be possible to explain novelty as well as repetition by the same principle” (Debaise 2007: 58). This is decidedly not what Whitehead is up to. “Life” and “tradition” are distinguished in his metaphysical scheme; but the challenge is to do so without letting nature bifurcate, as if there was inert “tradition,” on the one hand, and creative “life,” on the other.
