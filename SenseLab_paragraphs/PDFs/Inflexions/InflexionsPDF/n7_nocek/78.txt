What’s compelling is that Whitehead and Thacker seem to fnd very different solutions to a similar problem: the contradiction that pervades “nature” does not warrant its wholesale rejection, for Whitehead, but rather demands deeper “interpretation” (1978: 3). Where Thacker ’s nihilism may have once seemed like a  bold  gesture,  surprisingly,  Whitehead’s  proposal,  now  more  than  seven decades old, to move beyond contradiction and construct a concept that can put “all of nature in the same boat,” seems more daring, or at any rate, involves more risk.

And yet Whitehead’s fallibilism does not spell metaphysical ruin or weakness, but is a hallmark of his
