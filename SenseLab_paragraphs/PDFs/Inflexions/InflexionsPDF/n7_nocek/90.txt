In his series of lectures, Pragmatism, James notes that, “the truth of an idea is not a stagnant property inherent to it. Truth happens to an idea. It becomes true, is made true by events. Its verity is in fact an event, a process…” (James 2008: 87). To see the James in Whitehead means to see how the latter ’s well-known, though no less troubling, proposition that actual occasions are the “Final Realities, or Res Verae” (1987: 22) is not a pre-existent truth [28]; its truth is an event determined by the experience produced. Speculative concepts are abstract materials that individuate experiences, generate them, so that a notion’s truth is a consequence of the production of an experience that resists the bifurcation of nature. Thus, if “life,” as Whitehead will claim in Process and Reality, “is the name for originality, and not for tradition” (1978: 104), then this must become true; its verity rests, in other words, on its capacity to produce a non-bifurcating experience, and not on whether         it         represents         a         life         that         pre-exists         it.
