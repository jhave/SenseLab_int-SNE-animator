Form-fnding   computation  makes  possible  a  new  parallelism  between architecture and soft artifcial life; but this only tells half of the story of architecture’s becoming “alive”: advances in mathematics and computer science have more recently been supplemented by advances in biotechnology and synthetic biology. This biotechnological turn responds to what some architects had begun to suspect was merely self-indulgent, digital form-generation that neglected the material pressures of the built environment. Michael Hensel and Achim Menges, for example, are critical of much of what has emerged from computational architectures and insist on the need to return to material and construction logics. They put it this way:
