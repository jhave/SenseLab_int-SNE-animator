There are certainly many reasons to praise this animated short. Not only did it win Best Animated Short at SIGGRAPH 2002 in San Antonio, but in 2002 it was also nominated for the Academy Award for Animated Short Film. My interest here however is more thematic than technical. I want to suggest that the flm presents  a  model  for  “living  architecture”  that  is  deeply  ecological  in  scope insofar as the structure’s vitality is dependent upon the interpenetration of multiple scales of experience – human, built, cosmic, etc. – the effects of which far
exceed what seems possible in the built environment on Earth.
