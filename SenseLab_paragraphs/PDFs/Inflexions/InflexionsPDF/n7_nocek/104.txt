For biotechnological architecture, specifcally, life is no longer an objectively defned property (a tradition) that may be more or less reproduced within material systems. Rather, life acts as “lure for feeling” (as Whitehead calls all speculative propositions, cf. 1978: 25) the material systems designed and engineered by biotechnological architecture (biomaterial systems) as embedded within a much larger ecology of systems (biological, chemical, technological, social, political, etc.) that each have their own relative degrees of flexibility, capacities for adaptation, and so on. So although biomaterials may be extremely useful media for architectural design (including phage promoters, yeast, genetically engineered bacteria, and the inorganic chemistries of the protocell), to isolate them because they possess a defning property called “life,” is to reproduce, I would even say, a politically suspect hierarchy (an exclusionary tactic  that  resonates  with  the  thanatopolitical  declensions  of  biopolitics  –  cf.
