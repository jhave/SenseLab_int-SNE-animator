[12] Hensel and Menges go on to suggest that the “logic of computation strongly suggests such an alternative, in which the geometric rigor and simulation capability  of  computational  modeling  can  be  deployed  to  integrate manufacturing constraints, assembly logics and material characteristics” (2008a:
56). This means that the potentials for biological design, or even (artifcially)
living design, are extended further still, from digital form generation, to actual building performance and behavior. The logic of this digital-material biodesign unfolds, then, not by trading one for the other, the immaterial world of digitization for the concrete world of material sciences, but through a synthesis of the two; a design program “that derives morphological complexity and performative capacity without differentiating between form-generation and materialization processes” (56).
