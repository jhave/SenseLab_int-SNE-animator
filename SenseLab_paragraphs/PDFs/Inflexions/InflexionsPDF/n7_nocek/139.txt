2002: 231-233). Although Whitehead claims that actual occasions are the “Res Verae” (Whitehead 1978: 22), this is not to say that occasions are the new subatomic particles, that is to say, the new ultimate bits of reality that we may one day discover; this would bifurcate nature, relegating certain experiences to irrelevancy. Occasions do not pre-exist their philosophic construction. They are abstractions from experience that serve the purpose of transforming experience. In this regard, Whitehead is far indeed from the pre-Kantian dogmatism of which he has often been accused. Isabelle Stengers has done important work dispelling this myth in her Thinking with Whitehead (2011).
