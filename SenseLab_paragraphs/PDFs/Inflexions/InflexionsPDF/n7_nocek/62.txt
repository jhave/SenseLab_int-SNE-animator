To put the isolation of life in a biopolitical register, it is through the deployment of very specifc techniques and strategies (the exact nature of which have yet to be cased out) that computational and biological technologies are mobilized in order for architecture to become a privileged site for reproducing normative content for the living. Without discrediting how various technological interventions facilitate the performance of living processes at non-standard scales (cf., Hensel 2006a; Weinstock 2008), architectural form generation does not escape the normative reproduction of living systems. My concern here, then, is not tha architecture   borrows   from   the   biological,   engineering,   and   computational sciences. Rather, what worries me is that life acquires “importance” for architecture only insofar as it is normatively reproduced. A number of questions follow from this: does this reproduction exhaust the feld of the living? Are there other architectural uses of biotechnology in which life acquires a more robust (or non-normative) sense of importance? Or does life’s importance for biotechnological architecture still require inventing?
