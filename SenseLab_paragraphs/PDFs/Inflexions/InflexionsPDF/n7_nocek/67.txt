In a recent issue of Architectural Design, Neil Spiller and Rachel Armstrong advocate the use of protocell technology for architectural research and development (Spiller and Armstrong 2011). While protocell technology is often associated with bottom-up synthetic biology, or wet ALife, whose goal is the synthesis of life de novo (Rasmussen et al. 2009; Bedau and Parke 2009), as an applied science in architecture, there is decidedly less emphasis on the synthesis of biological life as such, and more on the exploration of living processes. To this end, Spiller and Armstrong are indebted to the protocell research of Martin Hanczyc in his lab at the Institute for Physics and Chemistry at the University of Southern Denmark. In 2007 Hanczyc and his colleagues created a protocell using oil and water based chemistry that achieves dynamic motility (chemiotaxis) by remodeling its own chemical environment to generate the conditions (PH gradient) for motility (Hanczyc et al. 2007). These protocells are thought to be primitive metabolisms, sensing and transforming their environments.
