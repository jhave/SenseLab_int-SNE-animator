[9] Proponents of strong ALife believe that artifcial  life systems, whether soft, hard, or wet, are actually alive (Langton 2003), while proponents of weak ALife believe that the systems merely simulate life processes. For a thorough analysis of the differences through the lens of ‘functionalism’ in philosophy of mind, see Elliot Sober ’s “Learning from Functionalism: Prospects for Strong Artifcial Life” (2003). Bioarchitects themselves seem divided on this point. Following Frazer, Una-May O’Reilly, Ian Ross, and Peter Testa of MIT’s Emergence and Design seem  to  make  the  case  for  a  strong  ALife  program:  cf.,  “Emergent  Design: Artifcial Life for Architecture Design”(2000); while designers and theorists such as Greg Lynn, Alisa Andrasek, Jenny Sabin, Roland Snooks, among many others, would simply make the case that they use biocomputing to explore living processes and not necessarily that they’re synthesizing life as such.
