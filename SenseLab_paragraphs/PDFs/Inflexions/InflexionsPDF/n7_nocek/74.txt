It is no wonder, then, that some theorists, such as Evelyn Fox Keller, question whether there is any defnition  of life that will not be inherently limited by human perspective (Keller 2002: 265-294). Edouard Machery has recently argued that the sciences of life will always come up short on the problem of “life defnitionism,” and so it is useless to continue trying to defne it (Machery 2012). And in a slightly different register, by drawing on the philosophy of life from Aristotle to Kant, but also including the neo-vitalisms of Deleuze and Guattari, among others inspired by Spinoza, Eugene Thacker compellingly argues that life is  a  contradictory  concept,  and  so  what  we  need  now  more  than  ever  is  a “critique of life” (Thacker 2010). Thacker ’s recent efforts have been touted as contributing to the popularity of speculative realism, materialism, and even nihilism in the continental tradition, arguably united by a critique of what Quentin Meillassoux identifes as “correlationism,” or the idea according to which, ever since Kant, we never have knowledge of an object as it is in-itself, our knowledge is always correlated to a subject.
