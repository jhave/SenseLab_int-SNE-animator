In  this  register,  all  defnitions   of  life  are  fundamentally  limited  by  their correlation to a subject, and so any architecture that commits itself to either the biotechnological reproduction or non-reproduction – as in the case of protocell architecture – of life by means of objective criteria is bound to run up against the conditions (whatever they may be – subjective, cultural, historical, etc.) for the emergence of the criteria. Of course Whitehead had already warned us that our scientifc abstractions are fated to become contradictory when pushed to their limit: recall that “in science you have only to develop your argument suffciently, and sooner or later you are bound to arrive at a contradiction, either internally within the argument, or externally in its reference to fact.” And that suffcient limit is a reference to “the myth of the fnite fact”: that there could be a matter-of-
