[2] In their introduction to AD Versatility and Vicissitude: Performance in Morpho- ecological Design,” Menges and Hensel suggest that we replace the tired rhetoric of “sustainability” with a more dynamic set of concepts, such as versatility and vicissitude: the former describing the behavior and performance of an organism, or building, in a context, the latter describing the “differentiation of the object and  the  dynamic  of  the  environment”  (Hensel  and  Menges  2008:  7).  And
‘ecology’ captures the dynamic relation between organism/building and environment — hence a new paradigm: morpho-ecological design.
