applicability  of  the  system.  Whitehead  writes  that,  applicability  “means  that some items of experience are thus interpretable, and [adequacy] means that there are no items incapable of such interpretation” (Whitehead 1978: 3). Suffce it to say here that the rational requires experience for its verifcation; its truth is dependent on whether it can transform experience so that any item of experience is affrmed  in terms that do not reduce any experiences to irrelevancy.
