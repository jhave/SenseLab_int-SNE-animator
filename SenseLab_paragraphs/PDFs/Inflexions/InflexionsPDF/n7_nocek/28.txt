What Whitehead is getting at here in these late lectures is of course nothing short of a metaphysical overhaul of what we take to be “important” in any experience; or more specifcally, what counts as relevant data in the emergence of “matters- of-fact.” As will be shown, where the defnition of life is concerned, the life sciences generally reduce it (life) to an essential set of material and functional properties, relegating all other factors, or experiences, to what are inessential properties.  This  is  not  to  say  that  identifying   such   (material/functional) properties is not necessary for the integrity of the scientifc practice (this is why Whitehead is not “Critical” in the Kantian sense of the term, since he does not think we should renounce these abstractions as mere illusions [c.f. Whitehead
1967: 59]). Rather, so long as science neglects how the existence of its matters-of-
fact result from the gradation of the totality of environmental factors, or in any case, how the universe is coordinated for them, then it supports the “myth of fnite facts” and suppresses the “environmental coordination required for its existence” (Whitehead 1966: 9-10).
