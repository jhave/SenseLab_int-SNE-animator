In many ways, this is the contradiction that Thacker articulates in his compelling, After Life: life is at once “out there,” or “in-itself” and “in here, or “for us.” Life is a contradiction, in Thacker ’s estimation, and so demands a “critique,” which results in an ontology of life that is radically nihil (Thacker 2011: 266). Of course Whitehead is aware that you cannot separate what’s in-itself from what’s for-us in our consideration of natural phenomena. It is the denial of their constant conjunction, in fact, that produces what he spent the majority of his career trying to overcome: the bifurcation of nature. But whereas Thacker calls for the revival of radical nothingness, in The Concept of Nature, Whitehead takes the opposite tack by adding to our abstractions. He endeavors to construct a concept of nature that accounts for all that we are aware of in perception, both primary and secondary  qualities,  in  order  to  resist  the  tendency  of  modern  thought  to bifurcate nature “into two systems of reality, which, insofar as they are real, are real in different senses . . .” (Whitehead 1964: 30). Although the demands of such a project have yet to be cashed out (and transform throughout his career), what’s signifcant for us here, in any case, is that Whitehead takes on board precisely what   Thacker   claims   cannot   be:   the   subjective   and   objective   nature   of phenomena, in order that  “all we know of nature is in the same boat, to sink or swim together” (1964: 148).
