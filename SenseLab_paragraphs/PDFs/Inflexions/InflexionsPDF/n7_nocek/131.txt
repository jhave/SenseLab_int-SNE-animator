And yet,  such  innovation  is  not uncommon  in  the feld  of  synthetic biology.  The yearly undergraduate (and now including high school) synthetic biology competition, iGem (International Genetically Engineered Machine), testifes both to  the  ubiquity  of  innovation  (not  simply  professional  scientists),  and  the potential for far-reaching impacts of this technology. That iGem exists at all, that high school students are so easily able to manipulate DNA, raises any number of ethical questions about how to manage the risks of biohacking, bioterrorism, and national security with the rise of “amateur” or “citizen” scientists (http://diybio.org/),  without  being  alarmist  and  needlessly  impeding innovation.
