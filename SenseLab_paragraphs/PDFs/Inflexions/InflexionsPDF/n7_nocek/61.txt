techniques: as what requires metabolism, reproduction, and self-maintenance; but with new biotechnological tools, life has become “materially” isolated as well: a fnite set of biological parts that may be re-purposed for the design of an effective living system. With the twin advances in computation and biotechnology, what architectural design has gained in terms of technological application and flexibility it has also lost in terms of the elasticity of what living systems can be. So while architecture helps to extend the implications of what Melinda Cooper calls the, “destandardization of living systems,” [18] exploring how  they  may  be  repurposed  at  new  and  exciting  scales  with  surprising functions, life is nevertheless materially and functionally isolated, which introduces objective criteria for what counts as life.
