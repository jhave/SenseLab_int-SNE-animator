bifurcation of nature. The poet’s musings about his or her experiences of the sunset are no more and no less essential to experience than the physicist’s explanations of why s/he has these experiences. We tend to bifurcate all that we are aware of in experience by over-exaggerating the importance of certain abstractions at the expense of others; this is a modern habit of thought that Whitehead calls the “Fallacy of Misplaced Concreteness” (Whitehead 1967: 51).
