Thus, for many architects working under the banner of bioarchitecture, a “material turn” is underway; a return from what are deemed to be the mere functional performances of life in silico, to its material components, to its wet synthesis using biological materials as new media for design. [13] According to Hensel, this signals a true biological paradigm for architecture. Broadly, the idea is that in order to synthesize life, at whatever scale, one must work from its constituent parts, its “building blocks.” By returning to the molecular materials of life, to its very chemical supports, architecture aims to become biochemical and not simply digital-computational: [14]
