Of course in Whiteheadian terms, every system has its unique way of incorporating other environments. The way a protocell society maintains itself nested within the incredibly diverse societies of an architectural site is, for example, different from the way a staphylococcal (Staph) species of bacteria sustains itself within the larger society of the human body. These are differences we should celebrate in Whitehead’s view, but without reducing them to differences in nature or kind as a consequence of exaggerating the impact of any one set of abstractions. [38] In this respect, there is not an isolatable Bio- or Nature- Thing in Whitehead since all systems are “instances of a general scheme” (1978: 3). [39] Whiteheadian philosophy is a critique of “Nature” in this regard. What this also means is that the “Natural” order is not something that could be differentiated from, as protocell architecture often tries to do. “Unnatural” evolution is only justifed to the extent that it is a critique of over exaggerating the importance of the “Nature” abstraction (“mistaking the abstract for the concrete” (1967: 51)), not because it has produced a more “accurate” abstraction; to assume this, according to Whitehead, would enfeeble thought yet again.
