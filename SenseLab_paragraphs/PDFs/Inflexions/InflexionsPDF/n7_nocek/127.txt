[13] Very broadly, there are parallels between the “material turn” in architecture and the “material/real turn” in recent continental philosophy. In philosophy, the return to the real and/or material is associated, most commonly, with a move away from what Quentin Meillassoux has called, “correlationism,” or the idea according to which, since Kant, there is no object without a subject— they are correlated (cf. Meillassoux 2008). In architecture, there is also a move away from computation  as  sole  media  of  generative  design  (purely  in  silico),  and  an embrace of the complex material ecologies of design. See for instance, Michael Hensel,  Defne  Sunguroglu,  and  Achim  Menges’  “Material  Performance”  in which they consider the performance capacities of wood and argue that it should be considered a “smart material.” Also consider Neri Oxman’s work on what she calls the “material ecology” of architecture in “Structuring Materiality: Design Fabrication  of  Heterogeneous  Materials.”  There  have  also  been  a  number  of
