To return, if only briefly, to the short flm that I used to introduce this article, organic interdependency is precisely what biomimetic interpretations of the Cathedral miss: whatever vitality the cathedral may possess does not derive from a singular property that it possesses, but from an entire ecology of nested environments (from the travellers staff to the planetary movements) that are anything but passive. Dollens may be right that The Cathedral is an important model for thinking about “bio” architecture, but it is “important” only insofar as its  “bio”  materials  participate  in  a  complex  ecology  in  which  vitality  is distributed throughout.
