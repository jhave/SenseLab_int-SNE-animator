[33] Very basically, an eternal object is meant to account for the potential forms of defniteness that are actualized in an occasion’s concrescence. In other words, in one occasion’s prehension of another, there is no direct causal transfer (effcient causality); the occasion must select from the infnite ways of potentially feeling another entity enter in its own constitution. These “pure potentials” are called “eternal objects,” precisely in order to emphasize how potentials are never exhausted by their actualization in temporal occasions (cf. 1978: 22).
