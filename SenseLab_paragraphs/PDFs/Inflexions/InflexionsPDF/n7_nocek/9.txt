This bio-reductionism should really come as no surprise, however. It’s not as if architecture is a stranger to the concept of biological life, to digital media, and using the latter to promote the former. As I explore in this article, the concept of biological  life  is  intimately  connected  to  architecture  through  the  latter ’s experimentation with new media for design. To this end, I suggest that the emergence of what Michael Hensel calls, the “biological paradigm” in architecture, results from a whole series of discursive overlaps and slippages that facilitate the use of computational and biochemical media in architectural design. These media then prepared the way for architecture to become a species of artifcial life (ALife), whose aim is to reproduce both the functional and materials properties of life at a “non-standard” scale.
