This, at any rate, is the constructivist method to which I now turn in order that life may acquire a new mode of importance for biotechnological architecture. The challenge for this new strategy, of course, is resisting the “habit of thought” that divides life into essential and inessential properties, and thus reproduces the bifurcation  of  nature  that  Whitehead’s  constructivism  sought  to  avoid.  As Isabelle Stengers insists in her Thinking With Whitehead, this bifurcating habit is insidious and is certainly not restricted to the sciences but pervades all modern thinking, from the inaccessibility of Kant’s “thing-in-itself” to Bergson’s duration that replaces science’s spatializing abstractions; in each of these cases, “philosophy destroys its usefulness,” according to Whitehead, by “indulg[ing] in brilliant feats of explaining away” (1978: 17). Thus, if life is going to acquire a rigorous sense of importance for biotechnological design, it will have to do so by means of a non-bifurcating mode of valuation. It is in order to understand the means for constructing this mode that I now turn to the specifcs of Whitehead’s philosophic method.
