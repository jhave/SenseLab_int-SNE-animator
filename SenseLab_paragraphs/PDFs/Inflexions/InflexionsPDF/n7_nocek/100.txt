What follows from this is that a society, a biological society for example, “is only to be termed living in a derivative sense,” since it depends upon “the prevalence in it of living occasions” (1978: 102). But since there are no occasions that do not introduce some degree of novelty into the world, an “occasion may be more or less living according to the relative importance of novel factors in its fnal satisfaction” (102). This means that, “there is no absolute gap between ‘living’ and ‘nonliving’ societies” (102); there is always life lurking within social orders. It is true of course that some social reproductions require more inventiveness than others. The fact that the Triops cancriformis, or the tadpole shrimp, one of the oldest living species, has reproduced itself for so long in an ever-changing environment,  testifes   both  to  the  insistence  of  a  tradition,  but  also  to  its incredible capacity for adaptation, for originality, for the inventiveness of life. But to use biological life as the criteria for life is to introduce a difference in kind or nature between social orders, when there is, for Whitehead, only a difference in degree – “more or less ‘living’” (102).
