It would seem logical and necessary to also include the molecular scale, which  promises   to   yield   a   functionality   of   an   as   yet unrealised extent and to make possible advanced performativity and sustainability. Such an approach would involve biochemistry, the discipline concerned with the study of molecules and their chemistry in reactions that facilitate the processes that make living systems possible (Hensel 2006a: 19).
