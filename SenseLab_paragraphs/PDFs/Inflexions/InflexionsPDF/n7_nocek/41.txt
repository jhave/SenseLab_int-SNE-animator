A Classifer system receives information from the environment, the information is checked against conditional rules (classifers),  and the rules are acted upon in order to output to the environment. This linking of detection, internal processing of information, and action is regarded as analogous to an organism perceiving information from the environment, thinking about it, and acting on it. If the action produced is effective, the organism receives some pay-off or reward, and this implementation of success is modelled in implementations of classifer systems (59).
