[30] Whitehead’s three-fold doctrine of prehension counters the tradition of substantialist metaphysics. Whitehead asks: “how can … other actual entities, each with its own formal existence, also enter objectively into the perspectival constitution of the actual entity in question? … The classical doctrines of universals and particulars, of subject and predicate, of individual substances not present in other individual substances … alike render this problem incapable of solution. The answer given by the organic philosophy is the doctrine of prehensions, involved in concrescent integrations, and terminating in a defnite, complex unity of feeling” (Whitehead 1978: 56). See Judith A. Jones’ Intensity: An Essay in Whiteheadian Ontology (1998), for one of the best available works on the interpenetration  of  actual  entities  in  Whitehead’s  metaphysics;  it  challenges much  of  the  classical  Whiteheadian  scholarship  (Leclerc,  Christian,  Ford)  in which a sharp, ontological distinction exists between subject and superject, by proposing a more “ecstatic interpretation,” where there is no absolute distinction
—or ontological dualism—between superject and subject.
