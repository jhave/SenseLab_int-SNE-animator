And yet, for all the creative advance Whitehead affrms, an occasion cannot become anything at all. An occasion cannot completely outgrow its own environment, since it is an outgrowth of its environment. The antecedent world, the objectifed world of past occasions, determines, to a large extent, what an occasion can become. There is order in the world of the occasion that limits its possible satisfaction. Order does not necessarily have a negative connotation in Whiteheadâ€™s view, though: in the right proportion, it allows the occasion to have a greater intensity of satisfaction for itself and for the future.
