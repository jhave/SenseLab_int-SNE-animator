no coordination among the datum, then in Whitehead’s words, the synthesis of the datum will be “trivial,” arising from “lack of coordination in the factors of the datum, so that no feeling arising from one factor is reinforced by any feeling arising from another factor” (1978: 111). But if, on the other hand, there is an excess of coordination among the datum, so that there is too much identity in the world of the concrescing occasion, then there is “vagueness,” or an excess of narrowness over width in the data synthesized, so that “the contrasts between the various objectifcations are faint, and there is defciency in supplementary feeling discriminating the objects from each other” (111). An intense satisfaction therefore arises from the proper dosage of order and disorder in the world of the occasion: too much order, the satisfaction is too narrow and has vagueness; too much disorder, the satisfaction is too wide and has trivial value. The right dosage of order and disorder is the condition for intensity of satisfaction.
