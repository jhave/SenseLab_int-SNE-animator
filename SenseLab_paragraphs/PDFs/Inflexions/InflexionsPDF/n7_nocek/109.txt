decades. But this is not a challenge that generates a more exhaustive concept of life itself; rather, it is a challenge to our habits of thought. “Life is novelty” is a speculative proposition in Whitehead’s view. Its “importance” derives from the fact that it is a “lure for feeling” that is neither true nor false in itself; rather, it is a mediation capable of transforming the way the world is felt (1978: 191, 197). The proposition of life transforms our habits of thought, our thinking societies, and introduces interstices within these well-worn habits. Living architecture does not therefore signal a thought-independent state of affairs, a pre-existent world, or even a speculative project that could one day be built. Rather, life’s importance derives from its capacity to “lure” us into regarding architecture’s biomedia as immanently connected to all other singular achievements of order-disorder. In this way, life is abstract media that encourages us to regard the biomaterials of biotechnological design ecologically framework; but this is only on condition that thought can itself be “lured” into injecting a different dosage of disorder, or life, into its habits.
