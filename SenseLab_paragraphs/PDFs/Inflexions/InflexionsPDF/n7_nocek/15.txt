In the natural world, form and metabolism have a very different relationship [than in the history of built architecture]. There is an intricate choreography of energy and material that determines the morphology of living forms, their relations to each other, and which drives  the  self-organisation  of  populations  and  ecological systems…  The  study  of  natural  metabolisms  is  a  signifcant resource for design as it reveals that shape or morphology is deeply integrated within the means of capturing and transmitting energy. The organisation and morphology of energy systems of the natural world  provide  a  set  of  models  for  what  will  become  the  new
‘metabolic morphologies’ of future buildings, and ultimately of cities (2008: 27).
