[38] It may seem that the Whiteheadian argument for life is subject to what Cary Wolfe, in his monograph, Before the Law, identifes as the problem with the radical “equality” of life – from humans to microbes – that is prevalent in the affrmative biopolitics of Roberto Esposito. On Wolfe’s reading, insofar as the principle of life functions as an equalizing force that forbids any normative criteria of exclusion
—since every form of life expresses a life, or as Esposito writes, “every life is a
form of life and every form refers to life” (Esposito 2008: 194) —there is no essential basis on which to found exclusion. There is radical equality in the plurality of expressions – from microbes to humans. The problem with this view, especially when framed in these terms, is on the hand, philosophical: a life is not itself  “living,”  it  is  never  “Life-in-itself”  (a  criticism  that  invokes  Eugene Thacker ’s critique of Deleuze’s vitalism, where life is never “in itself”); and on the other hand, practical: it rehearses all those tired debates of deep ecology that, in Wolfe’s view, exposes the problem of placing equal value on all forms of life: “As Tim Lukes notes, if all forms of life are given equal value, then we face questions such as the following: ‘Will we allow anthrax or cholera microbes to attain self-realization in wiping out sheep herds or human kindergartens?’” (Wolfe 2013: 59). And even if there were those who proclaimed, “Yes! Let cholera express itself, even if it means human death,” this still doesn’t resolve the biopolitical problem since, demographically, poor populations of colour would be the ones to suffer the most, producing, yet again, a non-equivalence in life. This is precisely the kind of criticism that Whitehead avoids, since life is not in the service of valuing organisms – or societies – but is precisely what lurks within them, and is what even “robs” from them. Hence, Whitehead’s famous proclamation, “life is robbery” (Whitehead 1978: 105), is far indeed from valuing every form of equally.
