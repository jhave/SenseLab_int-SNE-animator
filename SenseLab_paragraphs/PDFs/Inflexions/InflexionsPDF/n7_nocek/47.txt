process. The suppleness of that form makes the process noncomputational, but a computer simulation of life can create real life“ (Bedau 1998: 130). This means, as Bedau continues, that life “cannot occur unless it is realized in some material, and although it cannot be realized in just any kind of material, the range of materials which can realize it seems quite open-ended” (134). It’s hard to say whether all architects working under the auspices of “evolutionary” or “bio” architecture using form-fnding  computation would make the strong claim to artifcial  life (strong ALife) that Frazer seems to— instead, that is, of the weak claim (weak ALife) that architecture simulates but doesn’t synthesize life.  [9] What  is  nevertheless  clear  is  that  generative  computation  allows  the reproduction of biological life to become a new horizon for architectural design. [10]
