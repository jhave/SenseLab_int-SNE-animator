These  other  categories,  then,  elaborate  the  coherence  of  Whitehead’s philosophical system (through generic notions such as actual occasions, eternal objects, prehension, and so on), and specify how “the many become one, and are increased by one” (1978: 21). For the purposes of our discussion, what matters is that an actual occasion (the frst of the eight categories of existence) is what it is because of its integration of other actual entities. “It lies in the nature of things,” writes Whitehead, “that the many enter into a complex unity” (31). And yet each occasion, as a space-time quantum of experience, doesn’t simply repeat the past but is a defnite  and unique integration of the totality of the past. Whitehead must therefore explain how an actual entity is able to integrate all other entities
—the many becomes one—while also becoming a novel one.
