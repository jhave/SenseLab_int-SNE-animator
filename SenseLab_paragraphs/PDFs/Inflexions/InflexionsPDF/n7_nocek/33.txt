Holland, in many ways the inheritor of John von Neumann’s incomplete work on reproducing computers (or programs), once quipped that, “that’s where genetic algorithms came from. I began to wonder if you could breed programs the way people would say, breed good horses and breed good corn.” (Mitchell
2009:  128). With the genetic algorithm (GA), Holland discovered an effective
means for generating solutions to optimization problems. The GA simulates the behavior  and  adaptation  of  randomly  generated  candidate  solutions  over  a period of time. Each generation of “individuals” is evaluated based on a ftness function; it is then selected for, combined with other ft individuals to be parents of the next generation (with the chance of random mutation), and so on until a solution is arrived at (cf. 129; Terzidis 2006: 19). What is critical is that the algorithm performs the process of natural selection irrespective (in principle) of
