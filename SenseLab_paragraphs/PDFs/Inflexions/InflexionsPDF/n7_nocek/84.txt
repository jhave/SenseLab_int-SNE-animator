Whitehead, though, is careful not to confuse our overvaluation of certain abstractions with the need to overcome all abstractions — as is the case with Bergson’s “method of intuition,” for example. “We cannot think without abstractions,” Whitehead explains in Science and the Modern World, so we must be “vigilant in critically revising [our] modes of abstraction” (1967: 59). He places emphasis on our modes of abstraction here, not in order to “critique” abstraction as such – there are no unmediated experiences for Whitehead [25] — but in order to critique how we regard our abstractions, that is, the importance we give to them,  so  that “all  we  know of  nature  is  in  the  same  boat, to  sink  or  swim together” (1964: 148). To do this, speculative philosophy must create abstractions, or “speculative propositions,” that “lure” us into feeling our world differently (1978: 187,197), that lure us into experiencing our abstractions in such a way that there are no abstractions that are reduced to irrelevancy, or merely explained away. [26] Each item of experience “shall have the character of a particular instance of a general scheme” (1978: 3).
