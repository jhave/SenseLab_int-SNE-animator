However, by drawing on Alfred North Whitehead’s notion of “importance” from Modes of Thought, I expose the biocentric limitation inherent in the importance life acquires for bioarchitecture, and how this contributes to what he calls the “bifurcation of nature” into “primary” and “secondary” qualities. Following Whitehead’s proposal to overcome the bifurcation by constructing a system of general notions as “lures for feeling” the world differently, I ultimately extract a radically ecological, instead of biological, importance for the life of new bioarchitectural media.
