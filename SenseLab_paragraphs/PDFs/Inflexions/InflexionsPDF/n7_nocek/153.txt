[36] Whitehead writes that, “[e]xplanation by ‘tradition’ is merely another phraseology for explanation by ‘effcient cause.’ We require explanation by ‘fnal cause.’ Thus a single occasion is alive when the subjective aim which determines its process of concrescence has introduced a novelty of defniteness not to be found in the inherited data of its primary phase” (1978: 104). See Steven Shaviro’s excellent discussion of Whitehead’s use of effcient and fnal causality in his Without Criteria: Kant, Whitehead, Deleuze, and Aesthetics (2009: 86-89).
