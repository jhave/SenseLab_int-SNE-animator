The biological world of morphology, metabolism, coherence, evolution, and so on, were thought of as useful metaphors for the built environment. Architectural forms became analogically biological. Thus ftness, Steadman goes on to say, becomes a highly effective metaphor for characterizing how certain styles— the modernist style, for example— endure over time, or evolve to meet (cultural and historical) selection pressures. The issue is not whether the modernist structure, as a built entity with its materials and its geometries, achieves evolutionary stability or mutates in concert with the material and energetic exchanges it shares with its environment; but rather, at stake is whether the (abstract) form continues to guide the organization of materials, or evolves, creating new material organizations.
