Leaving aside, for the moment, the ethico-political stakes of applying the abstraction hierarchy to biological systems, the seeming benefts of this biotechnology are overwhelming. For example, one of Benjaminâ€™s architectural students, who, with no previous knowledge of synthetic biology, proposed the redesign of yeast and microalgae by using synthetic biology so that these cells were able to convert sugar and sunlight into fuel, but by generating 80% less carbon than is typical. He was able to reimagine the fuel cycle with vast implications at multiple scales, including architectural. [16]
