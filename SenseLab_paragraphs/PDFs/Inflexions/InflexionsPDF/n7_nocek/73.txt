decidedly  not  alive.  But  this  logic,  I  would  suggest,  reinforces  a  tyranny  at another level: the constant conjunction of life and biology. While their research acknowledges that protocells explore processes “associated with life,” life itself is nevertheless a state, and it is one that their protocells do not fully achieve — they are “semi-living,” at best. [21] In this regard, protocell architecture promotes, in spite of itself, the same biocentric conception of life that synthetic-life architecture advocates. In setting itself against biology, protocell architecture reinforces the stronghold of biology over life.
