[37] In Roberto Esposito’s, Bios: Biopolitics and Philosophy, he argues that in order to reverse the thanatopolitical declensions of biopolitics throughout the twentieth century (that saw its most intense articulation in Nazism) there can be no form of life that does not express life (Esposito 2008: 194); there can be no normative criteria for exclusion. There are many problems with this suggestion, one of which is that Esposito uses Gilles Deleuze’s concept of “a life” from his last essay, “Immanence: A Life,” without adequately distinguishing between “life” and the “living.” What Esposito misses, then, is that a life is radically indifferent to individual lives (it is the immanence of immanence, according to Deleuze), and cannot be used in the service of lefting lives. But as such, a life is indifferent to any absolute distinction between organic and inorganic, and so on this basis, a life is immanent to all orders – organic and inorganic. Thus, the biological order reintroduces  another  criteria  of  exclusion.  I  would  argue  that  this  is  deeply similar to Whitehead’s thesis that life is a “bid for freedom” from “tradition,”
