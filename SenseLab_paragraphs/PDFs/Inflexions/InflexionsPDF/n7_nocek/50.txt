If computationally driven design is capable of digitally simulating the biological world, it has so far been incapable of successfully incorporating material and construction logics into its design programs. CAD-CAM technologies are still driven by a top-down logic: the actual performance and behavior of materials is more of an afterthought than a co-driver in the design process. Matter, for all intents and purposes, is still inert and only given form by “immaterial code.” [11] If bioarchitecture wishes to be more than a species of computer science, then a more dynamic and robust relation between computation and materialization processes is required (cf. 2008a: 56).
