Simply stated, this consensus among speculative scientists of life is a damaging blow to the synthetic-life architecture described above. It’s important to note, however, that there are a host of architects and scientists using “living technologies” (Bedau et al. 2010) who are decidedly less concerned with biological-life synthesis, and far more interested in designing new potentials for living systems. The question of course is whether these technological mediations truly offer a non-biocentric conception of life for architecture.
