Whitehead’s concept of life offers us a non-bifurcating way to characterize biological systems: they are no longer defned by a difference that makes all the difference. While the biological sciences have tended to privilege biological systems because their “defning characteristic” is “life,” Whitehead challenges us to regard life, not as defning characteristic, or a tradition, but precisely as the interstice that lurks within tradition. With this transformation, biological systems may possess incredible degrees of flexibility and inventiveness (when compared to non-organic systems, for example), but they are not of a different nature or kind form other ordered systems; their defning characteristic is not life.
