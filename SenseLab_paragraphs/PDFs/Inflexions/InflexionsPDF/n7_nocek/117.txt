[5] It is important to note that despite Frazer ’s indebtedness to Richard Dawkins, who pioneered the “selfsh gene theory”—a gene-centered view of evolution— he is deeply committed to recent trends in evolutionary and developmental biology—e.g., Autopoiesis, Developmental Systems Theory, Evo Devo— that challenge the gene-centric view. In contrast to Dawkins, the gene is seen as only one among many factors that contribute to development and inheritance. Tim Jachna characterizes Frazer ’s understanding of the gene in the postscript to An Evolutionary Architecture as follows: “the notion of an ideal gene is useless. The merits of genetic information are revealed only in the process of their immersion in the context through the interface of the organism. Their meaning is purely relational”   (1995:   115).
