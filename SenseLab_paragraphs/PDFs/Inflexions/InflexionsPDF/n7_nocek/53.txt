Hensel  argues  that  recent  developments  in  biotechnology,  and  especially synthetic biology, provide the means for the material transformation in bioarchitecture. Synthetic biology is itself a highly amorphous feld that is hard to pin down. Broadly, it has been associated with the application of engineering design principles to living systems (cf. Carlson 2010: 83-86) according to three different, and not unrelated, models of design, each of which is associated with a scientifc spokesperson: device-based standardized construction (“BioBricks”): Drew Endy; problem-focused re-engineering of microbes: Jay Keasling; and whole-genome engineering (the synthesis of an entire genome): J. Craig Venter. [15] A number of architects and designers are now actively using “bioparts” as
