“Tradition” is the name Whitehead gives to the inheritance of a common form in a nexus of occasions. It is the insistence of “effcient causality” in an occasion’s concrescence. But within any social order, there is no one occasion that does not take a unique stand on its relation to the rest of the universe. Each occasion experiences a privacy that is unable to be shared by any other occasion, which is why Whitehead argues that all occasions are “essentially bipolar, physical and mental, and the physical inheritance is essentially accompanied by a conceptual reaction partly conformed to it, and partly introductory of a relevant novel contrast…” (1978: 108). Social order emerges from a shared relation among its members, but this is indissociable from the novelty immanent to the inheritance of a common form. Disorder is not opposed to order, then, it is in its interior, “lurking” within in it. Life is the name Whitehead gives to this disorder, so that “life lurks in the interstices of each living cell, and in the interstices of the brain” (105-6). [35] If life is “a bid for freedom,” it is a freedom from tradition, from effcient causality, and is the insistence of fnal causality (104). [36]
