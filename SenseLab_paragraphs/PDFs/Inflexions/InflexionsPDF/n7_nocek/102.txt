The point of this excursion into Whitehead is not to generate a new concept of life itself that could see life in the materials of the built environment; Whitehead does not offer us such a concept. Life is an abstraction from experience, not a representation of it, whose aim is to transform our habits of thought. Recall that the “aim of philosophy is sheer disclosure” (1938: 49), and it is the disclosure, and not the concepts themselves, that “always will have the last word” (2011: 17). Concepts are necessary for the transformation, they are what generate it, but it is the transformation that is most important. To propose that life lurks in the interstices of each order is pragmatic: can it generate different habits of thought?
