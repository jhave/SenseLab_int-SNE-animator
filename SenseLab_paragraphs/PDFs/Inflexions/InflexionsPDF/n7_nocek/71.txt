And yet there is no doubt in the minds of these researchers that these molecular globules are not living. Hanczyc et al. (2007) and Ikegami and Hanczyc (2009) affrm  that their protocells possess some, but certainly not all of the properties of life. In this regard, their research modifes much of the extant protocell research (Rasmussen et al. 2009), since it advocates that protocells do not have to be alive to exist; they exist as the “frst cell,” an achievement on the way to synthesizing life (Ikegami and Hanczyc 2009). Similarly, Armstrong notes that, “protocells are the transition stage towards the creation of fully artifcial cells…” (2011: 18). In fact, Armstrong and Spiller are insistent that they are not building synthetic-life architecture: “Protocells do not operate within the realms of biological processes that are associated with living systems…” (21). Their technology is based on a chemistry and physics that opposes the tyranny of the DNA molecule. At times, they even speak with understandable disdain about the dogma of the natural world, and propose what they call the unnatural evolution of protocells.
