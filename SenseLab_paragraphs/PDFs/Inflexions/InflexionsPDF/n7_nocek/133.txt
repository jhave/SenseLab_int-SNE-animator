[18] In her monograph, Surplus Life: Biotechnology and Capital in the Neoliberal Era , Melinda Cooper makes the case that the destandardization of life is inseparable from neoliberal investment in biological futures of flexibility and regeneration. She shows how the birth of genetic engineering, as a practice, is inseparable from the Regan administration’s need  for a  political  tool  to  denounce  the environmental regulations of the Carter-era. She suggests that Regan created the economic conditions for recombinant DNA technology (rDNA) to flourish— through a series of reforms that made investment in biotech easier— as a basis for denouncing the Carter-era rhetoric of post-Fordist, economic and environmental “crisis.” If life could be “destandardized,” then there would be a foundation for the neo-conservative rhetoric whereby the biosphere was far from depleted, as was previously thought from industrialism, but could be turned into a new opportunity for investment – a post-industrial economy of flexibility, a bioeconomy (Cooper 2008: 25-29).
