According to Whitehead, in order to remedy the modern “fallacy” of thought that produces the bifurcation of experience, an ultimate, generic principle is required; this is not in order to delimit the absolute limits of thought, but it is in order to constrain thought productively so that it may construct only according to what is exemplifed by all experiences; without this obligation, philosophy once again “indulges in brilliant feats of explaining away.” For Whitehead, “creativity is the universal of universals characterizing ultimate matter of fact,” and is what explains the transition between the “many” and the “one”; “it is the ultimate principle by which the many, which are the universe disjunctively, become the one actual occasion, which is the universe conjunctively” (1978: 21). With the constraint of creativity, one of the oldest dualisms in Western thought – the “many” and the “one”— is overcome: every one, even the most repetitious one, is the coming together of the disjunctive many into a novel one, so that the many are then increased by one. “Creativity, many, one,” these are the notions that “complete the Category of the Ultimate” in Whitehead’s thought; all “more special  categories”  in  his  general  scheme  presuppose  the  Category  of  the Ultimate (21).
