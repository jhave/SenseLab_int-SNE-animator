[28] This is the great relevance of Whitehead’s work on the speculative proposition. In contrast to his early work with Bertrand Russell in the Principia Mathematica (1910, 1912, 1913), by the time of Process and Reality Whitehead suggests that a proposition is neither true nor false, but is more importantly, a “lure for feeling,” a way the world could be felt. The truth of a proposition is an additional  qualifcation   that  depends  on  whether  the  predicate  is  actually realized in the nexus physically felt (Whitehead 1978: 187-188).
