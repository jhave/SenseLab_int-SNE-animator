It is for the purposes of charting the importance of living processes for bioarchitecture that I turn to John Frazer ’s now seminal work, An Evolutionary Architecture (1995). In this work, he boldly claims that, “architecture is considered a form of artifcial life, subject, like the natural world, to principles of morphogenesis, genetic coding, replication and selection. The aim of an evolutionary architecture is to achieve in the built environment the symbiotic behaviour and metabolic balance that are characteristic of the natural environment” (1995: 9). But as Frazer attests, it was only with advances outside of architecture (and even biology), in computer science, mathematics, and evolutionary computation that evolutionary architecture could develop into a mature feld of speculative research. John Holland’s research and development of the  genetic  algorithm  in  his  1975  work,  Adaptation  in  Natural  and  Artifcial Systems, and its later application by Richard Dawkins in the Blind Watchmaker (1986) (“biomorphs”), were two such advancements.
