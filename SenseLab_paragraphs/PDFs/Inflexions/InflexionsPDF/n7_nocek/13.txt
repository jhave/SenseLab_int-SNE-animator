the design of form is most often conceived of as a top-down process in which material realization is a product of a logic or set of criteria (in the mind of the architect) other than the actual material conditions within which it fnds itself embedded. A structure’s relationship to the micro-activities of its environment— wind speed, temperature gradients, landscape, etc.— are accommodated by technologies (environmentally sensitive surfaces—heat generation and transportation systems) only after the generation of form. For Weinstock, this top-down method, exemplifed by the modernist discourse on universal space, [1] neglects the range of material and energetic relations a structure can share within its environment, which all must be included in the generation of form when the goal is “performance-oriented design” in a dynamic environment.
