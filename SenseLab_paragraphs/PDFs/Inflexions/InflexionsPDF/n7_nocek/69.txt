There are a number of different species of protocells in existence now, and it is even possible to chemically “program” them to perform different tasks. [19] In this regard, they have even been thought of as “material computers” capable of rebuilding their environment (Armstrong 2011). It is no surprise that protocells have become an important new media of speculative design; they are a form of low-cost biotechnology, according to Spiller and Armstrong, that function as environmentally  sensitive  computing  units  capable  of  building  their environment from the bottom-up. Armstrong, for her part, has been actively involved in promoting protocell technology as a way of generating an artifcial reef to stop the sinking of Venice, Italy. [20]
