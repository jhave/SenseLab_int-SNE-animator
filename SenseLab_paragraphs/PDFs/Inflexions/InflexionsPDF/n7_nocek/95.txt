According to Whitehead, the actual entity decides on how it will integrate, or “prehend,” each perspective into the constitution of itself becoming a subject as a determinate “concrescence” of these perspectives. However, this concrescence is neither a fusing nor aggregation, but a patterning, such that each perspective in the manifold is woven into the oneness of a concrescing subject becoming itself without losing its unique character. For Whitehead, all entities become what they are through their prehensions of other entities.  Prehension itself has a complex structure, consisting of three aspects: “(a) the subject which is prehending ... (b) the datum which is prehended [and] (c) the subjective form which is how subject prehends the datum” (1978: 23). The subject feels the datum in a particular way. The many data then grow together into a realized “perspectival harmonization.” This unity is privately felt as a “satisfaction” that withdraws from all future relation, as it perishes instantly, becoming objective datum — a “superject” — for future occasions to incorporate into their own becoming— “the many become one, and are increased by one.” [30]
