In  the  short  animated  flm,  The  Cathedral  (Katedra)  (2002),  Polish  animator Tomasz Baginski presents a vision of cosmic horror in which a man approaches what looks like a medieval cathedral on an unknown, post-apocalyptic planet. As the man explores the inside of the structure, the light of his torch reveals to the viewer that the pillars of the cathedral are living faces. By the end of the flm, the sun  animates  the  cathedral,  which  then  consumes  the  man  in  its  organic
outgrowths, turning him into another face in one of its many pillars.
