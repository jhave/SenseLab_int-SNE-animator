[24] There is an important overlap between Whitehead’s problem-based constructivism and the constructivism of Deleuze and Deleuze and Guattari. In What is Philosophy? (1994) Deleuze and Guattari write that, “a concept lacks meaning to the extent that it is not connected to other concepts and is not linked to a problem that it resolves or helps to resolve” (79). Also see Isabelle Stengers marvelous discussion of the relation between Whitehead and Deleuze-Guattari on the construction of an “image of thought” in her Thinking with Whitehead. She writes that, “[s]peculative propositions [Whitehead’s] do not designate a world that exists prior to them, but, quite the contrary, they bring into existence what Deleuze and Guattari call an ‘image of thought,’ in the sense that such an image coincides with a ‘thought without images,’ that is, without a stopping point that makes words and things coincide in a satisfactory way” (2011: 267).
