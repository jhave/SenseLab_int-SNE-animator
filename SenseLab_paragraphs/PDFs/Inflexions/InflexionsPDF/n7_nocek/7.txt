This may seem like a strange place to begin an article on architecture. And yet my frst introduction to this animation was in an article, “The Cathedral Is Alive: Animating Biomimetic Architecture,” by Dennis Dollens that appeared in the journal, Animation: An Interdisciplinary Journal (2006). My enthusiasm for using animation as a model for “living architecture” was eventually dashed upon realizing that Baginski’s piece was used as a way to think about the potentials of biomimetic architecture: the outgrowth of the cathedral is thematically read as a model for biomimetic design, and animation is the appropriate medium for such research. My own disappointment with his reading of the piece has neither to do with Dollens’ explicitly architectural interpretation – he notes that the flm is only
