The development of the GA by Holland and Dawkins proved extremely useful for evolutionary design. Instead of architects being the agents of design, algorithms that enact the process of natural selection, became the new designers of form. [4] Frazer explains that, “[t]he evolutionary model requires that an architectural  concept  be  described  in  a  form  of  ‘genetic  code.’  This  code  is mutated and developed by computer program into a series of models in response to  a  simulated  environment”  (1995:  65).  Frazer  also  makes  important modifcations  to  the  original  model  of  “optimization,”  however.  Instead  of fnding the best solution to a problem known in advance, following recent work in evolutionary and developmental biology, [5] Frazer argues that environmental
