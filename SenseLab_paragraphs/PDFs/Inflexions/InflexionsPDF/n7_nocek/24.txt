Steadman’s narrative is compelling for a number of reasons, not least of which is the contrast he allows us to draw between the metaphorical use of biology by architects and the more recent bioscientifc methods of research employed by designers—the so-called “biological paradigm.” Architectural form is no longer pre-given (in the mind of an architect, for instance) but is itself a product of morphogenesis, thus “paralleling a wider scientifc search for a theory of morphogenesis in the natural word” (Frazer 1995: 9).
