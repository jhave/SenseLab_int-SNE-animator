In the special issue of Architectural Design, Techniques and Technologies in Morphogenetic Design, Michael Hensel describes this trend of turning to notions of morphology   and   metabolism   in   design   as   exemplary   of   the   “biological paradigm” in architecture. This paradigm, thought to describe an amorphous feld whose experiments range from computational architectures (e.g., the use of genetic, evolutionary, and parallel algorithms) to biochemical engineering (e.g., creating artifcial photosynthesis), is arguably unifed  by its concern for using the dynamism of the natural world, however that be conceived (neo-Darwinian, symbiotic, etc.), [3] as a model for an architecture capable of a dynamic relationship with its environment.
