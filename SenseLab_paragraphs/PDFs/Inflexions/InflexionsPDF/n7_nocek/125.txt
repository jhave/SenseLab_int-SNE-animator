[11] Frazer confrms Hensel and Menges’ thesis, namely, that matter is only an afterthought, a passive receptacle for form: “[e]ventually it is our intention that the form-making process will be part of the system, but for the moment our model works by describing the process of processing and assembling the materials. The actual processing and assembly is external to the model” (1995:
99).
