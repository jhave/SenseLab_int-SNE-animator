[25] In this regard, despite the sympathies Whitehead has for Henri Bergson, noting  that,  “[o]ne  of  my  great  preoccupations  has  been  to  rescue  their [Bergson’s, James’, and Dewey’s] type of thought from the charge of anti- intellectualism…” (1978: xii), Bergson’s method of intuition seeks to be “transported into the interior of an object in order to coincide with what there is unique and consequently inexpressible in it” (Bergson 1968: 190). For Whitehead, by contrast, philosophic concepts are speculative abstractions that leap into the “thin air of Imaginative generalization” (1978: 5). For a careful discussion of Bergson’s intuition and Whitehead’s abstraction see Didier Debaise’s “The Emergence of Speculative Empiricism: Whitehead Reading Bergson” (2009).
