connection to the work or subordination of another. (...)  Primary research for the map came from  years  of  cultural  and political  work  within activist  and reform movements against the United States’ prison system, and emerged from a perceived   need  to expand   the  analytical   basis   for   that work   beyond the limitations  of  nationally  framed  legal,  institutional  and civil  discourse. Especially after September 11,  2001, a condition  of  statelessness appeared to increasingly define the nature  of  imprisonment  and mass  prison  expansion  (which is now a global, albeit  US driven  phenomena), making  the figure  of the prisoner less  and less   discernable  from  displaced figures  the world  over  whose  resources  and power are progressively seized and expropriated.” (Hunt, 2008:  145-146)11
