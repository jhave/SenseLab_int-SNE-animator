“Has the ideology of  our  time  not become an erratic, wavering pattern of crisscrossing footsteps, traced in secure metric points on an abstract field? The aesthetic form of the dérive   is   everywhere.  But   so   is   the hyper-rationalist   grid   of   Imperial   infrastructure.” (Holmes, 2003b)
