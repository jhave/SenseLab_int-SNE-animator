The iSee project lays emphasis on a dynamic cartography in which localization and route are combined into  subversive maps that highlight the creation of experimental, communal and creative strategies for appropriation and transformation of both media and new technologies—namely those that are central to the current “surveillance society”—as  a means to enhance the sharing,  creation and free flux  of signals, things, people, actions, and affections. In an interview with  Erich W. Schienke, published in 2002  by the Surveillance & Society15  magazine, the IAA called  attention  to the potential  of  the iSee application  when combined with locative media (on  which they were already working), as the intersection between the two would eventually transform the application  into  a general  purpose  mapping  instrument,  open to the creative intervention of its users, specifically through GPS-enabled PDAs, who would  thus  be able to insert  multiple data and narratives  onto the maps.
