“In  order  to  work, surveillance  systems  depend  on their  subjects  (indeed,  as Foucault observed  a long time ago, subjects become ‘the bearers of their own surveillance’   1979).   Although   there   is   a  sense   in   which   the  subjects    of surveillance  become ‘objectified'  as  their  data doubles  become more  real  to the surveillance  system  than the bodies  and daily  lives  from  which  the data have been drawn,  their  involvement  with  surveillance  systems  often  remains active, conscious and intentional.  People comply  (but not as dupes), negotiate and at times  resist  the surveillance  systems in  which their  lives  are  enmeshed.” (Lyon, 2007:  55)
