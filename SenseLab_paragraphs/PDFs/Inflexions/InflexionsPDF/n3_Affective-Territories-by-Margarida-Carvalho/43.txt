17   Quoting  Sadie  Plant:  “One of  psychogeography’s  principle  means  was  the dérive. Long a favorite  practice  of  the Dadaists,  who organized  a variety  of  expeditions,  and the surrealists,  for   whom the  geographical   form   of   automatism   was   an instructive pleasure, the dérive, the drift, was defined by the situationists as the ‘technique of locomotion without a goal’, in which ‘one or more persons during a certain period drop their  usual  motives  for  movement and action,  their  relations,  their  work   and leisure activities,   and let   themselves   be  drawn by the  attractions   of   the terrain   and  the encounters  they find there’.  The  dérive  acted as something of a model for the ‘playful creation’ of all human relationships.” (Plant, 1992:  58-59).
18  We  are  referring  here  to the notion of  allegory  in  the sense meant by Craig  Owens and derived from Walter Benjamin’s Ursprung des deutschen trauerspiels (1928). Specifically: “Allegorical imagery is appropriated imagery: the allegorist does not invent images  but confiscates  them.   He  lays  claim  to the culturally  significant,  poses  as its interpreter.  And in  his  hands  the image  becomes  something  other  (allos  =  other  + agoreuei = to speak). He  does not restore an original meaning that may have been lost or  obscured;  allegory  is not hermeneutics.  Rather,  he adds another  meaning to the image. If  he adds, however,  he does  so  only  to  replace:  the allegorical  meaning supplants an antecedent one; it is a supplement. This is why allegory is condemned, but it is also the source of its theoretical significance.” (Owens, 1984:  205)
