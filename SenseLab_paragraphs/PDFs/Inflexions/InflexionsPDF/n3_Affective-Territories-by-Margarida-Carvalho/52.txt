Just  as  in  the project  Video  Sniffin’,  developed by  the collective MediaShed27,  which  includes  the videos  The  Commercial  (2006),   Minä Olen (2006),  The  Duellist  (2007),  and Spy  Kitting  (2006-2007), in  Faceless the city is transformed into a permanent film set and the act of creation becomes  a gesture  of  appropriation  and transformation  of  the omnipresent gaze of the surveillance cameras. In this context to create is to affectively  populate a territory,  to rescue  it from  the barrenness  and lethargy in which the non-reciprocated gaze of the surveillance cameras had plunged it.
Faceless is the result  of not only a brilliant  conceptual intuition but also of a subtle artistic work, manifest on the visual and the narrative ways in which Manu Luksch appropriates the circles superimposed on the faces of  the recorded  individuals,  except for the  artist  herself,  the only  visible face  (an artifice legally  imposed  to owners of  surveillance cameras,  for the screening  of  CCTV  captured  images,  with  the intent  of  protecting
the citizens’ privacy).
