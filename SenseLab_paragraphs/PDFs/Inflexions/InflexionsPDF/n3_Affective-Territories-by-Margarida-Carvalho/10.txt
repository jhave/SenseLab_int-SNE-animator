anthropological,  to the point where  an ethnographic  mapping  of  an institution or  a community is a primary form of site-specific art today.” (Foster, 1996:  184-185)

conviction   is  that we need  radically  inventive   maps   exactly  like   we need  radical political  movements:  to go beyond received  ideas  and orders,  in  fact,  to go beyond representation,   to  rediscover   and  share   the  space   –   creating   potentials   of    a revolutionary imagination.” (Holmes, 2003a)
