“Faceless  treats  the CCTV  image  as an example  of  a legal readymade  (objet trouvé).  The  medium,  in  the sense of  ‘raw  materials  that are  transformed  into artwork’,  is  not adequately  described  as simply  video  or  even captured  light. More   accurately,   the  medium   comprises   images   that  exist   contingent   on particular   social   and legal   circumstances  –  essentially,   images   with a  legal superstructure. Faceless interrogates the laws that govern the video surveillance of society and the codes of  communication that articulate their operation, and in both its mode of coming into being and its plot, develops a specific critique.” (Luksch & Patel, 2007:  74)
