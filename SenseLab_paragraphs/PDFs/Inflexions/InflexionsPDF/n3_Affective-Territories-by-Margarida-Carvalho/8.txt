“Such reflexivity is essential, for, as Bordieu warned, ethnographic mapping is predisposed  to a Cartesian  opposition  that leads  the observer  to abstract  the culture   of   study.  Such   mapping  may  thus confirm   rather   than contest the authority  of  mapper  over  site  in  a way  that reduces  the desired  exchange  of dialogical fieldwork.” (Foster, 1996:  190)
