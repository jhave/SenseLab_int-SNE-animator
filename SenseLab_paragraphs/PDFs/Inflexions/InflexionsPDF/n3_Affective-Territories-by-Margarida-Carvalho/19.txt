The  collective  volume An  Atlas   of Radical  Cartography reaches into this “affectivism”,  as Brian  Holmes calls it, creating  new territories of possibilities by  casting  different  looks into existing  territories, illuminating areas  of  darkness,  indetermination  and  marginalization, but  also analytically  scrutinizing  the complex  networks  that support  the geographies  of  contemporary  capitalism.  The  theme of  Atlas   is introduced immediately  on the cover,  which  shows an inverted map of the world; subtly, ironically, it’s right at the surface that we plunge into an “upside down” world in which an extraordinary complexity entails a growing  opacity   in   obvious  contradiction  with   the  proliferation   of discourses on transparency and the immediacy of the society of information  (in  fact,  the current  worldwide  financial  crisis  is  an unmistakable proof of this opacity).
Reminiscent of the urgent need for an “aesthetics of cognitive mapping”  capable  of  challenging  the perplexity  and incomprehension of  the postmodern individual  in face of  the complex  (multinational  and communicational)  networks  that  traverse  his/hers  experience— suggested  by Frederic  Jameson, in  1984,   on his  famous  article,  later turned into a book, Postmodernism or,  The Cultural Logic of  Late Capitalism—, the  Ashley   Hunt   map, titled  A  World   Map: in  which  we see...  (2005),  is  perhaps,  of  all  the maps  in  this  Atlas, the one that most openly takes on an analytic and didactic approach.
