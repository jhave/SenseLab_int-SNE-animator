imposed that particular type of privacy or privation. When a territory of possibility emerges  it changes the social  map, like a landslide, a flood  or  a volcano do in nature.   The   easiest   way   for  society   to  protect   its   existing   form   is   denial, pretending   the  change  never   happened:   and  that  actually   works   in   the landscape  of  mentalities. An  affective  territory  disappears  if it isn’t elaborated, constructed, modulated, differentiated,  prolonged  by new breakthroughs  and conjunctions. There  is no use  defending  such  territories  and even believing  in them is only the barest beginning. What they urgently need is to be developed, with   forms,  rhythms,  inventions,  discourses,  practices,  styles,  technologies  –  in short, with cultural codes. ” (Holmes, 2008b)
