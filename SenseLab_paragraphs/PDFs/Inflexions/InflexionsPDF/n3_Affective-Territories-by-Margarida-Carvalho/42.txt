“What we are  witnessing  today, however,  is not a one-way delocalization  or deterritorialization,  but rather  a volatile  combination  of  the  diffused and the positioned,  or  the placeless  and the place-coded.  Perhaps  nowhere has  this been more  apparent  than with  mobile  GIS and location-aware  technologies. (…)  Tracking  has  played  a primary  role in  this shift. Its landscapes  of  inclination- position fuel  the geospatial interfaces -- such as evidenced in Google Maps and the C5 GPS  media player -- which are becoming important  modes of access to any phenomenon.” (Crandall, 2006)19
