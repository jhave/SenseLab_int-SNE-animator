“Ausreisezentren,  or,  ‘departure  centers’,  are  camps  for  refugees  and migrants that, due to missing  papers,  cannot be deported.  Asylum seekers held in  these camps are accused by authorities of concealing their land of origin and resisting obtaining  passports.  So  far  there  are seven departure  centers  in  Germany.  (...) Collectively,  we have experimented  with  cartographic  representation  in  order to pose  these  questions: What kind  of  spaces  does  the German  system of  the administration  of  migrants  produce? How  do political and social circumstances appear geo-graphically? Which potential for analysis or evaluation is offered by a spatial representation?  How   can a critique  of   exclusion  be  formulated by means  of   mapping?   How   can  the varying   levels   of   state and  institutional structure  be brought  into  relation  with  those of  individual  experience?  How is subjective knowledge transmitted by this?” (An Architektur with a42.org, 2008)
