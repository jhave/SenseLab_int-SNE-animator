“At root,  tactical  media  is  an interventionist  practice  that creates  disruption within   existing   systems  of   power  and control.  Less   a methodology   than an orientation, it is fundamentally pragmatic, utilizing any and all available technologies,  aesthetics   and methods  as dictated  by the  goals of   a given action.  Tactical  media  are  often ephemeral  and event-driven,  existing  only  as long as they continue to be effective.  They  vanish  into thin air  once their  utility has   been   exhausted,    leaving    only    traces    in    the   form    of    memories, documentation and journalistic accounts. (…) Extending these notions to spatial representation,  ‘tactical  cartography’  refers  to the creation,  distribution,  and use  of  spatial  data to intervene in systems  of  control  affecting  spatial  meaning and practice. “(Institute for Applied Autonomy, 2008:  29-30)
