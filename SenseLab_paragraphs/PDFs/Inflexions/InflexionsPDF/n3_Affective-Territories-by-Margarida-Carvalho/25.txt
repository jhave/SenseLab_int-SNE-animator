The figure of the placeless, namely the clandestine immigrant and the refugee,  is  mapped  by the collective  An  Architektur12   through a detailed  cartography of  the Departure  Center at FÃ¼rth  (a center for illegal  immigrants  with   no passports  or  similar  documentation) in  the German Bavaria, as well as by visualizations of the center-mediated relationships between the asylum seekers and the several institutions involved (medical, juridical, law enforcement, among others), as well as the procedures for seeking asylum in Germany.
