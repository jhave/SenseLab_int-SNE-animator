In effect,  if the aesthetical  form  of  the dérive  has  made a strong come back in our contemporary experience, be it under the guise of the individual in transit, freed from geographical constrains and  available for new encounters  through  the always-on  digital  technologies,  or  through the nomadic navigation  on the World   Wide Web, never  before  have wanderings, routes and behaviors been this registered, stored and controlled20, true  to the deleuzian  concept of  “dividual”21  – the current condition of the individual when reduced to a “data subject” (the result of an endless split between an individual’s physical self and his/hers data representation)  22.
