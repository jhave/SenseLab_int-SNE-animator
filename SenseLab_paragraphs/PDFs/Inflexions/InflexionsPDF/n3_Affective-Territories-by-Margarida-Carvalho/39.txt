“While explicitly framed as speculative, exploratory and anarchic, the close  link established  between a kind  of  materialist  ontology and political  emancipation has  become a recurring  trope  in  the commentaries  on locative  media.  To  a certain  extent,  the trend  corresponds  with a desire  to transcend  the limits  of postmodern   theorization   and  the apparent   “elitism”   of   net.art,   however,   a range  of  competing  motivations  and influences  have emerged  in  the diverse fields   that  have  converged   around   the  topic  of   augmented  reality.   For researchers Anne Galloway and Matt Ward, new archaeological techniques developed  in  conjunction  with photography,  GPS  and cartographic  mapping coincide through locative  media as social platforms. This correlation is identified with the activation  of  static architectures  in  order  to restore  ‘hope’ through  the transformation of urban landscapes.” (Dieter, 2007:  198)
The  activation  and “rewriting”  of  the urban landscape  brought about by  the artistic practices  associated  with locative media  must be considered in conjunction with a tendency to develop a cinematic and interactive architecture capable of creating a total immersion effect on the digital  set16.  This urban  allegorization is translated  into street  culture and intervention,  as  is  the case with  the laser  graffiti  proposed  by the Graffiti    Research    Lab,   L.A.S.E.R   Tag    (2007);    narrative   and  playful networked  city  in  which  space is  mapped with  messages  recorded  by cyclists  who, alone,  explore  the city   streets  in  search  of     “hideaway places” where to leave their  stories and listen to those of others, in Rider
