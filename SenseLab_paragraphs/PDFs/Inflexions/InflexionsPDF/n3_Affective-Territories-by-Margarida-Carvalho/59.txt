Monitored, assessed,  controlled, divided  and owned: such is  the complex condition of contemporary space which may nevertheless become our  territory  if traversed  by  affects,  bodies  and gestures  that inhabit it and make it communal. It is this possibility that, in different ways, movies  like  Faceless,  the  photographs  and  cartographies  of Baumgarten, and the maps of An  Atlas  of  Radical Cartography address. In their  singularity and difference, these works of art offer evidence that the creation of this emerging territory, this labor of geopoetics, canâ€™t relinquish a relationship with technology and the media. On  the contrary: this is a political relationship and therefore an imperative one.
