Thus, as  David  Lyon  notes  on «The  End  of  Privacy»  (Lyon,  2007), the 	contemporary	“surveillance	society”23—where	location-aware corporations  such  as Digital  Angel  and  VeriChip24 arise,  along  with  the omnipresence of closed-circuit TV networks (CCTV) in urban spaces and the development of a new penology based on the prediction of risk and on  the  identification   and  management of   the  categorized   groups according  to different  degrees  of  danger (Ericson,  R. &  Haggerty,  K.,
1997)—has  been progressively  replacing  the criteria  of  public  benefit with  that of  risk  minimization  in  what concerns  the assessment  of  public policies, a tendency which only gained strength since the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on September 11th  2001.  To question this new condition,  to confront  the technical  apparatus,  to subvert and experiment, to rise above its time, this is what we can and should expect from contemporary art.
