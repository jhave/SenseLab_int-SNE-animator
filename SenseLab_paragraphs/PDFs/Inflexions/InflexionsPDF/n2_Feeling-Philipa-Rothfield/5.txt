The thing  about  dancing is that all there is is the dancing. There are myriad terms which  circle the activity,  ways in, through language, that aim to capture what happens. But the capturing itself has its own style, its own technologies of thought, its own manner of moving, along with  the dance.  So each duet  between philosophy and dance  differs. And while each duet  is a field of enabling
moments — possible ways  of engaging dance —these engagements between philosophy and dance  are also staged. In the enterprise of language, we are shaped by the particular conceptual field. Dance appears through these concepts. The concepts dance  the dance,  animating it conceptually. That animation may seem to ‘fit the facts’ but it is also generative.
