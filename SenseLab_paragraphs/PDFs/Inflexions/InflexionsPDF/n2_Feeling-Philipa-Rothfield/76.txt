[3] “In the phraseology of mathematical physics a feeling has a vector  character” (Whitehead, 1960: 353-354).  “…remember that in physics ‘vector’ means definite transmission from elsewhere” (177). In physics, vectors  allow quantity to be qualified through the notion of direction. For example, the motion of a car has a speed but it also travels in a direction. These combine to create velocity.
Velocity is represented in physics via vector  relations. Feelings are directional
towards the new as they come from the old: “The feelings  are inseparable from the end at which  they aim; and this end is the feeler.  The feelings  aim at the feeler, as their final cause”  (339).  “Feelings are ‘vectors’; for they feel what  is there and  transform it into what  is here” (133).
