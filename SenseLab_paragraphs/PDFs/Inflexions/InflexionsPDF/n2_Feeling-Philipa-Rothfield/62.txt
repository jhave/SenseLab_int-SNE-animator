If there is a kind  of two-fold order which  conditions that which  is relevant, then the job of the dancer is to work  backwards, to play with  those conditions as they become  effectively  relevant, to evoke conditions, then make decisions with respect to those conditions.  Dumas’  manner of teaching choreography illustrates the point.  Eschewing the notion of ‘a solution’, Dumas will, over time, explore  a range  of possible physical approaches towards a particular choreographic activity. These consist  of exclusive possibilities (alternatives). The challenge is to evoke these disjunctive-yet-relevant conditions as a field of potentiality in the midst of making physical decisions, that is, in the midst of dancing. The field of potentiality, its relevance, must  be associated with  the movement in the concrete instance (actual  occasion)  as a matter of felt (or feel-able) proximity, through what might  be called the trace. Sometimes we will break with  a particular line of working and insert  something else, a series of activities which  exemplifies a particular aspect  of the activity.  Then we go back to the original activity. Something of that physically, temporally proximate activity  ‘ghosts’ what follows. This is an example of a trace.  Traces need  not be temporally immediate.
It is possible, though not necessarily easy, to evoke the trace of former movement
decisions, in the process of actualization.
