Although subjectivity extends into the past via completion (and  superjectivity), there  is something incredibly dynamic about  the flowering that occurs in the growing complexity of concrescence. Whitehead’s analysis of process —its intricate constitution according to an indivisible temporality — somehow manages the instability of reality  in its process of becoming, alongside an empirical fealty to the stubborn historicity of fact. Subjectivity encapsulates the agency  of the process, its will to power, not forever,  but for a while.   Whitehead depicts God, both as keeper of the conceptual order and  as the conduit of relevance and proximity. It behoves the vicissitudes of the occasion  to concretize these matters in the realm  of sensation. We are returned to a Humean allegiance
