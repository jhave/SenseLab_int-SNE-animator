Dumas explicitly  rejects the notion of control  in his work,  preferring to speak  of the dancer’s management of instability. He intensifies that instability by keeping to a narrow base (legs under hip sockets)  rather than  the soldier’s wide  stance with  feet firmly planted on the ground. Allied to the elimination of muscular holding patterns and  the increase of felt sensation, this body is alive to the micro movements that emerge and  cluster  around a choreographic moment. The instability which  is intensified — both at the level of feeling and in the choreographic ‘tasks’ — calls for some management. The dancer’s virtuosity, in Dumas’ work,  consists  of the execution of movement, walking the path,  in such a way as to deal with an increased amplitude of movement possibilities inherent at each and  every moment, with  the sort of ease suggested by walking. A
movement well done  will be one whose  complex challenges will be met in such a
way that the observer feels the familiar timbre of those  sensory pleasures which attend a stroll in the park.  The point  of such ease is to make identification between dancer and observer possible through a common habitus of everyday movement. Virtuosity in this setting is the achievement of complexity in relation to a physical palette of easeful  movement. This notion of virtuosity is not aimed to inspire admiration from afar. It can be contrasted with  a relation of alienation, in which  the observer feels a movement is something they could  not do and consequently admires the difference. Huge  leg extensions, for example, or circus feats, provoke admiration from afar. They may inspire trepidation and
