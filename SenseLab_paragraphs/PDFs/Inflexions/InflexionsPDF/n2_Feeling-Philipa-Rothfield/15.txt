I like the way Whitehead’s account combines the old with  the new, through feeling. As I marveled this thick feeling-from-the-inside in my dancing, I also wondered how come.  How  come I can feel this now? What has happened to enable  this feeling which,  in a sense, feels like it was always around? This was
not a feeling I was ‘making’ happen.  Something was letting  it occur, something I
couldn’t quite  grasp but could  nevertheless feel. Feelings,  for Whitehead, effect a passage from something there to a kind  of here (Whithead, 1960: 133). The here- ness of feeling within an activity  such as dancing occurs in virtue of “the real internal constitution of its subject”  (1960: 133): “The term ‘subject’ has been retained because in this sense it is familiar in philosophy. But it is misleading” (Whitehead, 1960: 339).
