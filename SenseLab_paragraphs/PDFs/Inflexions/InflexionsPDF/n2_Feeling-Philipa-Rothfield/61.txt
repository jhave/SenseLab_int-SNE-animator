Whitehead writes  of effective relevance, as that which  can only belong  to actual occasions.  There seem to be two strands of the sort of relevance which  conditions potentiality. One derives from the God who conditions actuality through ordering eternal objects. This God transforms eternal objects from a disjunctive series of predicates (the universal set of all possible concepts) to a sphere of possibility which  is linked to the real world. Careful  not to preempt reality,  God nevertheless orders “the relevance of eternal objects to the process of creation” (Whitehead, 1960: 522). This is a sort of potential of potential. First order
potential comes from God, then a second order arises according to conceptual
ingression within the actual  occasion.  While both are real, the latter  has effective relevance.
