Dumas’ work  is predicated upon what  he would call ‘felt sensations’ in the body. Dumas appeals to the dancer’s lived engagement with  sensations in part  because his choreography, whilst  particular, does not, cannot,  necessitate one manner of execution.  Unlike the reification inherent in ballet’s fixed lexicon of movement, the (post)modern character of Dumas’  work  requires the choreographic formulation of movement material out of malleable vocabularies of movement. This is not improvisation as it is commonly understood but requires of the
dancer an in-the-moment series of improvisatory adjustments in the process  of
the material’s execution. Dumas’  often speaks of Roland Barthes’ account of a daily  walk through the park.  Though the path  stays the same, each day the walk differs. Taking into account the circularity of movement (that a 3-dimensional body  moves  through the path)  the very simplest dance  between the foot and  the floor can engage a myriad of vicissitudes. The difference from ballet lies in the fact that Dumas’  work  does not consist  of pre-given, recognizable movements. While the ballet dancer must  also dance  in the moment, she/he need  not identify a field of possibility in relation to the choreographic imperative. The ballet dancer’s task is repetition of the lexicon according to new choreographic assemblages and the vicissitudes of the moment. Dumas’  dancer must  learn  to repeat new movements via the assistance of feeling in the service  of repetition.
