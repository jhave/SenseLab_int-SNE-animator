muscularity is also felt. A muscular manner of moving has its own world of muscular feelings  but these latter feelings  mask the felt sensations that arise in relation to subtle  shifts in the body (a focused feeling of feeling). Ballet’s muscularity and Dumas’ felt sensation are inconsistent; ultimately, they cannot enjoy mutual sensitivity. Whitehead writes:  “what an actual  entity  has avoided as a datum for feeling may yet be an important part  of its equipment” (Whitehead, 1960: 346).
