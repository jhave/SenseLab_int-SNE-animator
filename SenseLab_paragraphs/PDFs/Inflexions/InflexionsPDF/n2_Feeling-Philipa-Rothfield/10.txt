Whitehead writes  of a swinging motion, whereby the emergence of newness moves  between two poles, which  I have dubbed the old and  the new, and repeats itself “to the crack of doom in the creative advance from creature to creature” (Whitehead, 1960: 347). It’s not that the new is all there is. The ‘creative  advance’ takes something of the old with it. There is a moment of repetition in which aspects of the old are taken  into the new. [2] The old sets up the conditions for
the emergence of the new. It flows into the new, enabling, facilitating the
generation of newness.
