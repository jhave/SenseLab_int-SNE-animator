The three  categoreal obligations account for the selection  process at work  in dancing: between the muscularity inherent in say classical ballet and the palette of felt sensation requisite for the execution of Dumas’ choreographic material. Dumas speaks of ‘a body  available to movement’ versus a body  trained in classical techniques. A ‘body available to movement’ is a body  that can adapt to new physical requirements of emergent movement vocabularies quite apart from the way in which  a classical dancer has to adapt in the moment to perform familiar moves  assembled from the fixed lexicon of ballet.  Dumas’  work  also capitalizes on the intense mobility of a body which  is not stabilized via held muscularity, calling for what  he calls the ‘management of instability’. Management is the job of the dancer — not control,  rather riding the wave of movement. Given that Dumas’  work  also aims to aesthetically evoke the ease associated with  walking (the ease of the everyday), felt sensation and skill is pretty much  all that the dancer has to call upon. A body  available to movement aims to feel the sensations implicit in movement. In Whitehead’s parlance,
