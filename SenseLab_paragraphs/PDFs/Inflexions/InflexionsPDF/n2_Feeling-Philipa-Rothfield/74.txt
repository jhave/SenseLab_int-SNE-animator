[1] Whitehead writes  of the many  coming  together, conjoining in the production of newness, in the creation of the novel entity,  and  of the sense in which  the novel entity  then becomes  one of the many,  the new many,  as it were — “The ultimate metaphysical principle is the advance from disjunction to conjunction, creating a novel entity  other  than  the entities given in disjunction. The novel entity  is at once the togetherness of the ‘many’ which  it finds,  and  also it is one among the disjunctive ‘many’ which  it leaves”  (Whitehead, 1960: 32).
