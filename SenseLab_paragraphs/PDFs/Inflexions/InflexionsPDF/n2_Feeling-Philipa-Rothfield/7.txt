I had somewhat of an epiphany the other  day. Something appeared in the feeling of dancing some choreographic material that was hitherto lacking.  It had  been suggested to me that I needed to ‘author’ my dancing, that what  I was doing  was just performing my failure  to dance  the material. It certainly felt like that; an emotionally wrought, inner  emptiness populated by doomed, episodic attempts to get this bit right,  that bit right.  By a series of happenstance, something
emerged inside  my dancing body.  I was not authoring anything. But deep  inside, there  was a thickness of feeling which  I felt. It permeated my torso. If I pushed
out of the ground from a bend/plié, I could  feel that deep  inside  get pushed from the ground. A series of playful, thick-from-the-inside activities ensued.  Moments before, I had desperately claimed that I really was ‘looking for the feeling’.
“Listen  to yourself”, Russell said, “You’re ‘looking’ for the feeling”.  “OK, (I was
reading Whitehead), I’m feeling for the feeling.”  Then it came.
What happened?
