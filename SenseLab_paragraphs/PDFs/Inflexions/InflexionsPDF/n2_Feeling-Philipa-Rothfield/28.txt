The incredible specificity of dance  can be framed in terms  of elimination and integration — the sum of Whitehead’s categoreal obligations numbers one to three. The categoreal obligations are a series of propositions which  embody Whitehead’s philosophy of process.   They are general expressions which, together, specify his account of process, prehension, actual  entities  and feeling. They are similar  to mathematical or logical axioms  in their attempt to define  their subject. Donald Sherburne writes  that “it has been suggested that they are similar to Kant’s categories, except that they operate throughout the world instead of merely in the experience of conscious persons.  They are conditions of all
possible actual  worlds, rather than  merely conditions of all possible experience.”
