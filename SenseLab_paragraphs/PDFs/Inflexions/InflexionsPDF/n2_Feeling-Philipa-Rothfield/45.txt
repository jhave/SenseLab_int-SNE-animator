The management of instability is not simply the breadth of possibility facilitated by letting  go of muscularity and keeping to a narrow base. It also calls for a certain kind  of attenuation which  ballet by and  large foregoes. [17] Erin Manning has spoken of something similar  in the execution of tango,  a form which  she also predicates upon the ease of walking, and  according to which  the zone between the looming step and its satisfaction is kept alive. [18] There is a concrete skill at work  in the evocation of a potential field surrounding the ultimate inevitability
of the step. This field must  be invoked through the articulation of concrete
possibility. Can Whiteheadâ€™s work  assist in accounting for this important texture?
