folding occurs via a feeling’s journey, which  transforms the ‘initial data’ of the given  to the ‘objective datum’ of the past. In the process, the feeling thereby becomes  the subjectivity of a new occasion  in the process of its becoming. The folding of a new subjectivity is also an unfolding of past subjectivities into
‘objective immortality’. Thus the pleating and unfolding motion continues in
‘rhythmic’ fashion.
