On the  other  hand with  the  incandescent light  bulb,  I am  completely tied  to its iconic shape, to the heat  it gives out,  to the attack  of the tungsten filament, to its colour  temperature, to  its  short  life  span.  The  moment the  incandescent light bulb  no longer  exists that  piece should die. I don’t believe  in vampire art. I very much  believe  in the honorable death of artworks. The incandescent light  bulb  is banned now  in half  of the  world and  it will be banned here  too  soon.  Some  of Dan Flavin’s coloured fluorescent tubes  were  also banned, but because they were seriously  toxic.   The  incandescent  light   bulb   is  being   banned  because  it  is inefficient. I fundamentally think  that  in the future, people will have  an artisanal production  for  artworks  like  mine   and   many   other   people  who   work   with incandescent light.  For  this  reason, the  typology of blown  glass,  inert  gas  and tungsten filament will always be preserved.
