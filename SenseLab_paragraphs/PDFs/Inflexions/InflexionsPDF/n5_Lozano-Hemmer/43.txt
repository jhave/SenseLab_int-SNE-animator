Conservation seems  to be an issue  that  I have  now  when museums acquire my work.  I believe  that  ultimately it is the  artist  who  needs  to make  the  decisions about  their  commitment in a particular technolog y. Take for example Nam  June Paik’s  piece  where a  Buddha  watches himself  on  a  short  circuit  TV monitor. Many  of his  pieces  were  about  the  importance of the  cabinet.  The  question is does  that  piece  die  in  thirty or  fifty  years  when the  TV  monitor  cannot be repaired?  Can  a  current  flat  screen   replace   the  cabinet   and   does   it  matter? Perhaps this  particular work  is about  the  circularity of vision,  not  the  cabinet? The  only  one  who  can  really  answer that  is Nam  June  Paik  himself,  and  he is dead. So in light  of that,  whenever I make  a piece  I very  carefully specify  which parts  can and  should be replaced easily.  When  Tate acquired my  piece  Subtitled Public (http://www.lozano-hemmer.com/subtitled_public.php), they  wanted spare  projectors in case any  broke.  But I consider this  is more  like Sol LeWitt’s Art  of Instructions.  As far as I am concerned, for this  piece  you  can generate the same  experience with  whatever projectors  come  up  in  the  future, which  will probably have even more  resolution.
