I can think  of no more  elegant, poetic  and effective   way   to  connect   with   something  as  tragic   as  the  holocaust  as  this absence.  Itâ€™s beautiful. The piece that  was just done  for the  Vancouver Olympics, Vectorial Elevation (http://www.lozano-hemmer.com/vectorial_elevation.php) is really  about  projecting  an  absence.  Those  people who  are  participating are  not there.  There    is   an   incredible  construction   with    an   overlapped  sense    of transactions taking   place  in  virtuality and  networks overlaid onto  real  space. These   two   things  can,   should  and   do   coexist.   They   can   be   experienced simultaneousl y.
