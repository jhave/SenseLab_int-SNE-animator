RLH: That's  right.  Except  for Voz Alta and  a few other  pieces,  I have  often  been criticized for not being  political  enough. My answer to that  is, although I admire their  work,  I am not political  in the same  way  that  Krzysztof Wodiczko or Hans Haacke are.  I  find  that  it  is  very  important to  work   with   micropolitics: the personal politics  of,  for  example, a  vintage punk guy  meeting an  evangelical Christian  and   having  an  experience  to  share   or  maybe   talk.   I  don't  think addressing the political  explicitly is something I can do. I have  no moral  lessons. Obviously I have  a position, but  that's  is not  something that  I try  to push onto people.
