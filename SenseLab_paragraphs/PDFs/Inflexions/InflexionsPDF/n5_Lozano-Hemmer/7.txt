MPB & PH: Our initial concept for this issue of Inflexions was to consider the idea of aesthetics in action. According to Gilbert Simondon, aesthetics is never determined. Rather, it is a tendency that has the power to reticulate the primitive state of magical unity.  This power of reticulation – or networking–  is essential to understanding  the relationship between technology and aesthetics. To us, your work does not instantiate Simondon’s thought but actually performs it. By staging complex events, technology is neither  celebrated nor  is  it  transformed  it  into  an  aesthetic tool. Rather,  you  elicit powerful relations between technology and history while beautifully highlighting the operational form of aesthetics. Your work speaks to what Brian Massumi refers to when he valorizes the idea of staging situations by working with enabling constraints. As in the theatre, one must  initiate by creating conditions that enable or constrain the emergence of different modes of being that are neither random nor predetermined. Could you explain how such an approach to the production of art speaks to you?
