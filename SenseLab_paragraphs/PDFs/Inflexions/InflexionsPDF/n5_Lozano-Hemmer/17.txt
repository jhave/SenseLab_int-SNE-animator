MPB  & PH:  The political seems to somehow percolate to the public space based on interaction. Even though you qualify some of your pieces as being relational, especially the Relational Architecture series, you still address interactive themes. In other words, you challenge the boundaries between interactive and relational art. At the same time you tackle  the  traditional  narratives  associated with  interactive  art.  By  breaking  with linearity and by using transformation and variation as conditioners of relationality you not only negate but also reconfigure the traditional linear correlations between actions and reactions. You use a lot of mathematics and algorithms to make visible the qualities of lived relations and the staging of conditions for undetermined events. In light of this, could you explain how you engage with  the difference between interactivity  and relationality?
