RLH: The dualisms that  really  matter to me  are  those  of absence  and  presence. These two things are not antagonistic. They are inseparable. There is a really fascinating field  of vacuum studies. A vacuum, by definition, is a place  where there  is nothing. In space  we  can  approximate a true  vacuum where there  are only a couple  of particles. According to quantum mechanics, if at any given  time you take a snapshot of a vacuum where there  is “nothing” there  is a probabilistic intensity  of  quantum  activity   where  matter  and   anti   matter  are   constantly shooting off in opposite directions. A vacuum is a site of immense quantum mechanical activity.  It’s just that  it is so brief, and  that  in that  interval it collapses onto  itself under Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. What  we observe is the net effect of nothingness. The idea that the vacuum does not exist and  that absence  is in  fact  a site  of intense presence is metaphorically an  important a part  of my work.  Sometimes this absence  is performed very simply such as in the neon  sign Entanglement (http://www.lozano-hemmer.com/entanglement.php) where you turn  it on and it immediately connects you to an other  place.
