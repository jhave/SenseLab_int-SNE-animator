The third use of the concept of relational emerged in the seventies with  the idea of the  relational database. To me,  technically, this  is the  most  interesting thing, because the idea of the database is that  a quantum of information can be filtered, sorted and  reconfigured. A relational database is the  same  as a database, except networked and  with  wormholes that  allow  databases to fold  into  each  other,  or to be recursive. They allow a database to become  a performative platform.
