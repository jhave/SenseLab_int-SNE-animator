I encountered the  word relational through the  work  of Brazilian  artists,  Lygia Clark  and  HÃ©lio  Oiticica.  These  artists  were  pioneers in the sixties  and  seventies of  relational  objects,   sculptures  and   installations  that   were   intended  to  be manipulated and  played with.  To me  the  word relational, as I heard it, had  a horizontality that  maybe  Simondon was  talking about  where the  aesthetics are opposed  to  the   interface.  This  challenges  the   insistence  that   virtuality  and materiality are mirror images  of each other.  These things are co-present, so relationality allowed me to think  of the computer and  technology as a potential language with  which  you can make  relationships emerge, as opposed to pre- conceiving the outcomes.
