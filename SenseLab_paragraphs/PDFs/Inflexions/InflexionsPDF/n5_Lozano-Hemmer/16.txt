premise  that   broadcast  permits  were   needed,  the  Mexican   government  had banned and  shut  down informal radio  stations in Chiapas and  Guerrero because they  didnâ€™t  like  it  when indigenous communities set  up  cohesive agencies   of technologies. While the piece does not offer a solution to the problem of access to the  electromagnetic spectrum,  it  does   allow   one  to  visualize  this  otherwise hidden public  space.  We  recently presented  the  project  in  London's Barbican Centre.  London has had  an intense tradition of pirate radio.  Many  important DJs come from  the informal, uncontrolled radio  transmissions of pirate radio.  To me the  question of public  space,  of course,  extends to architectural space,  but  also extends to the internet and  the electromagnetic spectrum. It becomes  richer  than a geometric question. It becomes  a question of other  kinds  of networks.
