MPB & PH:  You spoke eloquently about absence, but what about presence? In works, such as Solar Equation (http://www.lozano-hemmer.com/solar_equation.php) you seem to be looking to take something absent and invisible from our phenomenological experience such as the sunâ€™s rays or the even the astronomical scale and bring it into the present. What is remarkable about Solar Equation is that it was brought into the civic sphere, more or less at the scale of a building.  This  connects the piece to our civic institutions,  which inevitably makes it public. How do you see this question of taking absence and making it present?
