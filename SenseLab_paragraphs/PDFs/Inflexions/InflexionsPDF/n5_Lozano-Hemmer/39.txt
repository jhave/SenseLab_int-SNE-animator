In  a virtual helmet, you  are  asked  to  become  small  to  pretend that  displayed virtual buildings are  real.  There  is a suspension of disbelief in order to believe that  is  happening. In  Relational Architecture  we  are  doing the  exact  opposite where we amplify the presence of an individual participant to an urban scale. In this case, it is the buildings that  are pretending to be what  they  are not. Mexico’s Zocalo square is the third largest  in the world. It fits 260,000 people. In any given day  there  are  three  protests on the  square, but  the  size is so huge  that  nothing really  happens there.  It is specifically designed, in  terms  of scale,  to  allow  for protests to happen, but its scale drowns them  out. The very first time I used searchlights to  amplify individual  expressions at  an  urban scale  were  in  that context.    Churchill   said,    “we    make    buildings   and    buildings   make    us.” Globalization has  subverted that  relationship. A building that  is  built  here  is going   to   be   identical  to   one   in   Singapore  or   Mexico   City.   Rather    than representing citizenr y,  it  represents capital.   Buildings are  designed to  be  cost effective,  formulaic and  modularized. Anything that  we can do  to interrupt the narrative of homogeneity and  to create  this eccentric  moment of unpredictability is the democratic potential of the work.
