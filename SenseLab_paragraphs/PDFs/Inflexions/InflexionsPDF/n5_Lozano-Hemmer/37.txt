RLH: What  attracted me to Solar Equation was  the  possibility of visualizing the complex mathematics embedded in the  turbulence in the  sun.  That  fascination came  out  the  research that  we  have  been  doing here  in the  studio. We look  at materials, equations and  especially mathematical  concepts that  have  emerged over  the  last  fifty  years  such  as  fractals,  reaction-diffusion,  Navier-Stokes and fluid  dynamics. We are sitting  on a moment where math  is legitimating an entire movement  of  art   similar   to  the   era   when  Brunelleschi  first   worked  with perspective. Interactivity is dominated by two  modes:  causal  or random. Today we  can  look  at these  non-linear dynamic equations and  create  experiences that are neither preprogrammed nor arbitrary. Although a lot of people saw this piece very  scientifically, nobody is pretending that  this  is a scientific  model of representation. This is a performance event.
