RLH: I have  a background in sciences. So I always felt that  science was a place of very  intense experimentation and  absolutely weird and  beautiful phenomena. Even  as I studied quantum mechanics things like the  uncertainty principle, the duality of light, the impossibility of a vacuum, and  other  phenomena were inexplicable to me. Non-linear dynamics with  its recursive algorithms, cellular automata, fractals,  and  so many  other  mathematics were  developed to create enormous   complexity.  When   I  joined   the   art   world,  the   whole    field   of interactivity was being  developed in a way that  I would call Pavlovian. It was all about   a  trigger mentality.  We  used   to  call  it  1-bit  interaction, like  an  on/off
