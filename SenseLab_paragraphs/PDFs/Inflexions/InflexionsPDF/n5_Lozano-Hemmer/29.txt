RLH: I am coming  very firmly  from a position (one that I think  is very Canadian, even  before  McLuhan) that  technology is not  something that  is outside of our body  but  that  is part  of us, like McLuhan’s “second skin”.  Even  if you  live in a remote area  of the planet and  have  never  made  a phone call, your  country exists in a globalized economy dependent on virtual capital,  your  language is about  to disappear,  and   your   environment  is   deteriorating.  We   are   all   part   of   a technological  culture.  I  often  say  that   I  work   with   technology  because  it  is inevitable. The last person to try to be outside of technology was Pol Pot, and  he did  not do so well. It is just as coherent to say that  technology is a language. And as a language it’s not neutral, it has its biases and  its properties. We can’t imagine the  world without technology;  just  as  a  phenomenologists, such  as  Merleau– Ponty,  suggested that  we couldn’t imagine what  pre verbal  thought was because we  need  language to get there.  If the  public  watch  eight  hours of screen-time a day,  then  there  is no way  that  those  screens  cannot assumed to be part  of their body.  The iPod  plays  the music  that  I already like, and  that  reaffirms who  I am. As  far  as  the  subject   of  technology  and   the  individual  is  concerned,  these possessive, prosthetic extensions of our  perception have  been  dealt  with  quite well.  The ones  that  haven’t dealt  with,  and  I am interested in exploring through my work,  are the ones with  more  connective spaces.  You will notice  in my work that I rarely  have just one robot.  Rather  than  a singular robot,  I am interested in a community of robots  interacting or relating to another layer of connection.
