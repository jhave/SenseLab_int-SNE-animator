I  started  calling   my   work   relational  in  1995.  Although  Nicolas   Bourriaud published Relational Art in 1997, it’s got nothing to do with  what  I’ve been talking about.   I  find  his  work   was  more   about   the  moment of  artistic   creation and presentation. My work  is about  the  moment of the  event  itself  and  its creation through perception and  participation. My works  are always, by definition, unfinished  as  they   are  presented, and   quite   honestl y,  many   times   they   fail, sometimes quite  beautifully. If people don’t  engage with  the  work  there  is no work.
