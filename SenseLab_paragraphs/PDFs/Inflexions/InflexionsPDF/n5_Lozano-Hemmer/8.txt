RLH: I like the term  "enabling constraints" it gives you the sense that  the work  is a platform to be taken-over. Platforms are great  if they  are understood as initial conditions,  as  starting points, as  spring-boards. Another way  to  see  it  is  to consider success  not  the  creation of  a  specific  piece  but  the  emergence of  a specific public.  In art, both randomness and  predetermination are impossibilities, misnomers. In art all you have is emergence, apparitions, which  by definition can neither be random nor predetermined.
