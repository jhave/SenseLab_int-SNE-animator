So the idea for me was to reveal  that and make  it current. The question of making this  event  beautiful is one  of creating an entitlement and  a relationship to your surroundings. I don't have  a problem saying  that  my  work  is a special  effect. There  is this  intention of amplification to an urban scale.  Yet although its there, it's  very  frail,  ephemeral, and   has  a  tendency to  disappear.  Strategically the pieces  are  platforms  for  participation where  the  relationship to  the  political history of  the  site  is  as  important as  the  microrelational event   between two people who meet in the space and  pass a microphone from one to the other.
