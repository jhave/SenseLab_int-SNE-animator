The  first  time  I  did   a  very  large  shadow  play,  Re:positioning  Fear (http://www.lozano-hemmer.com/repositioning_fear.php),  for   a  military arsenal in Graz,  Austria, I thought of the shadow as an expressionistic, perverse Murnau scene  of  otherness and  subconscious fear.  Yet from  the  moment we opened it, everybody started playing and  having a great  time. It was really  a carnivalesque kind  of scene.  I thought ok,  I BLEW IT!! This  has  nothing to do with   fear.   Yet  the   next   time   I  worked  with   shadows,  we   leveraged  that performative side  of embodiment at an  urban scale.  In my  work,  the  relational aspect   comes   out   of  the   emergence  of  new   relations  and   new   connections between disparate  realities. There  is  a  real  sense  of  empiricism and experimentality that  can  allow  things to happen. Once  a project  is out  there,  I often  feel that  a fundamental element of my work  should be that  it is out  of my control.  If it is in my control,  then  I have failed miserably.
