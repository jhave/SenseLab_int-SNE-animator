In public  art I often work  backwards, in a parasitic mode,  in order to understand the  type  of  practical and   technological constraints  that  are  presented with  a particular  commission, and  I meet  local  eccentrics, stake-holders,  neighbours. Having said  that,  my  work  is rarely  site-specific. These  contextual insights are tangential starting  point   that   lead  to  something  that's   quite   alien.  I  use  the concept of alien  memory too denote something that's  familiar but  that  does  not belong.   While   it  is  accommodated  into   a  site   everybody  is  aware  of  its artificiality.
