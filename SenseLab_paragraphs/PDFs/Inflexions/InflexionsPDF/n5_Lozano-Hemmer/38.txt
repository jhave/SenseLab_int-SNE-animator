I wanted this piece to evoke landscapes of mystery and  paradox, an ode to Blake. I think  that  the images  that  we got of the solar surface  in the 90’s defined our era in same  way that  the image  of the earth  was the definitive image  of the 60’s. The Sun  is violent,  completely out  of control,  gives  life, creates  all of the  elements, and  causes  global  warming. The piece  is a scale  model 100 million  to one  and there  is a sense  of distance and  irony,  which  I also hope  came  through. There  is something about  the  processing of scaling  that  is fascinating and  humbling.  A long time ago I read  a discussion by Derrida, in The Truth and Painting, where he talks  about  the sublime as being  very  small,  in contrast to Kant's  understanding of it as very  large.  Very  large  and  very  small  are  inseparable. The processes of amplification are always at work  with  any kind  of scaling.
