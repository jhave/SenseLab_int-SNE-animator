There  are  times  in these  commissions where the  relationship of the  participants or the public  can be a political  memory. A good  example is Voz Alta (http://www.lozano-hemmer.com/voz_alta.php),   the   memorial  for   the   1968
Tlatelolco  student massacre in Mexico City.  In those  cases I try  to approach the work  in an  anti-monumental way.  The challenge of Voz Alta was  to remember what  happened, but  not  in a necrophiliac way,  where we  assume that  memory can be recalled independently. So I try to think  about  a language that  evokes  this tragedy and  activates the memories without being  exhaustive about  that representation. Instead, I turn  the emphasis onto  a living  public  that  may  create new    memories  and    relationships,   including   connections  to   contemporary massacres that are taking  place today.
