Pulse Room (http://www.lozano-hemmer.com/pulse_room.php) was  developed for  the  very  first  automated factory  in  Latin  America:  Puebla's La Constancia textile  factor y.  This  was  also  one  of the  first  factories  with  incandescent light bulbs.   It  really   spoke   to  that   particular  time   of  modernity.  The  light   bulb manifested this new  energy called  electricity, and  is now  the icon of an idea.  The bulb  is also absence  and  presence. It is an interface between an inert  gas and  our own  air. There  a hundred different precedents in art that  refer  to the bulb,  such as Marcel  Duchamp filling  a light  bulb  with  the  air of Paris  or Jack Goldstein's performance with  a beating light  bulb.  The problem is not  how  to preserve Art but how to perpetrate it.
