RLH: I’ve thought a lot about  light. I am not so much  interested in the materiality of light, but the space of light.  Every visual  artist  works  with  light. I was recently at  a conference called  the  Meaning  of Light. Everyone was  referring to  light  as enlightening and  spiritual. As a Quaker artist,  I admired James  Turrell  searches for an inner  light, which  is great.  My interest in light however, is in the light used by American border choppers to find  Mexicans.  The light  of interrogations. The light  of the sun's  explosions. My parents were  nightclub owners in Mexico City. To me  light  is artificiality. It’s  connected to drugs and  hallucinations. I have  a real  carnivalesque understanding  of it as  opposed to  something spiritual. It is also controllable, malleable and  ephemeral. I work  with  light to create  parties. So I am most comfortable working with  disco lights.
