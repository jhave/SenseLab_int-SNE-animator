over  the course of multiple generations of a bioengineered technical object (for example,  interactions   between   multiple   generations   of   the   bioengineered technical object  and  its associated milieu  may  produce new  forms  of recurrent causality  which   depend upon this  bioengineered  technical  object,  and   upon which  this bioengineered technical object comes to depend). As this list suggests, bioengineering is often  a matter of exploiting existing  developmental processes that  are  largely  allowed to proceed according to their  own  immanent logic – a fact  that  may  seem  to  render  biotechnical objects  less  “inventive” than  those turbines, motors, and  electronic components with  which  Simondon exemplified his  concept of  associated milieu.   Yet the  reliance   of  bioengineers on  existing patterns of recurrent causality does  not  prevent bioengineering from  facilitating the  emergence of  new   and   unexpected patterns  of  recurrent  causality, both within the organism and  between the organism and  the common miliex, and  this in  turn   enables   precisely  those   discoveries  of  new   modes  of  compatibility between different dimensions of  natural forces  and   materials that  Simondon stressed in his account of non-biological technical objects.
