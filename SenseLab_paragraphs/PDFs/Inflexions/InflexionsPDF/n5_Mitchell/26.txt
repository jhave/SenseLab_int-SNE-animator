For Simondon, the virtue of the concept of the associated milieu  for the study of technology is that  it enables  a distinction between two  quite  different kinds  of technical  objects.   A  technical  individual   is  a  technical  object   that   has   “an associated milieu  as  a  sine  qua  non  condition of  its  functioning”; a  technical ensemble, by contrast, has at least “two  distinct parts  that  cannot be self-stabilized by the  same  associated milieu” (Simondon 2001: 61, 62 [Mellamphy 68, 71]). At stake  in this distinction is the question of whether the separate elements of a technical  object  must   be  largely   sealed   off  from   another  in  order  prevent unexpected  changes  in   one   element  from   impeding  the   function  of  other elements,  or  whether  –  as  in  the  example of  the  air-cooled  engine   above   – fluctuations in one element actually promote the functioning of another element. In the case of technical ensembles, each element of the technical object in a sense functions  as  part   of  the   external  milieu   of  the  other   elements;  though  the elements of necessity interact with  one another, the ensemble is able to function only  by “preventing the  chance  creation of associated milieu” (Simondon 2001:
64  [Mellamphy  72]).  By  contrast,  “[s]tructures  connected  with   one   single associated  milieu   should  operate  synergetically”  (Simondon  2001:  62 [Mellamphy  70,  72]).  A  technical individual  is  not  “better” than   a  technical ensemble – and  in fact the  elements of a technical ensemble are  often  technical individuals – but  the distinction nevertheless allows  for a precise  analysis of the sites and functions of self-regulation and recurrent causality in technical objects.
