“devolution” that  have a directionality more  or less precisely the opposite of that which  we observe in technical evolution. Thus,  in place  of that  movement from an initially incoherent system of functions toward a coherent system of functions that  characterizes technical evolution, we instead find  that  an “initially coherent system of biological functions” becomes  broken into  “functions that  are independent  of  each  other   and   that   are  related to  one  another only  by  the gardener’s care.” [8]
