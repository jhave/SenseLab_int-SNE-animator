[7] See also  the  translation in  (Brouwer and  Mulder, eds.  2007: 57). Simondon goes so far as to say that  “[o]nly  those  technical objects that  require an associated milieu  in order to function may  properly be called  inventions” (Simondon 2001:
59 [Mellamphy 60]). I have  altered the  translation above  slightly, because both
Mellamphy and  the  translator of the  piece  in Interact or Die introduce the  term “environment,” which  does  not appear in the French  and  arguably confuses the matter. For  a discussion of the  importance of the  distinction between “milieu” and  “environment” in early  twentieth-century  biological and  social  philosophy, see Pollmann forthcoming.
