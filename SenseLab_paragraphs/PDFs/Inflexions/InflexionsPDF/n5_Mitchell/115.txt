[8] I make  use of the qualifiers “at least in some  cases”  and  “in the case of some kinds” in order to acknowledge that  Simondon is not  critical  of what  we might call traditional agricultural practices (Simondon 2001: 89ff.). What  seems  to distinguish these  latter  from  greenhouse and  laboratory practices for Simondon is that in the case of traditional practices, humans accommodate their  activities to the   associated  milieu   within  which   plants  (and   animals)  have   traditionally grown, rather than  creating new milieu.
