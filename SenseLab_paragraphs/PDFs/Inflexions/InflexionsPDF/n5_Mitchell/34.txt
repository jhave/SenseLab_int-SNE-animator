Though Simondon draws his term  milieu  from  biological and  physiological discourses,  he   also   consistently  argues  that   we   should  not   simply  equate technical  objects  and   living   organisms,  emphasizing  that   though  a  concrete technical object is like a natural object, there  is in fact little to be gained by taking this  parallel too  seriously. He  is emphatic, in fact,  that  we  should not  think  of concrete technical objects  as fundamentally the  same  as “living  beings,” and  he raps  cybernetics on  the  knuckles for  going  too  far  in this  direction (Simondon
2001: 70-1 [Mellamphy 82-3]). He argues, for example, that machines do not pose themselves “problems,” and  as a consequence, there  is no action  of the future on the  present in the  case of the  machine (Simondon 2001: 144-45 [Rebolledo et al.
144-45]).
