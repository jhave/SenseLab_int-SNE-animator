In daring gallery-goers to press  the red button, Transgenic Bacteria Release Machine is drawing upon both  the  active  bodily  capacities of the  gallery-goer as well  as the ability  of the human body  to serve as a medium, in the biological sense of the term.  Rather  than  asking  us to adopt a silent, distant gaze in front of the work,  as one might  take before,  say, a painting that  depicts transgenic monstrosities, installation art  such  as  Transgenic Bacteria Release Machine encourages gallery- goers  to walk  around the work  and  physically engage it (in this case by pressing
– or  not  pressing – a button). From  this  perspective, Transgenic Bacteria Release Machine initially appears to  the  spectator as  a relatively mundane part  of that associated milieu  that the spectator, as a living  individual, is perpetually co- producing through his  or  her  actions.   Yet Transgenic Bacteria Release Machine solicits   these   intentional  bodily   actions   in  order  to  bring   the   existence   of associated milieu   into  at  least  partial  awareness, for  the  project  exploits   the gallery-goer’s  sense   of  the  possibility  of  being   infected  by  the  “release”  of bacteria in  order to  emphasize the  biological dependency  of  the  body  on  the spaces  in which  it moves.  By focusing the gallery-goer’s active  bodily  capacities on  the  red  button, Transgenic Bacteria Release Machine positions the  air  in  the gallery  space as a biological vector – that is, as something that may link the E. coli in the petri  dish to the inside  of my body  – while  at the same time positioning the gallery-goer’s body  as biological medium for the E. coli. By “biologizing” the air,
