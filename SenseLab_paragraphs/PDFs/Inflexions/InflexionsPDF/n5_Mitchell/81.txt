Potentially this work  presents a future in which  there  will be meat (or protein rich food)  for vegetarians and  the killing  and  suffering of animals destined for food consumption will be reduced. Furthermore, ecological  and  economical problems associated with the  food  industry (hence,  growing grains  to feed  the  animals and keeping them  in basic conditions) can be reduced dramatically.
