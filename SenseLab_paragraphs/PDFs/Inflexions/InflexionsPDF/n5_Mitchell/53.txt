also render those  plants less tasty) (Kloppenburg 2004: 296, 301). [13] In addition, the specific traits  upon which  corporations involved in plant  genetic  engineering have  focused are generally those  that  align  well  with  the sale of other  products, such  as herbicides, since this coordination of products allows  the same  company to sell both  seed  and  the complementary herbicide that  kills all plant  life except the herbicide-resistant crop. Though corporate research and development may depend upon this  economic framing of research, there  is no  a priori  reason to think  that  such  a framework is likely  to  encourage researchers to  develop the logic(s)  of  biotechnology  to  their   fullest   extent.   Despite all  these  difficulties, though, recombinant DNA  techniques nevertheless make  it possible, at least  in principle, to approach living  beings  as existing  coherent systems of biological functions  that   can   be  altered  to  produce  new,   and   potentially  even   more coherent, systems of biological functions – and  from this perspective, it is at least plausible to treat  living  beings  as technical objects,  in Simondon’s sense  of that term,  and  to consider how  and  when biotechnologies depended upon associated milieu.
