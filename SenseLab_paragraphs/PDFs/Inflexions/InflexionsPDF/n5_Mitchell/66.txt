“Bioart”  is, admittedly, a contested term,  with  some  critics  using  it to  refer  to works  of art  that  engage the  theme of biotechnology, while  others  restrict  it to those  works  of art that employ bioengineered tissue  or organisms as the medium of the artwork. In the interests of space, I consider here only artworks that situate living  beings  or tissues  – for example, microorganisms such  as E. coli or tissue cultures drawn from  larger   organisms – in  the  space  of  the  art  gallery.   [18] Examples of such  works  include Marta  da  Menezes’s Nature, which  presents in the  art  gallery  butterflies that  she  technologically altered at  the  embryo stage; Eduardo Kac’s  Genesis project,  which  creates  in  the  art  gallery  an  asscociated milieu  for genetically-altered E. coli; and  Disembodied Cuisine, in which  the Tissue Culture and  Art Project  drew on techniques of biological tissue  culture in order to grow  frog muscle  cells around a template in the form of a steak,  creating what the  group describes as  a  “semi-living” object,  which   was  then  flambéed and eaten  in a collective  meal at the end of the gallery  exhibition (figs. 2 and  3).
