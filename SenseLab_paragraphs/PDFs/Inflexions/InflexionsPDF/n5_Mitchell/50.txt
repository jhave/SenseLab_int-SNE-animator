or  x-ray   mutations  of  germplasm  (see,  e.g.,  Kloppenburg  2004). Multigenerational breeding programs depend on the  identification of one  (or at most  a very  small  number) of desirable traits,  and  breeding for those  traits  not only takes many  generations, but also makes  it difficult  to predict how  the intensification of a given  trait  will  affect other  traits.  In similar  fashion, though chemical  or x-ray  mutations produce changes more  swiftly  (and  in some  cases, more  predictably), they  are  also  coarse  means   of  changing heredity, for  they produce changes that are difficult  to restrict  to the trait of interest.
