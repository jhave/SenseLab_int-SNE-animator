of the  capacities of a given  line  of plants, it would be  equally possible to  see cultivation  within   greenhouses   or   laboratories   as   an   enlargement   of   the geographic spread of the  species.  That  is, insofar  as instances of the  species  still flourish in the  original geographic locale  from  which  they  were  taken,  the  fact that other  instances now  grow  in protected conditions (i.e., in greenhouses or laboratories) in parts  of the world in which  the plant  would otherwise be unable to  grow  represents a  geographic expansion of  the  species  itself.  Significantly, both  of these  points – that  living  beings  can survive in multiple milieu,  and  that cultivation  can   be  understood  as  an   enlargement  of  vital   geography—are consistent with  Simondon’s emphasis in L’Individuation on the links that  a living being  necessarily retains with  the pre-individual, which  means  that  an organism is always in excess of itself, and  thus  always retains the capacity for new forms of linkage with  its  milieu.  [10] Yet in  Du  mode, Simondon’s  desire  to  distinguish between biological and  technical evolution seems  to  have  trumped his  earlier claims about  the fundamental openness of living organisms.
