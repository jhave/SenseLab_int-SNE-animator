Simondon provides some  of the  tools  for such  a rethinking, for in Du mode, he argues that  art  should understood first  and  foremost as mediation. Simondon’s reflections on the  relationship between art  and  technology, relatively unknown in the  English-speaking world, share  some  characteristics with  those  of Martin Heidegger and  Walter  Benjamin:  like the  former, Simondon understands  art  as both  something like  a  “clearing” and  a  mode   of  mutual imbrication between “earth” and  “world,” and  like  the  latter,  he  emphasizes the  peculiar mode  of presence attached to older  works  of art (Heidegger 1971 and  Benjamin  1968). Yet Simondon  was   far  more   knowledgeable  about   technical  objects   than   either Heidegger or Benjamin,  and  the result  is a philosophy of art arguably better  able to deal with both the “gathering-together” and  the “aura” of the work  of art.
