Like much  contemporary installation or multimedia art, bioart  frequently emphasizes the  body  of gallery-goers, encouraging people to walk  around the work  of art and  perhaps even engage the work  through some sort of interface or device,  such  as an internet screen,  button, or portal (e.g., the  door  to the  dining space  in Disembodied Cuisine). However, bioart  almost  invariably encourages this embodied  engagement  with   the  work   of  art  in  order to  produce a  sense  of “becoming-medium” on  the  part  of a gallery-goer – that  is, a sense  that  one’s own  body  can become  an  associated milieu  for other  forms  of life. This  aim  of bioart  is exemplified in especially clear fashion by Beatriz da Costa’s and  Critical Art  Ensemble’s provocatively entitled Transgenic Bacteria Release Machine (2001–
3). Exhibited in 2003 at the  Museum of Natural History in London, Transgenic Bacteria Release Machine is an  installation-style bioartwork that  allowed gallery- goers  to press  a button, which  in turn  caused a robotic  arm  randomly to select
and  open  one of ten petri  dish covers (see fig. 4).
