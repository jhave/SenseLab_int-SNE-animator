changes are arguably simply an abstract reflex of this consumerist frame;  that  is,
a reflex  premised on  the  belief  that  we  are  currently virtuously human, despite whatever inequities capitalism might  engender, and  we thus  simply need  protect ourselves, via informed debate, from  those  consumerist choices  that  would lead us away  from being  properly human. For an account of human cloning  and reproductive engineering that  emphasizes the  links  with  consumerist discourse, see Silver 1998.
