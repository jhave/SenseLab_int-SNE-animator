Yet despite his emphasis on self-regulation and  recurrent causality, Simondon’s concept of “associated milieu” is not simply a repetition of Bernard’s extension of the   “internal  milieu”  to   non-living  objects,   for   the   associated  milieu   also functions as the ground for change and innovation. For Simondon, a milieu  is not simply  a  set  of  flows   that   preexists  an  individual,  but   rather  a  “synthetic grouping of two  or  more  levels  of reality  that  lack  communication before  [the event  of] individuation.” The associated milieu  of a technical individual enables a movement back and  forth  between a synthetic grouping of two  or more  levels of reality  that lack communication and  a synthetic grouping of two or more  levels of reality  that  communicate. To take  up  one  of Simondon’s  examples, when a Guimbal turbine is turned off, the water and  oil in the machine do nothing more than   facilitate   slow   heat   transfers  between  the   inside   and   outside  of  the technology. When  the  turbine is turned on, though, both  water and  oil become “plurifunctional,” enabling communication between different micro- and macrolevels of the device.  When  the turbine is again  turned off, the water and oil return to their  neutral state,  and  this cycling  between a neutral state  and  a state in which  water and  oil become  plurifunctional can  continue until  the  machine parts  wear  out.
