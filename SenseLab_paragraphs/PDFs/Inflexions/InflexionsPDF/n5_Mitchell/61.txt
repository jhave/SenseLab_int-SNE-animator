Not only does the concept of associated milieu  help us – despite Simondon’s own reservations – to think  biotechnology, but it also can serve as a critical resource in differentiating between good  and  bad  forms  of biotechnology. One can imagine, for example, a critique of product-driven approaches to genetic  engineering that proceeds from  a Simondonian (rather than  solely  “ecological”) point  of view.  In Du  mode,  for  example,  Simondon  bemoans  the   capture  of  certain   technical objects, such as automobiles, by the forces of fashion and  commerce. These latter add  “decorative features and  extra accessories” to the technical object in order to sell more  products. However, because these  features are decorative or accessory to the  technical object,  they  “wor[k] against the  essence  of the  technical being,” which   is  oriented toward  greater coherence of  functions  (Simondon 2001: 24 [Mellamphy 18]). Drawing on this line of thought, one could  critique strategies of genetic  modification that,  in  similar  fashion, produce those  “false  renovations which   commerce  requires  in   order  to   pretend  that   a  recent   object   is  an improvement on the  less recent” (Simondon 2001: 40 [Mellamphy 37]). Though this  critique would indeed involve the  charge  that  such  genetic  modifications make  a specific  plant  or  animal artificial  (in Simondon’s  sense  of that  term),  it would not  – pace Simondon’s explicit  claims  about  plants – imply  that  plants or animals cannot in principle be treated as technical objects.
