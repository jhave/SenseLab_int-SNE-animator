detach themselves from  the universe to which  they  adhere; the key points become  objective,  conserving only  their  functional character of  mediation, becoming instrumental,  mobile,  capable of  efficacy not just in a particular place and  not just in a particular moment: as figure,  the  key  points, detached from  the  foundation of which  the were    the    key,    become    technical   objects,    transportable   and abstracted from  the  milieu.  At the  same  time,  the  key  points lose their  mutual reticulation and  their  power of remote influence on the  reality  around them;  they  have,  as  technical objects,  only  an action   by  contact,   point   by  point,   instant by  instant (Simondon
2001: 167-68; my translation).
