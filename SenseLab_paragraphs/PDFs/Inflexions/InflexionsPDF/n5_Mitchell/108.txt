Whenever possible, I have  cited  Ninian Mellamphy’s unpublished translation of the first part  of this book as well as Felix Rebolledo’s, Charles Gagnon’s, and  Patrick  Harrop’s partial unpublished translation  of  second  and   third  parts   of  the   book;   page   numbers  to  these translations are indicated in brackets as “Mellamphy” or “Rebolledo et. al.,” followed by page  number. I have  also  in certain  cases  indicated page  numbers for the translation of the two small parts  of Simondon’s Du mode included in Joke Brouwer, Arjen Mulder, Brian Massumi, Detlef Mertins, Lars Spuybroek, Moortje Marres  and  Christian Hubler, Interact or Die: There Is Drama in the Networks (Rotterdam: NAi Publishers, 2007).
