Artificiality is something that  is within the  artificializing action  of man,  regardless of whether this action  affects a natural object or an entirely fabricated object. A greenhouse developed blossom that yields  petals  (a double flower)  but  does  not  engender fruit  is the product of a plant  that  has been  made  artificial.  Man  has deflected the  plant’s functions from  coherent performance to the  extent  that the   plant   can’t  reproduce  itself   except   by  procedures  such   as grafting  which   require  human  intervention.  Making  a  natural object  artificial   gives   results  that   differ   from   those   effected   by technical concretization. A plant  that  has  been  made  artificial  can only exist in that plant  laboratory, the greenhouse, with  its complex system of thermic and  hydraulic regulations. The initially coherent system of biological functions has been opened up to functions that are  independent of each  other  and  that  are  related to one  another only by the gardener’s care. Flowering becomes  pure  flowering, something detached and  anomic;  the  plant  blooms  until  it is worn out  and  it produces no seeds.  It loses  its original abilities  to resist cold,   drought  and   solar   heat.   The  artificial   regulations  of  the greenhouse replace  what  originally were the object’s natural regulations. Artificialization is a process of abstraction in the object which  is rendered artificial  (Simondon 2001: 47 [Mellamphy 47]).
