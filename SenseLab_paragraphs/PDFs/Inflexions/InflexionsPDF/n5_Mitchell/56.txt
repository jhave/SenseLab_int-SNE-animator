These   three   “sites”    of   biotechnological  associated  milieu    also   collectively emphasize the  temporal dimension of associated milieu.  That  associated milieu have  their  own  temporalities is implicit  in Simondon’s descriptions, all of which stress the ways  in which  associated milieu  coordinate multiple rates of change. In the  Guimbal turbine, for  example,“[t]he faster  the  turbine turns, the  more  the generator expels  heat,”  but  at the  same  time,  “the  more  the  oil in the  rotor  and water around the housing increase in turbulence ,” the more  this “activate[s] heat exchanges between rotor  and water effect and magnetic loss” (Simondon 2001: 57 [Mellamphy 61]). However, as the example of biotechnological objects highlights, the temporality of associated milieu  are not necessarily restricted to the relatively short  time frames  – minutes or hours – stressed by Simondon’s examples, but can also  unfold across  much  longer   time  frames,   such  as  days,  months, or  years. These longer  rhythms of associated milieu  are not necessarily specific to biotechnological  objects,  and   recent   attempts to  develop  “green” and “sustainable”  technologies are  arguably motivated by  the  attempt to  see  the long-term  relationship  between  a   non-living  technological  object   and   the
