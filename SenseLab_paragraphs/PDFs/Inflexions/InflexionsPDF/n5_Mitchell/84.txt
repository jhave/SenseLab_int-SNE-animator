human consumption in order to produce more  coherent ecological  systems: that is, systems in which  elements are  plurifunctional, rather than  systems in which the effects of one element have to be shielded from the effects of another element. By focusing on meat-production and  meat-eating, Disembodied Cuisine thus emphasizes not  only  the  question of  animal  suffering, but  also  those   linked systems of meat  production and  distribution that  enable  individuals in highly- industrialized societies  to eat meat  frequently, but  at the  cost of enormous (and generally government-subsidized)  outlays of  energy, land,   and   uses  of  long- distance  transportation  networks.  Rather   than   simply  taking   as  givens   the existing  elements of this assemblage – for example, traditional organisms such as cows; plots  of land  zoned as agricultural; distribution patterns focused on roads, waterways, and  air travel;  and  “consumers” – Disembodied Cuisine seeks to locate the functions that relate  to one another in this assemblage, and it does so in order to make  these  functions relate  to one  another more  efficiently;  that  is, it seeks  to facilitate  the emergence of biotechnological associated milieu  in place of what  are at present largely  ensembles, each  element of which  has  to treat  other  elements simply  as  “externalities.”  The  analytic approach  of  Disembodied Cuisine  –  its ability  to draw a distinction between organisms and  the  function of providing meat  – is thus  possible only because the project  is first and  foremost synthetic, in the  sense  that  it employs a specific  set of biotechnologies (biopolymer scaffolds and  tissue  culture) as a frame  on which  to allow  gallery-goers to begin  to map more  efficient  realignments of the  functions that  are  inherent in contemporary assemblages linking agricultural production, distribution, and  consumption. Whether  or  not  it  will  be  possible  to  “evolve”  these   assemblages  in  ways analogous to  the  evolutions of  technical objects  that  Simondon outlined is  of course  an open  question. However, by tracing a continuous, articulated line from the  inside  of  a biology  lab  to  social  rituals of  food  consumption, Disembodied Cuisine encourages the development of schemas that explore  this potential.
