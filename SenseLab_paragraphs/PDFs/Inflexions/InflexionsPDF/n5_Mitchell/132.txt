[27]  The  fact  that  the  living   components  of  bioart   projects   generally  do  not survive more  than  one exhibition – or at most,  a few exhibitions – emphasizes as well  the  “thisness” of  this  mode   of  art.  However, the  fragility of  bioart  also makes  the  sale  of bioartworks especially tricky,  since  it is often  not  clear  what, precisely, a collector  would be  purchasing after  the  end  of the  exhibition. (As Marta  de  Menezes noted to  me  in  the  course  of  a  videotaped interview, she solved  this  difficulty in the  case of Nature? by selling  to a gallery  the  biological protocol for recreating the butterflies in her bioartwork.)
