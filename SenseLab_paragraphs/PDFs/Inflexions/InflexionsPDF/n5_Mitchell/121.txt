[16] Simondon writes,  for example, that  “[w]hen a man  changes his old tool for a new tool that works  the same way, and is still able to reap the benefits of his apprenticeship, he  has  the  impression that  his  movements are  more  precise, more  agile, and  quicker:  the body’s schema as a whole  forces limits  to retreat, to be swept back, to free up; feelings  of awkwardness are reduced” (2001: 114 [Rebolledo et. al 114]). See, more  generally, the second section  of Du mode, “Man and  the Technical  Object,” (Simondon 2001: 85-152).
