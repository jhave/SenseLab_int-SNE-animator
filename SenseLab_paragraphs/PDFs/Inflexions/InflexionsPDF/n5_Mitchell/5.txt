1958) potentially challenge some  of the  fundamental categories of Simondon’s philosophy of technology. [2] It is not clear how,  if at all, practices of “immaterial labor”  would fit within Gilbert  Simondon’s accounts of individuation and technology (Toscano  2007). The development of the  field  of biotechnology also troubles Simondon’s approach to technology, for he drew a sharp distinction between machines and  living  beings,  and  restricted his philosophy solely  to the former. These two difficulties are arguably related to one another, for Simondon formulated the  key  elements of his  philosophy prior  to the  emergence of both our  contemporary information society  and  our  age of biotechnology. Simondon tended to focus  his understanding of the  connections between information and life through the  schema of cybernetics, and  no doubt as a consequence, his few remarks on  biotechnology are  generally lacking  in that  scrupulous attention to the material details of objects that  characterize his engagements with  other  forms of technology (e.g., bricks,  turbines, motors, diodes, etc.). Simondon suggests in Du mode, for example, that the use of living  matter as a technology, as in the case of  greenhouse flowers   and  fruits,  inevitably ends  up  rendering living  beings more  artificial  – that  is, more  “abstract”; more  dependent upon constant human intervention – and  he  buttresses this  claim  with  the  assertion that  greenhouse flowers  will  eventually be unable to  reproduce on  their  own  (Simondon 2001:
47). Whether or not  that  was  true  when Simondon wrote,  it certainly does  not seem  to be the case for bioengineered life in our  present moment, which  in turn makes    one   wonder  to   what    extent    his   philosophy   is   able   to   theorize contemporary transformations of living matter into technology.
