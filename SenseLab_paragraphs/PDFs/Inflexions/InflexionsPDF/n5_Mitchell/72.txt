One  of the  petri  dishes contained transgenic E. coli, and  thus,  by  pressing the button, a  gallery-goer  was  engaging in  a  sort  of  biological Russian  roulette, leaving it up  to chance  whether or not  he or she – and  the  rest  of the  gallery  – was  exposed to  the  transgenic bacteria. In  fact,  this  is  less  risky  than  it  may sound, since the E. coli cannot escape  from  the petri  dishes, and  the gallery environment itself was far more  dangerous for the E. coli than  the E. coli was for spectators.  Nevertheless,  it  is  not  hard to  imagine  that   even   the  bravest  of gallery-goers hesitated for a moment before  pressing the red button, overcoming a  bit  of  internal  resistance before   deciding to  take  a  chance   on  “releasing” bacteria into the gallery  space.
