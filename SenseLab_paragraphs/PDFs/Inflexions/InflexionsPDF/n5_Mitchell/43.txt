Thus,  even  if we  were  to accept  Simondonâ€™s  claim  that  a plant  variety bred  to
greenhouse conditions could  not  longer  survive in  the  geographic locale  from which   it  was  originally taken,   this  does  not  mean   that  this  plant   genome is unable to survive outside the  greenhouse; rather, it might  simply mean  that  its range  of possible milieu  has shifted or altered. Moreover, though Simondon sees the cultivation of a plant  species  within a greenhouse or laboratory as a restriction
