Both  Transgenic Bacteria Release Machine and  Disembodied Cuisine emphasize the extent  to which  bioart  is premised on an understanding of art guided neither by the classical goal of presenting instances of beauty, nor by the more recent  goal of the avant-garde, that  of engendering critical reflection. This is not to suggest that bioart  provides no  occasion  for  judgments  of beauty or  that  it hinders critical reflection: many  of the works  that  I cited  above,  in fact, aim at encouraging both judgments  of beauty and  critical  reflection. Nevertheless, such  judgments  and reflections emerge as secondary consequences of the experience of bioart,  which more    fundamentally   seeks    to   enable    in   gallery-goers   an   experience   of simultaneous activity  and  passivity – a becoming-medium – which  itself encourages an embodied sense  of becoming (perhaps unwilling) participants of larger,  dynamic systems, of which  neither we nor  the artists  are fully in control. This  insistence  of  bioart   on  the  importance  of  the  experience  of  becoming- medium in turn  requires us to rethink both the function of “media” in art and  the nature of art itself as a medium.
