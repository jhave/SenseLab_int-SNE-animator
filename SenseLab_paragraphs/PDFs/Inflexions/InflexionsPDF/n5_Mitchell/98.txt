In  articulating his  philosophy of art,  Simondon drew primarily on  traditional examples of art  objects,  such  as temples, sculpture, and  paintings, and  he was critical   of  more   recent   art   that   aimed  to   provide  representations  of  new technologies. [26] However, his approach to artworks as fundamentally forms  of mediation – that  is, not  so much  objects  as “key  points” at which  the  world is inserted into  the human and  the  human into  the world – provides a compelling way  of understanding the  affective  power of bioart  (and  this  is true  whether or not  one  accepts  his genetic  account of the  historical origin  of art).  It helps  us to explain, for example, the sense  of “thisness” that  is so distinctive to bioart  – the sense,    that    is,   that    in   being    situated   alongside  biotechnologically-altered organisms or tissue,  one is present at something that  is happening right  now,  in this  place.  [27] At  the  same  time,  Simondon’s  philosophy of art  also  helps  to explain the  sense  of  mutual imbrication of  world and  human that  is  equally distinctive of bioart.  By employing the gallery  air as both  a biological and  artistic medium, for example, works  such  as Disembodied Cuisine and  Transgenic Bacteria Release Machine emphasize those  areas  of the body  – for example, orifices such as the  nose  and  mouth – at  which  milieu  literally insert  themselves into  human beings,  while  at the  same  time  the  biotechnological aspects of the  works  (e.g., tissue  scaffolding and  genetic  manipulation) emphasize those  “sites”  at  which human activity  can  grab  hold  of elements of our  milieu.  By exploiting vague worries about  infection, these two bioartworks also make  us aware of the various networks of interpersonal relations, transportation, and  communication that  link spectators to one another and  to the wider world.
