Yet Simondon claims  that  at the  same  time  as technology and  religion split  the unity  of the  human/milieu  relationship that  obtained in the  magical  mode,  art also  emerged as  a  way   of  partially  recreating the  totality of  the  reticulated network of the  magical  mode.  Aesthetic thought,  Simondon contends, “is that which  maintains the function of totality” that  would otherwise be lost in the split between technology and  religion (2001: 179; my  translation). More  specifically, aesthetic thought  maintains  the  function of  totality by  “reconstituting  in  the interior  of  each   mode   of  thought  a  reticulation  which   coincides  with   the reticulation of other  modes of thought: the aesthetic tendency is the ecumenicism of thought” (Simondon 2001: 181, my  translation). [25] Art  objects  accomplish this  re-reticulation by  creating something like  those  privileged “key  points” of the   magical   mode:   that   is,  specific   times   and   places   at   which   a  mutual interchange between humans and  the world becomes  possible. In this sense,  the art  object  “is  not  properly speaking an  object,  but  an  extension of the  natural world or the human world which  remains inserted in the reality  which  it bears; it is a remarkable point  of the universe” (Simondon 2001: 187; my translation). The art  object  benefits  from  technology, but  unlike  a technical object,  the  art  object has  a certain  “thisness” that  cannot be transferred just anywhere; it “represents
