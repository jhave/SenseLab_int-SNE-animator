However,  because Transgenic  Bacteria Release Machine  does   not  in  fact  infect gallery-goers, it allows  these  latter  to  discover experientially, so  to  speak,  the different modes of media employed in biological research and  biotechnological development. In contemporary laboratory practice, the  term  “media” generally denotes either  a solid  such as agar,  which  provides nutrients for prokaryotic organisms such  as E. coli, or  fluids  such  as  dmem or  rpmi,  which  researchers employ to provide nutrients for eukaryotic cells (i.e., cells from  multicellular organisms). Biologists  use  media for  a number of different purposes:  nutritive media, for example, simply grow  and  sustain microorganisms or cells; selective media contain elements (e.g., specific antibiotics) that allow only particular microorganisms or cells to grow;  and  differential media facilitate  the  growth of multiple  kinds   of  microorganisms  but   contain  colored  elements  that   allow different kinds  of microorganisms to be visually distinguished from one another. Pressing the red  button of Transgenic Bacteria Release Machine is predicated on an implicit   emergent  awareness  of  these   media  differences –  a  recognition,  for example, that  though the  interior of the  human body  could  indeed serve  as  a nutritive medium for  the  E. coli, the  air  that  connects the  petri  dish  with  the spectator functions as  a  selective   medium which   allows  the  spectator to  live while  killing  the E. coli, and  thus  prevents the human body  from  performing the role of nutritive medium for these  specific instances of E. coli. Though Transgenic Bacteria Release Machine begins  as simply a part  of a spectator’s associated milieu, the  experience of  becoming-medium that  it  encourages enables   the  project  to become  a means  of extending the  gallery  goer’s  associated milieu  by  focusing affective  attention on the ways in which  multiple associated milieu  become  either linked to or distinguished from one another.
