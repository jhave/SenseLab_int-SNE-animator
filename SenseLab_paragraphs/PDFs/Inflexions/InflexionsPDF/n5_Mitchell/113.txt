[6]  It  is  worth  stressing  that   “individualization”  and   “individuation”  are different concepts for Simondon. The latter  generally refers  to large-scale transformations of an  entire  system which  result  in new  kind  of being  (that  is, new  from  the  perspective of the  system), while  “individualization” refers  to a more   limited  processes of  “evolution”  of  a  specific  kind   of  technical  being. However, as Simondon’s opening discussion of the construction of bricks in L’individuation  emphasizes, it is indeed possible to speak  of “individuation” in the case of technical objects, provided that  the focus is on the transformations of the  system that  makes  a technical object  possible – in the  case  of the  brick,  the system of clay and  mold  – rather than  on the evolution of forms  of the technical object (Simondon 1964 : 28-39).
