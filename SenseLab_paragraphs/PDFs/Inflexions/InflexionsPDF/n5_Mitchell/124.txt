[19] It is worth stressing that  the power of bioart  depends not simply on its deployment of biotechnological equipment and  living  tissue,  but  also on its hybridization  of   these   elements  with    two   artistic    traditions,  that   of   the readymade and   that  of  performance art.  The  former tradition  establishes for gallery-goers the plausibility that  we are indeed in the presence of real biological equipment originally intended for, and  used  within, a biological laboratory (but then  subsequently appropriated  by  the  artist  for  use  within the  space  of  the gallery),  while  the  latter  tradition enables  a confusion about  the  precise  borders of the work  of art and  encourages in us a sense that  both  the origin  and  future of this work  of art remain indeterminate and  open.  For a more  extended analysis of these two traditions in the context  of bioart,  see (Mitchell  2010a: 77ff).
