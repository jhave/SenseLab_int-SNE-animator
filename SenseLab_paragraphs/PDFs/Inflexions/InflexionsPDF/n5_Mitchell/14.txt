One  of  the  key  terms   in  Simondon’s  writings  on  technology  is  “associated milieu,” and  what  makes  this concept especially interesting is that  it merges the Lamarckian concept of milieu  (which  positions milieu  as condition of possibility of innovation) with  the Bernardian concept of milieu  (which  understands milieu in terms  of constancy and  stability). Insofar  as Simondon discusses technology in terms  of milieu,  he draws on the  parallel that  Bernard had  established between living  beings  and  machines. However, Simondon’s concept of associated milieu in fact goes  beyond the  basic homeostatic framework of Bernard’s approach by taking  up  explicitly, as had  Lamarck, the  question of the  ways  in which  milieu can lead  to transformation and  becoming. Moreover, as we will see, Simondon’s notion of  associated  milieu   allows   us  to  move   beyond  some   of  the  specific limitations that  Simondon himself  placed on the concept of technical objects, and in this way helps  us to understand the possibility of a biotechnology.
