The development of recombinant DNA techniques in the 1970s changed the landscape significantly, however, for  it became  not  only  possible to  think,  but also technically possible to manipulate, living  beings  as assemblages of functions that  could  be  coordinated with  one  another in  ways  that  were  new  and  non- natural, yet  not  necessarily  “artificial”  in  Simondon’s  sense   of  the  term.   By “cutting and  pasting” at the level of genetic  code, molecular biologists were  able in  principle to  isolate  a  particular phenotypic trait  in  one  living  being  – for example, the  capacity to  produce  bioluminescence or  resistance  to  a  specific herbicide  –  and   move   it  into  another  living   being.   [12]  This  represented  a fundamental shift  in  the  way  in  which  humans solicited desirable traits  from plants and  animals:  rather than  simply amplifying traits  already existent in  a given  species  of plant  or animal or altering developmental processes in the hope of producing useful  mutations, humans were  now  able to treat  traits  as technical functions that  in principle could  be moved from  one  species  (whether plant  or animal) to another.
