However, bioart  – a relatively new mode  of artistic  practice that integrates bioengineered  living   organisms  or   tissue   into   the   artwork  itself   –  shows considerable promise as a means  for thinking and  instantiating a Simondonian- inspired “bioethics” of  biotechnological objects.  Bioart,  I suggest, ought to  be understood as an attempt to facilitate  the development of “good” biotechnology
–  that   is,  biotechnology  oriented  toward  the   telos   of  establishing  greater coherence  of   functions  –   in   a   context    in   which    corporate   research   on biotechnology is largely  oriented toward artificial  modifications of living  beings (with  “artificial” taken  in Simondon’s sense  of the term).  Bioart seeks, moreover, to create  among its publics those  corporeal schemas that  will make  this  telos  of greater coherence visible,  and  in  this  way  lessen  the  hold  of the  master/slave schema that dominates current discussions of biotechnology.
