Yet  Bernard’s  emphasis on  the  ways   in  which   milieu   promote  stability and constancy also led  him  to compare living  beings  and  technical objects  in a way that  set  the  stage  for  Simondon’s  approach to  the  concept of  milieu.  Bernard suggested that  his distinction between internal and  cosmic milieu  was implicit  in the construction of modern machinery, for he argued that  it was  only  by means of something like an interior milieu  that  a modern machine could  be prevented from  malfunctioning. A steam  engine  for  example, depended upon an  interior space  relatively free of influence from  the  exterior milieu  in which  the  machine was situated: “climactic  changes [must]  have  no influence at all on the action of a steam   engine,   though  everyone knows that   exact  conditions of  temperature, pressure and  humidity inside  the  machine govern all its movements.” Bernard also located in the internal milieu  a criterion for distinguishing better  from worse machines: “the  perfection of the  machine consists  in being  more  and  more  free and  independent, so as to be less and  less subject  to the  influence of the  outer milieu” (1957: 98, translation modified).
