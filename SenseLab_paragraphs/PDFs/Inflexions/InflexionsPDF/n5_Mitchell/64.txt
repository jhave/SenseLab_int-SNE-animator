Simondon  was   acutely  attuned   to   this   kind    of   schizophrenic  emotional relationship with  technology, and  his philosophy of technical objects was in part an attempt to move  beyond simplistic master/slave schemata for understanding technology (”will  we master our  machines, or will they  master us”?).  Simondon argued that  the  industrialization of technology in  the  nineteenth century had meant  the  loss,  for  most   people,  of  “corporeal  schemas”  able  to  provide  a knowing  (rather  than    simply  reactionary)  relationship  to   technology.  He contended,  for  example,  that   though  many   of  the   tools   introduced  in  the eighteenth century had  encouraged a sense  of optimism and  freedom precisely because these  tools  expanded the  possibilities of existing  bodily  schemata for acting,  there  were  fewer  felt  links  between habitual bodily   schemata and  the industrial technologies of the  nineteenth and  twentieth centuries. [16] As a consequence, these latter  technologies often felt like hindrances to individual freedom, which  in turn  encouraged people to understand such  technologies in terms  of master/slave dynamics. Simondon hoped, by means  of his philosophy of technology, to encourage the  development of new  schemas adequate to  the technologies  of  the   twentieth  century.  A  similar   loss   –  or,   perhaps  more accurately, lack of development – of corporeal schemas also describes our contemporary relationship to biotechnology, and  this  lack is exacerbated by the consumerist frame  that guides discussion of this new mode  of technology.
