the magical  universe is already structured, but according to a mode anterior  to  the   segregation  of  the   object   and   the   subject;   this primitive mode  of structuration is that  which  distinguishes figure and   foundation  by   marking  key   points  in   the   universe  […] preceding   the    segregation   of   unities,   there    is   instituted   a reticulation of space  and  time  which  highlights privileged spaces and  moments, as  if  all  of  man’s  power of  acting  and  all  of  the capacity of the  world to influence man  was  concentrated in these spots  and  these  moments. These  places  and  moments hold, concentrate, and  express the  forces  contained in the  foundation of reality  that  they  support. These  points and  these  moments are not separated realities, but they  localize  and  focalize  the attitude of the living vis-à-vis  his milieu  (Simondon 2001: 164; my translation).
