Despite the problems with  Simondon’s particular factual  claims that I have noted above,   what    likely   motivated  this   passage  was   his   sense   that   engineers approached  technical objects  from  a quite  different perspective than  that  which guided horticulturalists, at least  at the  time  that  he wrote.  [11] Where  engineers understood a technical object as an assemblage of functions that  ought to be coordinated with  one another, horticulturalists understood plants as unified organisms that  could   nevertheless be  made   to  produce certain   outputs (e.g., double-petaled flowers).   This  latter  approach, which  was  oriented not  by  the implicit  goal of producing greater coherence but rather that  of producing specific products,  could   only   (or  was   at  least   more   likely)   to  achieve   its  ends   by destroying existing  systems of coherence (e.g., one could  produce double-petaled flowers  only at the cost of destroying the plant’s quasi-autonomous reproductive capacities).  Yet  if  such   was   indeed  the  premise  that   motivated  Simondon’s claims,  it  leaves  unthought the  possibility that  a  living  being  itself  might   be approached as  an  assemblage of  functions that  can  be  coordinated with  one another not simply in the ways  in which  “nature” has coordinated them,  but also in accordance with  human desires.
