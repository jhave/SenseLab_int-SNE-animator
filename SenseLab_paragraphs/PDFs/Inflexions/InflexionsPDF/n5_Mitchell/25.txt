We see Simondon here  again  drawing on Bernardâ€™s notion of the  singularity of milieu:  just as for Bernard each living being  establishes its own  internal milieu  in order to  protect itself  from  the  cosmic  milieu,   for  Simondon  some  technical objects  also  have  their  own  associated milieu  which  draw selectively from  the natural elements around them.
