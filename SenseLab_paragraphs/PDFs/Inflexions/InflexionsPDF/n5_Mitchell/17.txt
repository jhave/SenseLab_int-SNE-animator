The associated milieu  of a living  being  is often  made  up  in part  of other  living beings,  for living  beings  “require, as an associated milieu,  strata  of more  finished and  stable individuals. In order to live, living  beings  need  physico-chemical individuals; animals need  plants, which  are, for them,  Nature in the  strict  sense of the  word, as chemical  compounds are  for plants” (Simondon 1964:  133; my translation).
