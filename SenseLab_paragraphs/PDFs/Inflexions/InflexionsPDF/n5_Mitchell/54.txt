The  status of associated milieu  in biotechnology is arguably more  complicated than    in   the   case   of   non-living   technical  objects,   for   once   a   particular biotechnology is “assembled,” further instances of that  same  biotechnology do not  themselves  have   to  assembled,  but  rather can  be  grown from  that   first instance. So, for example, in order to develop its Roundup Ready  soy beans  – a variety of soy bean  genetically modified to withstand heavy  doses  of Roundup herbicide – the  Monsanto Company originally had  to insert  bacterial DNA  into soy bean  germplasm. However, in principle this process of assembly only needs to occur  once, for future generations of Roundup Ready  soy beans  can be grown from  the first generation. As this example suggests, the associated milieu  of biotechnology can appear at three  different “sites”:  (i) in the process of assembly (a process in  which  the  cellular  and  chemical  processes of an  existing  variety of living  being  are exploited to introduce new  material into this same  living  being); (ii) during the  growth process of this  new  variety of living  being  (for  example, spraying fields  with  heavy  does  of Roundup herbicide will kill all plants except those  containing Roundup-resistant  DNA,  allowing these  latter  to  thrive);  (iii)
