An individual is not only composed of a collection  of organs interconnected to form a system. [The living organism] is also composed of  that  which   is  neither organ   nor  structure of  living matter  inasmuch  as  it  constitutes  an  associated  milieu   for  the organs. Living  matter is the ground for the organs. It is what  links them  together to make  them  an organism. It is what  maintains the basic  thermal  and   chemical   equilibrium with   which   the  organs produce sudden but limited variations (Simondon 2001: 60 [Mellamphy 60]; Brouwer and  Mulder 2007: 3-4).
