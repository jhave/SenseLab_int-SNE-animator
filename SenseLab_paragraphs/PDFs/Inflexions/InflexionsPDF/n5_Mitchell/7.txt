how  Simondon employed the  concept of associated milieu  in both  his  writings on individuation and  in Du mode, and  I argue that  these  discussions indeed open up the possibility of understanding contemporary biotechnology as a technology, in the  Simondonian sense  of the  term.  I then  consider biotechnology from  the perspective of one  of Simondon’s  other  great  concerns – namely, the  ways  in which   humans  relate   affectively  to  technical  objects  –  and   use  Simondon’s concept of the associated milieu  to discuss two recent  bioartworks. By employing living  matter as a technical object  within the  frame  of art,  bioart  seeks  to focus attention on the mediations – in both  the communicational and  biological senses of  the   term   –  that   attend  all  technical  individuation,   but   are   particularly pronounced in biotechnology. In doing so, bioart  helps  us to establish “corporeal schemas” that  allow  us to engage biotechnology beyond the dichotomy of mastery/slavery, and  thus  forms part  of what  Jean-Hughes Barthémély describes as a new  genetic  encyclopedism (Barthélémy 2008). Reading bioart  and biotechnology through Simondon’s philosophy of technological objects  and Simondon’s  philosophy  of  technological  objects   through  the   history  of  the concept of  milieu   emphasizes that  if  both  the  history of  technology and   the philosophy of technology move  forward, they  do  so not  in  linear  fashion, but rather as a consequence of perpetually eccentric  movements able  to forge  new connections with  apparently past forms of individuation and  thought.
