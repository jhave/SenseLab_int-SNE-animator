Nineteenth-century physician and  experimentalist Claude Bernard deepened the connection between milieu  and  living  beings  by expanding the “sites”  of milieu. Rather  than  restricting milieu  to the  outside of the  animal, Bernard argued that warm-blooded animals also create  internal milieu  within their  own  bodies  in the form  of flows of blood  and  other  bodily  fluids.  Internal milieu  protect the living body  by remaining relatively constant in temperature, humidity, and  pressure, thus  isolating the fragile  organs inside  the organism from  the harsh and  variable “cosmic  milieu” within which  organisms collectively exist (Bernard 1957: 97, translation modified). Where  Lamarck used  the  term  milieu  to denote flows  of gases and  fluids  common to many  animals, Bernard’s internal milieu  are specific to each species  and  arguably even to each animal. And  where milieu  for Lamarck functioned  as  the   condition  of  possibility  for  organic  innovation  –  for  the emergence of new forms  of life – for Bernard, the interior milieu  maintains life as it currently exists.
