Where  technology abstracts from  and  individualizes what  were  “key  points” in the magical  mode,  religion, by contrast, universalizes the “foundation” of reality, creating a sense  of foundation that  is not  specific  to certain  sites and  time  (as in the magical  relation to the world), but is rather always in excess of any particular point  or time (Simondon 2001: 172-3).
