While corporate bioengineers have largely  focused their  attention on the first two sites  of  associated  milieu   noted above   –  processes  of  assembly  and   growth processes – activists  opposed to many  forms  of bioengineering have  emphasized the ways in which  associated milieu  can emerge over the course  of multiple generations. Guiding this  critique is  the  recognition that  the  primary danger posed  by  genetic   modification  is  not  that   of  enervation,  but   rather  that   of excessive  vitality. Consider again  the  example of Monsanto’s  Roundup Ready soy bean.  Simondon would likely have  been more  comfortable in describing as a concrete technical object  the  air-cooled engine  of the  tractor that  harvests this crop rather than  the plants themselves. Yet even as the Roundup Ready  soy plant depends, like all plants, upon the associated milieu  of the farmland, the potential of Roundup Ready  soy  plants emerges only  by means  of the  introduction of a new  element into  the  associated milieu,  namely, Roundup  herbicide, which  – when sprayed on the  fields  – kills other  plants but  does  not  affect the  soy. This crop  does  not  suffer  from  the  problem of enervation that  Simondon linked to greenhouse and  laboratory alterations of plant  life, for Monsanto crops  can keep reproducing on their  own,  and this is a “problem” both from Monsanto’s point  of view   and   for   a   public   suspicious  of   genetically-modified  organisms.  For Monsanto, the  problem is that  Roundup Ready  crops  produce viable  seed  that can be stored by farmers, whereas Monsanto would prefer  that  farmers buy seed from  the  company every  year.  Monsanto has  thus  had  to make  recourse to the law  to ensure that  its “intellectual property” is not  “pirated” by farmers in the form  of seed  storage (or, to put  this  another way,  Monsanto has  had  to ensure that  these  plants are  understood as  technical objects  before  the  law).  [14] For critics  of genetically-modified organisms, though, the  problem with  Monsanto crops  is that  the company seeks  to encourage a monoculture – that  is, it seeks to have  all  farmers buy  genetically-identical seed  from  Monsanto. The  danger of monoculture is not that  the vitality of the crop will wither away  from within, but rather that  monocultures  encourage crop  pests,   such  as  insects,   viruses, and
