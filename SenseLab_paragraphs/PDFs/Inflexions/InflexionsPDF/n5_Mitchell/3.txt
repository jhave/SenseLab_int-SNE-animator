After a half-century of neglect  in the English-speaking world, Gilbert  Simondon’s philosophy  of  technology  seems   finally   poised  to  make   its  way   across   the Atlantic.  Spurred  in  part   by  Gilles  Deleuze’s,  Félix  Guattari’s,  and   Bernard Stiegler’s engagement with  Simondon’s oeuvre, and  in part  by translations of Simondon’s work  that  have  recently become  available (albeit largely  still only on the   internet),   a   growing  number   of   contemporary   scholars  have    found themselves attracted by  Simondon’s  distinctive approach to  technology, which joins  a  minute  attention to  technical  detail   to  a  philosophical approach  that draws its language and  concepts from  sources as varied as Gestalt  psychology, cybernetics, neo-Bergsonian vitalism, and  modern physics. Though the technical objects  that  Simondon himself  analyzed and  theorized were  largely  industrial- era   objects,   such   as   turbines,  automobile  motors,  cathode-ray  tubes,   and electronic  components,  his  work   has   been   of  particular  interest  to  scholars interested in  communication media and  the  social  logic  of  networks, and  his concept of “individuation” has  emerged as a way  of theorizing more  carefully and   fully  those  social  and   technical transformations  that  otherwise are  often lumped under the wooly  rubric  of “emergence.” [1]
