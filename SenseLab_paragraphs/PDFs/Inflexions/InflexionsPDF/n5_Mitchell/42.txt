Fig.  1 The  image at  the  bottom represents seven individual instances of the  herb  Achillea, each growing at  the  same  low  altitude and each  with a different genotype. Two  cuttings were taken from  each  plant. One  cutting was  planted at a medium altitude, and the  other at a high  altitude. Though the  three plants in  each  of  the  seven “columns” are  clones   of  one  another, each  has grown quite differently, depending  on  the  altitude. Moreover, there is  no  one  genotype that grows “best” at  all  altitudes. Source:   Jens  Clausen, David  D.  Keck,  and  William H.
