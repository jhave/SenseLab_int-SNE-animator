Simondon employed the  term  associated milieu  in his 1958 dissertation, part  of which  was  later  published as L’individuation  à la lumière des notions de forme et d’information (Individuation in the Light of the Notion of Form  and  Information) (1964), using  it there  as a way  of describing the kind  of individuation specific to living beings.  [5] In L’individuation, Simondon stressed that a “milieu” should not be understood as something already given,  but rather as that  complement of the individual  that  is  brought into  being  by  processes  of  individuation: “individuation  brings   into   being   not   only   the   individual,  but   the   couple individual-milieu” (Simondon 1964: 4; my  translation). For Simondon, a milieu does not pre-exist the individual to which  it is the complement; rather, a milieu  is “a synthetic grouping of two  or more  levels  of reality  that  lack communication before  [the  event  of] individuation”  (Simondon 1964: 13, n. 1; my  translation). Simondon  sometimes  seems   to  use  the  term   associated milieu   to  distinguish between those  milieu  that  emerge as the complements of non-living individuals (e.g.,  a  crystal)   and   those   milieu   that   emerge  as  the  complement  of  living individuals  (e.g.,  a  plant).   In  the   latter   case,   the   system  that   enabled  the emergence of an individual persists in the living individual itself:
