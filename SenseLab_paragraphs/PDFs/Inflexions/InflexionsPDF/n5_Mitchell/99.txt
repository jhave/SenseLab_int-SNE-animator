Finally,  bioart  emphasizes in particularly explicit  fashion Simondon’s claim that art  is fundamentally a mode  of mediation between different forms  of thought and   practice (or,  as  Simondon puts   it,  art  is  “the  ecumenicism of  thought”). Bioart depends upon artists’ ability  to move  biotechnological processes, such  as cloning,  the introduction of genetic  material from  one  organism to another, and tissue   scaffolding, from  the  biological laboratory  into  the  art  gallery,   and   to attach  these  processes to a-scientific  considerations (for example, questions of identity;  the  ethics  of  “cuisine”; etc.).  As  I have  noted above,  this  activity   of mediation is not  principally a form  of reflection on the  problematic of biotechnology, but  rather a means  for  transforming the  problematic of biotechnology from  within. Rather  than  simply producing an  ambient sense  of worry about  the infectious character of life, for example, bioart  instead engenders corporeal schemata that  link  specific  biotechnologies, such  as tissue  scaffolding and  genetic  manipulation, with  more  global,  “ecological” patterns  of  change. Thus,  rather than   forcing   us  to  decide “for”  or  “against”  biotechnology –  a decision that  is ultimately a form of hygienic abstraction rather than  engagement
– bioartworks seek  to produce new  forms  of linkage within the  problematic of biotechnology. Yet bioart  can  produce such  changes only  when it maintains its status  as  mediator between  science   and   non-scientific nodes  of  thought  and practice (rather than,  for example, seeking to become  directly “ethical”).
