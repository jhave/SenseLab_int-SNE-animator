Simondon’s   second  claim,   that   plants  bred   for   “artificial”  milieu   such   as laboratories or  greenhouses will  become   so  enervated that  they  cannot exist outside these  artificial  milieu,  is equally problematic, for it suggests an implicit assumption about  “harmony” between living  beings  and  milieu  that  is not  only factually dubious but  also  in tension with  Simondon’s  claims  in L’individuation and  claims  he makes  elsewhere in Du mode. Even at the time that  Simondon was writing, it was  clear to many  botanists that  a given  plant  genotype could  in fact survive in a number of different milieu,  though the  phenotype would differ  in each  case,  and  that  as a consequence it was  difficult  to identify either  a “best” genotype or a “best”  milieu  for a given  species.  This fact has been popularized in the  last  several   decades by  molecular biologists such  as  Richard Lewontin in texts  such  as  The Triple Helix  (2000) (which  includes Fig.  1), but  as  Lewontin notes,  this fact had  been known to botanists since in the late 1940s (Lewontin 200:
20-21).
