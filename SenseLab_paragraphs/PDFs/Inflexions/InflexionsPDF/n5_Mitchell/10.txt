Lamarck took up this sense  of milieu  as element of transmission, but “vitalized” the term  in an important way. Though Lamarack used  milieu  to denote elements such  as  water and  gases,  he  was  less  interested in  the  ways  in  which  milieu transmit something – for example, sound or light  – than  in the  effects of milieu on living  beings.  Noting that  the  milieu  within which  living  beings  exist slowly change over  time  – the  salinity of a sea, for example, may  increase or decrease over  time  – Lamarck argued that  animals seek  to “stick”  to their  milieu  even  as they   (the   milieu)   alter,   and   this   effort   to   remain  within  changing  milieu engendered new  habits  and  needs  on  the  part  of the  animal. These  new  habits and  needs  in turn  altered the body  of the animal, and  these organic changes were passed on to progeny. The result,  over  long  periods of time,  was  the emergence of  new   “species.”  [4]  For  Lamarck,  milieus  were   not  simply  a  medium  of transmission  for   physical  phenomena   but,   in   addition,  the   condition  of possibility of organic innovation;  it is because milieus perpetually  change that there   is  constant organic variation  amongst  the  living.  A  milieu   is  thus   not simply that  which  sustains life but  also  that  which  makes  possible (and  in fact inevitable)  perpetual  organic  change  –  what   Simondon  would  call “individuation” – amongst the living.
