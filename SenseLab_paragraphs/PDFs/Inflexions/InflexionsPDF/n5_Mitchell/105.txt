in his discussion of art is unnecessarily restrictive. Simondon seems to have understood the  experience of art  primarily, and  perhaps exclusively, as one  of beauty: “[t]here is a beauty of things and  of beings,” Simondon contended, “and aesthetic activity   begins   by  sensing and   organizing this  when it  is  naturally produced” (2001: 183; my translation). Yet this Enlightenment-style restriction of the  effect  of  art  to  pacific,  equanimious judgments  of  beauty does  not  seem entirely consonant with  Simondon’s account of the  way  in which  art recalls  the magical  relation to  the  world by  recreating a reticulated world of key-points. Bioart  thus  emphasizes what  Simondon’s  account of art  implies, but  does  not make  entirely clear: namely, that the experience of this re-reticulated world is not best  described in  terms  of  judgments  (of,  for  example, beauty), but  rather in terms  of affective  connections forged between areas  of thought and  practice that would otherwise remain separated.
