commodities:  should genetically modified (GM) vegetables be labeled as such, and  are they as safe as non-GM  vegetables? Can I discourage genetic  engineering by buying local, “green” produce? Will my  insurance pay  for this  reproductive testing or selection service,  or will this biotechnology be restricted to those  who are well-off? [15] Yet even as it emphasizes the world-changing potential of bioengineering,  this   consumerist  frame   restricts  agency   to   a   very   narrow bandwidth – the  binary choice  “buy/not-buy”  – which  in  turn  encourages an oscillation between feelings  of mastery (“I can change the world through my consumer choices!”) and  feelings  of powerlessness (“my consumer choices ultimately make no difference”), on the other.
