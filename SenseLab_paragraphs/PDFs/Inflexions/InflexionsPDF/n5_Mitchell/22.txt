A similar  emphasis on stability also seems to be at work  in Simondon’s use of the term  “associated milieu” to describe the “individualization” of technical objects. [6] Simondon describes the individualization of a technical object – for example, an engine  – as a process of becoming more  or more  “concrete,” which  means,  in essence,  that  its component parts  become  more  and  more  multi-functional (or, as Simondon puts,  “plurifunctional”) (Simondon 2001: 54 [Mellamphy 57]). Thus, Simondon contends that  an  air-cooled engine   is  more  concrete than  a  water- cooled  engine,  because in the  latter,  water performs only  one  function (that  of cooling),  while  in the  air-cooled engine,  the air performs multiple functions (for example, both  cooling   and   producing the  compression  necessary to  generate thrust). This individualization of the technical object is only  possible, Simondon claims, when the technical object can establish a
