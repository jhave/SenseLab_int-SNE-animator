At  the  same  time,  biotechnology itself  provides an  opportunity for  deepening some  of the key concepts of Simondon’s philosophy of technology. The different ways   in  which   biotechnologies integrate  and   employ  associated  milieu,   for example, suggests that we need  better  descriptions of the various topological and temporal structures that  associated milieu  may take. As Simondon himself  notes, the  associated milieu  is both  “inside” and  “outside” the  technical object: it is “a definite system of  natural elements surrounding  the  technical object  and  it is linked to  a  definite system of  elements which  constitute the  technical object” (2001:    57  [Mellamphy  61]).  Yet  the   specific   folds   by  means   of  which   an associated milieu  relates  inside  to outside can differ  significantly from  technical object  to technical object  and  from  one  “species” of technical object  to another, and  this in turn  requires different languages of description. Where  the associated milieu  that  Simondon himself  studied, for example, could  be described topologically  through   concepts  drawn   from    physics   (thermal   exchanges; electrical  thresholds; etc.), the associated milieu  of biotechnology require another language, that of molecular biology,  which  draws on a different set of topological concepts (e.g., (biological) vectors,  gene expression, gene switches, etc.). Biotechnologies emphasize,  moreover,  the  temporality of  associated milieu— and,  by extension, the issue  of “sustainability” – in a way that  is either  absent  or at most implicit  in Simondon’s accounts of turbines, dams,  and automobiles.
