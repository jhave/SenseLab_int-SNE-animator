The  study  of  the   systems  of  functioning  in  concrete  technical objects   is  valuable  scientifically  because  these   objects   are   not derived from  a single  principle. They  are the evidence of a certain mode  of functioning and  of compatibility that exists in fact and  that was   constructed  before   being    foreseen.  The   compatibility  in question  was   not   contained  in   each   of   the   distant  scientific principles which  played their  part  in the construction of the object; it was empirically discovered (Simondon 2001: 48 [Mellamphy 46]).
