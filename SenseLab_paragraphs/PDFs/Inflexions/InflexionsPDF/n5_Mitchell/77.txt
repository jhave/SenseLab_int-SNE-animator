with   resources  for   understanding  –  and   potentially  altering  –  his   or   her relationship   to    the    problematic   of    biotechnology.   Rather    than    simply encouraging abstract reflection on that  problematic as though it were  happening “elsewhere,” Transgenic Bacteria Release Machine allows  for an experience of being an  element within  the  problematic of biotechnology. To be  situated within the problematic of biotechnology is indeed, as some  commentators critical  of bioart have  recognized, to be a medium for (rather than  simply a reflection on) biotechnology. [20] Yet as  Transgenic Bacteria Release Machine emphasizes, a medium always involves both  a capacity for-being-affected and  a capacity-for- affecting,  and  there  are thus  many  ways  of being  a medium. The mediality of the gallery-goer is produced through a linkage of situated thoughts (“Is E. coli dangerous?”)  and   embodied  decisions  (“I’ll   press   the   button”),  as  well   as dimensions of  embodiment that  are  not  under the  control   of  the  gallery-goer (e.g., one’s corporeal “openness” to microbial forms of life and  one’s dependency on  the  decisions of others  to  press  or  not  press  the  button). Thus,  though the gallery-goer may indeed become  a medium for biotechnology, this is likely not to be simply a “nutritive” medium for biotechnology in the  abstract, but  rather a selective   or  differential medium that  identifies and  selects  for  some  kinds   of biotechnology  over  others.   Transgenic Bacteria Release Machine,  in  short,   helps gallery-goers to  develop a form  of engagement with  biotechnology that  is not simply a reaction to a state  of affairs  that  is understood as occurring elsewhere, but is rather a form  of affective  intensity predicated on being  an element of, and a medium for, a state of affairs.
