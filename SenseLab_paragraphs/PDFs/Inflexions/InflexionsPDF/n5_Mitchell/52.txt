Not  surprisingly, concrete applications of these  techniques in fact have  proven far more  limited than  some early promoters of the biotechnology suggested. This is partly due  to overly  deterministic understandings of the relationships between genes  and  traits  which  until  recently guided attempts to “engineer” biology. Bioengineers have  also struggled in their  efforts  to alter  extraordinarily complex systems  of  self-regulation,  for  the  addition of  a  desired  trait   to  an  existing organism  often   has   unanticipated,  undesirable  effects   on   other   traits   (e.g., changing a gene  in order to slow  the speed at which  tomatoes become  soft may
