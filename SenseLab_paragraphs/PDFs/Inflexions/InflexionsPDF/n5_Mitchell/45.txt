The   dubious  nature  of   Simondon’s   first   two   claims   (about    the   loss   of reproductive capacity and  the enervating effects of artificial  milieu)  does  not necessarily invalidate the conclusion that  he appears to draw from  these  claims, namely, that  certain  modes of human intervention in the reproductive processes of non-human living beings  produce results that are the opposite of theose  which we  can  observe in technical evolution. However, this  “conclusion” does  not  so much  follow  from  the  first  two  claims  that  Simondon makes  in the  paragraph, but rather draws attention to what  appears to be an unstated premise that guides the  entire  passage:  namely, the  premise that  biological and  technical systems differ  absolutely in  terms  of complexity. Simondon implies that  the  “coherent system of biological functions” that  makes  up  a living  being  is so complex, at least by human standards, which  human interventions in reproductive processes tend   to  break   this  coherence, rather  than   producing an  even  more   coherent system. He sees technical objects, by contrast, as sufficiently simple  that modifications in their  structure can produce “evolution” (that  is, greater coherence). However, it is not  clear  from  this  passage whether Simondon was pointing to what  he saw as a tendency – that  is, human interventions in biological
