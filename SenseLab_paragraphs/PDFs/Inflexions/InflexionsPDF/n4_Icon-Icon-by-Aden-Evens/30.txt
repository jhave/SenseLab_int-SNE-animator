The gain  of a modeless interface is a perceived efficiency  for the user:  no longer does  she have  to execute  commands just to get ready for the next task.   The administrative labor  of  computer use  is  reduced, with  a  savings primarily in terms  of time.   A mode  functions as a temporal context;  at a given  moment, the computer is prepared for one  kind  of task  or for another, and  switching modes takes  some  time.   Instituting a kind  of modelessness, the  GUI trades space  for time,  laying  out the options on a plane  (or on a sheaf  of overlaid planes).6   Now instead of switching modes, the user clicks on an already visible icon or window and  immediately begins  working at  her  new  task.  She need  not  terminate her current operation before  switching to another.  In the GUI, (what  were  formerly) modalities are now  represented by different icons or different planes or different windows, spatial arrays that  reduce the amount of time  spent  switching modes. (Modes  have  been  much  reduced but  have  not  entirely disappeared from  the modern GUI; windows such as alert messages and  administrative password authorizations require action before any other  task can be resumed.)
