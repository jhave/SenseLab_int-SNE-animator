This analysis of the icon can likely be generalized to describe the whole  interface. The visual  interface follows  the logic of the icon throughout.  Not  just the small images  that  stand for  files  and  folders,  not  just  the  pictograms that  populate palettes and  toolbars, but every  element of the visual  interface, from menu items to scroll bars to characters of text, all adhere to an iconic logic.  Each object in the interface stands as  representative of  some  non-presentable version of  itself,  a binary encoding whose  visual  presentation is only  one  face, one  aspect.    What one  sees  on  the  computer screen  is in  principle generic,  iconic,  representing a digital artifact  that  is both  more  and  less than  its material analog.   It exceeds  its material analog  in that  it includes possibility as part  of its way  of being,  a set of possibilities for how it might  otherwise be.  But it falls short  of its material analog in that  it lacks the generative specificity of the material, the creative renewal that is the unique ontological mode  of the material world.
