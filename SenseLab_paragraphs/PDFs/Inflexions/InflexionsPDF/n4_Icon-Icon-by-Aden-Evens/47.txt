The   zero-width  selection  may   seem   like   an   odd   contortion,  a  kludge,  as programmers would say,  but  it mirrors the  essence  of the  digitalâ€™s  underlying ontological  modality.     The   digital  depends  fundamentally  on   a  difference between 0  and   1  but  a  difference without  content.   In  the  binary code,  the difference between 0 and  1 is purely formal,  which  is to say, modeless.  Every bit is what  value  it is, 0 or 1, but  the  substance of its value  is precisely that  of not being  its other.   The bit, as digital operator, has an unusual ontological status:  it is that  it might  have  been its other.  Might have been is in this case substantive, not an idle  counterfactual.  A 0 asserts  nothing more  than  not-1  and  so also asserts could-be-1.  Whatever sense a 1-bit makes,  it does  so because it could  be 0.  Thus the  zero-width  selection, which  also  operates by  virtue of what  it might  be or could  be, typifies  digitality, reproducing the fundamental dynamics of the binary at a higher level  of interactivity: the  ontological mode  of the  digital is precisely the might  be, pure  possibility rendered materially effective in the technology.
