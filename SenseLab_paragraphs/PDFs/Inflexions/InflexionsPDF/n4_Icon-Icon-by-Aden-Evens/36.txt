Kay effected  a similar  deterritorialization on Engelbartâ€™s other  major contribution to the GUI, the window.  Confronted with  the problem of limited monitor space, Kay   recognized  that   windows,  already  understood  as  independent  virtual spaces,  could  be stacked in overlapping planes, with  the front-most window remaining  visible   and   hiding  those   behind  it.    The  now   conventional  GUI element of stacked windows met  with  resistance when first  suggested, as some Xerox   PARC   researchers  believed  that   users   would  be   too   confused  by obstructed or partially obstructed information.  This objection  may  have  seemed more  pressing because visible  borders were  then  only  just  being  introduced to windowing systems, so the visual  clarity  of frames  around windows could  not be taken  as given.   In any case, what  now  seems  commonplace was then  a stroke  of genius, the  virtual third dimension in which  windows are  stacked.  (Note  that this is not the virtual third dimension of Albertian perspective; the planar area of a window does  not  shrink as  it recedes into  the  virtual depth of the  monitor screen.   There  is no vanishing point,  hence  no simulated visual  or spatial depth. Rather   the  plane   containing each  window is  infinitely thin,  and   they  are  all stacked within a single  infinitely thin  plane.    They  cover  each  other  but  they never  stack up to a thickness in depth.  The shadows and  other  edge  effects that decorate windows in modern operating systems are thus  unmotivated and  even incorrect according to the visual  logic of window depth.)
