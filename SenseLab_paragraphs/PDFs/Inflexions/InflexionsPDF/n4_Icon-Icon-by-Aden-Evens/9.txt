Of his own  considerable contribution to the invention of the GUI, computer researcher and interface guru Alan Kay dedicates much  to the young people who were  his  test  subjects  and  “primary motivation” for  much  of  the  research he conducted in  partnership with  Adele  Goldberg at  Xerox  PARC  in  the  1970s (1993: 79).  Kay held  that  the  computer offers  extraordinary creative possibility, but  he lamented that  that  possibility is out  of reach  for those  lacking  extensive technical expertise.    Hoping  to  lower   this  barrier,  Kay’s  team   designed an interface simple  enough for a child  to operate, with  a screen  full of pictograms, symbols that  resemble (at least  somewhat) what  they  represent, and  an intuitive pointing device  for input that  relies  on an embodied sense  of space  acquired in early  childhood.   To  generalize and  popularize this  interface, Kay  helped to invent the  programming  language Smalltalk, including a  visual   environment wherein one  writes   a  program by  arranging icons  within a  window.   Even children can use such  a system to tap into the computer’s potent possibility: Kay provides examples from  toddlers through high  school  students (1986).  Manifest in the  immediacy of recognizable, iconic  images,  the  computer reveals  its inner logic  to anyone with  eyes  to see and  so becomes  wholly available to a general audience.
