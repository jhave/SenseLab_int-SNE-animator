The  shift  to a modeless interface corresponds to a need  to make  the  computer more   available  to  the  user,   more   prepared  to  accommodate  the  contingent, arbitrary,  or   unpredictable  nature  of  human  needs   and   desires.    Personal computing calls for modelessness, as a personâ€™s attention is, generally speaking, modeless, ready to switch  focus with  little preparation or provocation. Working within the fixed linearity of a computer chip does  not come easily  to most  of us. The  modeless interface offers  a way  of interweaving or  enfolding human and computer temporalities.  We might  even  claim  that  not  just time  but  space  gets enfolded, as the  linear  zero-to-one dimensional computer process gets  arrayed on   the   flat   screen    to   provide  a   convincing  simulacrum   of   two-to-three dimensional availability.7
