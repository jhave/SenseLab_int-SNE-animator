Designing an interface that  functions in accord  with  the  cognitive style  of non- expert   human beings   presented  a  new   set  of  challenges.    Experts   could   be counted on to follow a set of procedures, not just a precise  syntax  but an order of operations corresponding to the  computer’s  own  linear  ordering of tasks.   The two-dimensional spread of icons,  menus, and  windows invited a less linear interaction, with  diverse possible actions  visually available all at once.   The GUI was designed to encourage experimentation, clicking  around just to see what happens.   To accommodate this loosened ordering of operations, the GUI emphasized modelessness; a  modal  interface, that  is,  an  interface with  modes, necessitates multiple steps  to complete a particular operation.  Many  operations require  that   the  computer first  be  switched into  the  proper mode,   and   this typically involves exiting  the  current mode  in which  the  computer is operating. “This  is what  modeless came  to mean  for me—the  user  could  always get  to the next  thing   desired without  any  backing  out”   (Kay,  2001:  129).    In  a  modal interface, each  application might  institute its own  mode,  such  that  switching to another application means  first terminating or suspending the current one.
