generally get interrupted, that  its task is intended to proceed from  start  to finish without extra-digital guidance. This structure understands the computer as task- oriented, designed to complete a series of tasks  it has been assigned.  It works  on computer  time,   on  clock  time,   as  clock  cycles  are  considered  expensive or valuable and  so must  be used  efficiently,  getting the most computing done  in the least amount of time and  resources.  A modal interface works  well in this case, as the  moments when  the  interface  is  available  to  the  computer  operator  are relatively anomalous and separated from the actual  calculations of the program.
