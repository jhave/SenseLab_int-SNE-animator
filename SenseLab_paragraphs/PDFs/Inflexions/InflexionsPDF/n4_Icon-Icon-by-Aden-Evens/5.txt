understand the machine well enough to operate on it more  directly.  Rather,  the interface  serves   the  essential  role  of  negotiating  an  irreconcilable  difference between  two   domains,  the  human and   the  digital.   Human  beings   are  not calculators, do  not  read  or  think  or  express themselves in  a  binary code  and cannot  practically  do  so.    The  user   interface  accommodates  the  differences between these  two  worlds but  in so doing it necessarily misrepresents them  to each other.   Any choice of interface involves a particular set of limitations on the possibilities for  expression in that  interface, pointing users  down certain  paths while  cutting off access  to other  possibilities.  Similarly,  every  interface distorts the digital domain it is supposed to present, erecting phantasmic objects and coherent operations where there  are in the machine only sequences of 0s and  1s. Examining  the   Graphical  User  Interface  (GUI),   now   pervasive  on   personal computing  devices,   this   essay   shows   the   design  choices   that   constitute  the interface and  articulates the consequences of those  choices.   The interface is that edge  where the digital meets  the human, but the two sides  are inevitably altered in this juncture.
