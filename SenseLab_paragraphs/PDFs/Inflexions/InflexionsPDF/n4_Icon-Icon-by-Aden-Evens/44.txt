The notion of a zero-width selection provides an archetype of virtualization. In order to connect  the  digital and  human domains, the  interface posits  a strange non-entity, a purely digital or virtual object, a selection that  consists  of nothing. It is the introduction of this contrivance, this digital thing  that  corresponds to no actual   or   human  thing,   that   makes   possible  the   most   natural  or   human interaction with  the text editor. From the perspective of the digital, a selection of zero characters is just as valid  as a selection of one or twenty-one characters. The same  rules  apply, the  same  operations can  be conducted, the  same  algorithms, the same code can manipulate this virtual object.10
