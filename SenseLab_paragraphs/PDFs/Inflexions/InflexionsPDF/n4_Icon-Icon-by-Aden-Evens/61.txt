Take  as an example the  computer game.   Computer games  frequently simulate three-dimensional spaces,  and  their  on-screen presentations  are  dynamic and supple, which  would seem  to contrast with  iconic logic.  Nevertheless, just as an icon  does,  each  item  in  a  game  appears in  a  certain   way  that  represents its generic  state  and  its  available possibilities.   The  player reads  the  possibilities from  the  representation and  adjusts  her  algorithm  accordingly.   Not  just  the images  but  the  habits,  the  twitches, the  tics,  the  slogans, the  patterns.   In  the game  persona of a hard-boiled but good-hearted rogue  hero,  you’re crossing the street,  on your  way  to eliminate an evil terrorist boss.   Suddenly a siren  sounds followed right  away  by a voiceover cop calling  over  the  radio,  “We’ve got him, boys.   Close  in.”   Then  you  hear  shots  fired,  ricochet, maybe  the  music  changes pace.   The first  time  you  experience this  sequence, you’re  so busy  figuring out what  to do, which  buttons to push, how  to escape,  that  you  do not  really  notice
