Unspecified possibility, or possibility per  se, derives from  the  central  power of the   digital;    the   digitalâ€™s   decisive    technique  is   the   power  of   abstraction. Rendering all  difference as  the  formal  difference between 0 and  1, the  digital claims   to   capture  every   difference  but   only   by   neutering  it,  by   draining difference of its dynamism, its generative or creative force.   Difference in the material, in the  actual,  is not  a static  posit  but  an activity,  an event.   The digital journals the results of this activity  but  always and  ever  fails to grasp its essence in action, its production.
