And  this  is  the  core  conflict  that  the  interface must   navigate, to  connect   the crystalline  abstractions  of  the  digital  code  to  the  overflowing  and   scattered attentions of the human.  Abstraction preserves a similarity of structure between the human and  digital domains.  But it draws off (tract, to draw + abs-, away)  the material specificity of the  human, leaving a skeleton of code  without a fleshy materiality.  Thus  stands the problem of the icon, the chief representative of the graphical user  interface.  The icon epitomizes the interface, a flat surface  with  its visible  side  turned toward the  user  and  its invisible side  facing  the  binary.  It stands between user  and  computer, or enactive and  symbolic, while  it stands for a file or a process and  presents in a perceptible form  some  of the  pure  possibility that is the modality of that digital file or process.
