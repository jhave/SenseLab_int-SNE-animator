The icon defines an area of geometric equipotential, such  that  clicking  anywhere within it  has  the  same   meaning.   This  is  its  unity   or  coherence,  its  object- orientation.    Presenting  the  general  availability  of  a  digital  object,  the  icon occupies a continuous planar field, an enclosed shape whose  geometric integrity corresponds to the purported coherence of the object it stands for.  Frequently, a click  anywhere within an  icon  has  a  uniform effect.    But  icons  can  also  be internally differentiated, where a particular part  is highlighted, or a click on one part  of the icon produces a result  different from a click elsewhere within the icon. In   general,  the   meaning  of   an   icon   derives  in   part   from   these   internal differentiations and  from  the possible visual  differences that  distinguish an icon from  others  like it or from  the  same  icon in a different state.   (An icon selected looks different from the same  icon unselected.  An icon representing an alias to a file looks marginally different from an icon representing the original file.   An unavailable process or menu item  appears dimmed or grayed out,  a possibility repealed, deferred, or aborted.)  The icon must  be read  against a field of its possibilities, what  it is not.
