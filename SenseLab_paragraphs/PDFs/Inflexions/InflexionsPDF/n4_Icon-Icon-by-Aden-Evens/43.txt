Prior  to this zero-width selection technique, text editing required that  a user  first put  the computer into a mode  suitable to her next operation, inserting, replacing, or deleting.  Kay’s trick  is to make  each  of these  operations digitally equivalent by  programming the  editor so  that  when the  user   has  no  text  selected,  the computer  nevertheless  “has”   a   selection  consisting  of   the   non-space,  the boundary between characters where the  cursor  is currently positioned.  Instead of a selection of a few contiguous characters or a single character, such as a space or a letter,  the selection has a width of zero.  As Kay explains, this allows  for each of the  three  operations to work  the  same  way:  whatever is next  typed replaces the  selection (and  if a  backspace or  delete   is  typed, this  replaces the  current selection with  a zero-width selection).
