(and  capitalized on) the underlying principle of the GUI: it puts  a human face on computing.   The  award-winning box  art  for  the  original  Macintosh featured primary colors  and   iconic  line  drawings, penned as  to  recall  the  crude and playful simplifications of a child’s hand.  A couple  of system updates down the road,   the  Macintosh startup  screen  put  the  sign  in  the  window (as  it  were), showcasing  the   “happy  Mac,”   a  drawing  of  an   early   Macintosh  all-in-one computer with  a smiley  face on its screen.   The happy Mac eventually insisted even   more   literally  on  the  amalgam  of  computer  and   human,  becoming a rectangular figure  of a monitor broken by a squiggly vertical  line to suggest eyes, nose, and  mouth.
