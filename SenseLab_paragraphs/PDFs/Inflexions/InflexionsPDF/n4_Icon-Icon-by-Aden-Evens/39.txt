ongoing progress, this analysis hints  at the losses that accompany the gains, suggesting that any interface design involves both advantages and  compromises. Windows and  mouse answer to the most general conundrum of interface design: the human and  digital domains are at odds,  and  the interface must  negotiate the awkward or uncomfortable juncture  of their  meeting.  In the  temporal domain the  digital follows  a linear  progress, each  tick of the  crystal  clock measuring a single-step advance;  past  and  future narrow to  a  slice  of  present, the  current value  of the output, the command to be executed.  For human beings,  the world is  confined neither to  a  linear   progress nor  to  a  narrow present;  our  world comprises a context  of attention, a simultaneous manifold availability of a whole perceptual field,  whose  meaning derives from  its  relations to  past  and  future. (Kay calls this  the  “flitting-about nature of the  iconic  mentality.”)  The human world is wide.   Modelessness expresses each world to the other,  simulating in the digital the  general availability of  context  by  rapidly circulating among many options,  one  at  a  time,   while   the  side   facing   the  human  retains its  digital surveyability, constituted by individual elements that  can be easily distinguished and  understood as wholly separate.8     Human consciousness is multiple, ambiguous, contingent, roaming, and  associative, and  the modeless GUI helps  to embed this  style  of thinking into  the  determinate, narrow, linear  process of the digital.
