natural or correct  resolution.  Every  interface involves its share  of compromises. Every interface encourages certain  choices over others  and  presents the digital to the  human in a particular light.   The history of the  interface is the  story  of the ongoing negotiation between digital and  human, and  the  two  domains do  not invariably approach each  other.    Individual elements of the  interface represent this negotiation in progress, a dynamic compromise that  avails  the user  of some aspects of the computer while  hiding or burying other  aspects.  How  to represent abstraction using  colors  and  shapes;  how  to  make  available something of the pure   possibility  of  the  digital  in  an  icon;  how   to  offer  an  invitation  and   a provocation, a learning environment and  a productive one; how  to stimulate creativity  in  a  context   of  prescribed  choice;  these   are  the  challenges  whose response is the developing design of the user interface.
