Its confinement to a vertical  plane  coincident with  the  monitor screen  gives  the icon   two   sides.   On   one   side   the   icon   presents  information  and   accepts instructions.   On  the  other  (virtual) side  the  icon  invokes a digital process, to open  a file, or change a font, or start  a calculation.  Thus,  the flatness  of the icon is no technological limitation, as though the  monitor imposed a final  constraint on it.  The interface may be graphical or visual,  but the objects to be manipulated in the  computer and  the  manipulations themselves are  digital, structural rather than  spatial, abstract rather than  material.  Some  data  may  lend  itself  to three- dimensional, spatial representation, but,  as I’ve been  arguing vis-à-vis  the  icon, the connection between data  and  visuality is usually strained at best.  Our chosen compromise so far has been  to deal  with  abstractions largely  in two dimensions, or rather, in planes. The original abstract image  was drawn in two dimensions or carved into  the  surface  of  a  plane.    (Perhaps a  club  wielded as  a  weapon is already the  abstract image  of a head  or a hand, a sculptural, three-dimensional abstraction.   But  the  club  is  an  abstraction only  after  the  fact,  for  it  remains precisely concrete, operative at the level of materiality.  Its structural similarity to the  head  is not  accidental, since  it serves  as the  basis  of the  club’s effectiveness for bashing heads, but  neither is its form  determined principally by a process of abstraction.)
