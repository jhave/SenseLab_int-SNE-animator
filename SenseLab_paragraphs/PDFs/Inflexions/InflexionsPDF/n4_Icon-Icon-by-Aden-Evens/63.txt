Other  interface elements fit even  more  comfortably into  the  logic  of the  icon. Menus  and  their  items  trigger digital processes, occupy  clearly  defined spaces, and  indicate a mouseover event  by lighting up.   The desktop itself acts iconically, accepting clicks  indifferently  over  its  whole   surface,   and   playing host  to  an image  that  is a  kind  of  pure  presentation with  only  an  aesthetic significance. Text  on  screen  functions as  an  archetypal icon,  the  iconic  principle in  action. Each character stands for itself, or, what  is the same  thing,  its difference from the others.     Clearly   defined,  each  character  nevertheless  has   a  great   variety  of standard  forms,   conventionally separated  into   fonts.     A  given   character  is significant primarily by  virtue of the  ideal  for  which  it stands, the  immaterial form  of the letter  that  takes  on a particular material instantiation in a given  font at  a given  size.   In  a digital text,  everything is encoded, encode-able, nothing escapes;   the   digital  letter   too   bears   an   oddly  arbitrary  relationship  to  its presentation, as  even  its  material appearance no  longer   grounds its  meaning. Instead it is the  digital code  “behind” the  letter  that  undergirds its significance, and   this   is  the   hallmark  of  the   icon,  an  essential relationship between an ultimately superficial appearance and  an  immaterial ideal  of code  “inside” the machine.
