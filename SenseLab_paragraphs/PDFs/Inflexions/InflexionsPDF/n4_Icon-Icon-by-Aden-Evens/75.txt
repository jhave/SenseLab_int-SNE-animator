9   As  is  evident  throughout  Kay’s   writing  and   video   presentations,  he   is genuinely  modest  and   inordinately  generous,  deferring  credit   and acknowledging the  contributions of  his  collaborators and  of  the  many   others who  often  inspired his ideas,  labored to implement them,  or developed similar ideas  in parallel.  I have  elided from  this  quotation about  zero-length selections Kay’s acknowledgement that  Larry Tesler had  already developed this same idea. It is less important to identify the  author of an idea  than  to celebrate its worth. For   each   of   the   inventions  attributed   in   this   present  essay   to   Kay,   he acknowledges multiple authorship, and  a broad range  of significant influences.
