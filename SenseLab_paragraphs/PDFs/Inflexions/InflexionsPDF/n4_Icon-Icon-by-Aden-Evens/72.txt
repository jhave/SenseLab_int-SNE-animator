6  Note  that  the  flat planes of the  computer interface not  only  fall short  of three dimensions because they  are flat, but also because, aside  from  the top plane,  the order of the  planes makes  little  difference.   The  z-dimension for  each  plane  is maintained  for  visual   consistency  and   legibility,  but   the   layering  does   not distinguish in any  significant way  between the second plane  from  the  front  and the  rearmost plane.    Perhaps the  desktop constitutes a counterexample, as it is always the rearmost plane  and  so also has a kind  of priority, as when a command allows  the user to sweep temporarily everything off of the desktop so as to access the icons that sit always on that desktop.
