what  is going  on.   But after  two  or three  nearly  identical episodes, you  come  to recognize the  signs,  the  elements of this  icon unfolding in sequence.  Soon you develop a strategy for  evading the  cordon of police  (make  for  the  rooftops?), thence  employing it at need,  with  the  siren  triggering your  response so rapidly that  you have  left the scene before  the gunshots ring out.   (Perhaps you still hear the shots if the icon is especially stubborn.)
