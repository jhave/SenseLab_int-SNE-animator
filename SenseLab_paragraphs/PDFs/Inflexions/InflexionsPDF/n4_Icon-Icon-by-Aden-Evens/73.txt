7  A quick  note  of explanation:  If a point  is zero-dimensional and  a line  is one- dimensional, then  the  process of the  CPU  in a computer measures in between these  two  dimensionalities, as it can be thought of as the  leading edge  of a line being  drawn, the current operation at the end  of a chain  of operations.  The GUI is two-to-threeâ€“dimensional  because it layers  two-dimensional planes in a third dimension of depth.  Critics  sometimes call this a 2.5-dimensional or 2.5D visual perspective.
