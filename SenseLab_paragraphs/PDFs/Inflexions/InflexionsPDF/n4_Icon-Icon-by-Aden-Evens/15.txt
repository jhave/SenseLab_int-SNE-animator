From  Xerox’s corporate perspective in the  ’70s, Kay’s researches into  a personal computing  interface may  have  seemed rather pointless:  why  would scientists, engineers, and  information technologists want  computers with  cute little images on the  screen?   They  charged Apple  a laughably small  fee to incorporate Kay’s interface concepts into  their  new  operating system.   Though Kay  was  not  the creator of the  happy Mac image,  it might  still be thought of as his signature on the Macintosh interface, for it underlines the core principles of his conception of how  the  interface should work.    Kay inherits his pedagogy from  American psychologist  Jerome   Bruner,   who   loosely   adapts from  Jean  Piaget   a developmentalism, modifying the relatively strict developmental stages  of Piaget to  allow   for  lifelong   learning  and   change.   Bruner   identifies three   stages   of mentality, the  enactive, the  iconic,  and  the  symbolic. The  standard paraphrase holds  that  the enactive mentality, dominant in infancy,  is about  acting  bodily  on the world, the iconic, onset  in early  childhood, is about  images  and  resemblance, and  the symbolic, blossoming in adolescence, is about  abstract connections.1
