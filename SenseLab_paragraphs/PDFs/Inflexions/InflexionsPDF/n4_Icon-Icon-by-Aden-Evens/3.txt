An abiding fantasy of the digital age imagines the computer so attuned to human desire  that  it responds almost  instantly to the user’s slightest gesture.  This ideal computer  would  require  no   mediation  to   grasp  and    execute    the   user’s instructions.  The human complement to this  machine would be the  ideal  user, one  who  has  internalized the  computer’s  capacities to such  a degree that  they feel natural; she would offer her commands in a language already assimilable to the digital algorithms of the computer.  This fantasy of immediacy, identified in Jay Bolter’ and  Richard Grusin’s Remediation as one  of two  opposed drives that characterize new  media, locates  its telos in the disappearance of the interface.  It is tempting to regard the  user  interface as a crutch,  an intermediary that  sullies the otherwise pure  relationship we could  have  to the digital domain “inside” the computer.  To eliminate the interface would promote an immediate and  intuitive relationship to the machine, saving  much  needless effort.  “Intel research scientist Dean  Pomerleau told  Computerworld that  users  will soon  tire of depending on a computer  interface, and  having to  fish  a device  out  of their  pocket  or  bag  to access  it.  He  also  predicted that  users   will  tire  of  having  to  manipulate an interface  with   their   fingers.   Instead,  they'll   simply manipulate  their   various devices  with  their brains” (Gaudin, 2009).
