1  Piaget  proposes human development in four  stages:  sensorimotor stage,  from birth  to age 2; preoperational stage,  from  ages 2 to 7; concrete operational stage, from  ages  7 to 12; and  formal  operational stage,  from  age  12 onwards. Bruner borrows from Piaget throughout his career; his three  stages  of learning are not so chronologically anchored as  Piagetâ€™s  four  stages  and  are  discussed directly in Toward a Theory of Instruction (Harvard University Press, 1966).
