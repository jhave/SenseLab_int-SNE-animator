Crucially,  not   only   digital  states   but   also   digital  processes  become   objects punctuated in the  interface, captured by an  icon  or  a menu item.   Prior  to the icon, one would only encounter a file in the course  of an operation on it.3   Now  it sits in plain  sight  on the desktop ready to be clicked,  indicating its existence  and availability.  The computer’s contents are  laid  bare  by the  GUI, such  that  it not only  invites  experimentation and  use  but  also reveals  its inner  order to the  eye, lowering its threat by voluntarily disclosing its innards.4   The GUI renders some objects  and   some   actions   close  at  hand,  promoting those   objects  and   those actions,  calling  the  user’s  attention to the  set  of possibilities surrounding those objects.  Visuality rather than  logic or memory comes to dominate the interaction with  the  computer, not  only  foregrounding certain   choices,  but  changing the kind  of cognition associated with computer use.
