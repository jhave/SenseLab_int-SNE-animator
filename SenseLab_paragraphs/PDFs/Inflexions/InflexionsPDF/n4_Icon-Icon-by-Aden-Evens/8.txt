by   the   many   applications  hosted  within  the   GUI,   from   three-dimensional projections  in a gaming window to the  hyperlinked space  of a browser to  the infinite,   indexed cells  of  a  spreadsheet.   These  are  not  easily  recognizable as artifacts from  atop  someone’s  desk,  but  then  we  don’t  tend   to  decorate our cubicles   with   icons,   either.      The  desktop  metaphor  was   only   ever   a  thin contrivance for directing the intuition, to give a hint of the familiar to an esoteric technology.   Young people, too naive  to be intimidated by computers and unburdened by  the  rigorous adult demand for  metaphorical consistency, were possibly the perfect  audience for the desktop and  the GUI built on top of it.  The GUI rendered the computer much  easier  to use without expertise but  at the cost of some power and  efficiency, a technology of a lower  common denominator.
