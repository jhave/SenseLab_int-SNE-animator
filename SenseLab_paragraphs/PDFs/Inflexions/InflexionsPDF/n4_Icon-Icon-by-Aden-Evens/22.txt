With a graphical interface, many  items  and  many  operations are simultaneously available, visible on the screen  and  ready to be clicked.   Instead of entering codes according  to  an  inflexible   syntax,   one  need   only  point   to  a  location   on  the monitor and  click there.   For Kay, this  flat simplicity of the  interface promoted creative possibilities: “The flitting-about nature of the iconic mentality suggested that  having as  many  resources showing on  the  screen  as  possible would be  a good  way  to encourage creativity and  problem solving  and  prevent blockage” (Kay,   2001:  129).5        Filling   the   monitor  screen   with   icons   encourages  the recognition of unforeseen connections, the choice of otherwise unfamiliar operations.  In part  the novelty presented to the user  derives from the flatness  of the   GUI:   not   only   does    the   flat   monitor  surface    allow    only   a   limited representation  of  depth and   a  relative  simplicity  of  structure, but  this  same interface  admits   the    juxtaposition    of   heterogeneous   digital   objects    and operations.  The icon for a volume of data  can sit on the desktop next to the icon of a text clipping containing a phone number.  There  is little  in the  interface to suggest the disparity of these  two adjacent icons, and  from the user’s perspective they   are  indeed mostly   equipotent.   Each  can  be  opened,  copied,   renamed, moved around, or removed from  the  desktop.  The  interface helps  to hide  the differences between these elements, and  the consequent misrecognition may well spark  some   creative  accidents.    A  visual   interface  encourages  unexpected
