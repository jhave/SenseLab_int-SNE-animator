There may be a number of things that  we do with  computers that benefit   from   a   representation  in   three   dimensions,  but   not   most   things. Simulated three-dimensionality could  become  wildly popular as a medium on the  computer, but  the  primary computer interface will  remain stubbornly two- dimensional, icons, windows, documents, layers,  desktops.  Some scientists and engineers can  work   effectively   in  three   dimensions, as  can  plenty of  artists, educators and  business people.  Gamers have  a field  day  in a simulated space.
