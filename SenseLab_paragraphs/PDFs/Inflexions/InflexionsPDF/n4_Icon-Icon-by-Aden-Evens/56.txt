The icon reports the results of alterations to the object, showing both  current and possible states.   As style guides frequently remark, the icon exists as a collection of similarities and  differences.  It is related by similarity to a group of other  icons that  it  resembles, which   tells  the  user  that  it  represents a  particular kind   of document or is associated with  a particular application or can perform some particular kind  of  function.   Icons  for  mathematical operations might   have  a different visual  style  than  do icons for alphabetic manipulations, for example. It is related by difference to every  other  icon, including even  itself.   That is, its differences not only  distinguish it as the particular icon it is (for one application versus a different application, or  a cut  operation versus a copy  operation) but also distinguish its current status.
