The  GUI does  not  merely substitute suggestive images  (icons)  where formerly had  been  elliptical codes;  it is not just a less intimidating means  of accessing  the same   possibilities.    Locating   the  icon  between  the  material  mouse  and   the symbolic binary, the  GUI presents a different regime of possibility, a different structure  of  computing.  How   does   the   GUI  convey   the   availability  of  the computer to the  user?   It encapsulates digital objects  into  icons,  imbuing those objects with  a visual  and  affective  coherence.2   Arraying digital objects in space, the  GUI establishes relationships among those  objects.  It provides an  enduring visual  presence to the objects “in”  the computer, altering a fundamental tenet  of computing: one need  no longer  already know  what  the computer can do in order to work  with  it.
