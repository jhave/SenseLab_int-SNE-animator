Introducing the computer for the rest of us, the GUI marked a decisive  step in the history of the digital.  During the  â€™70s, the  computer was  an administrative and research tool, increasingly adopted by hobbyists, by the upwardly mobile,  and  in classrooms.   In  1984 the  Macintosh brought  the  GUI,  under development for more  than  fifteen  years,  into  the  mainstream.   No  more  lists  of commands to memorize, no more  arcane  codes  and  rigid  syntax.   Much  of what  the computer has to offer to the user  is illuminated right  on the surface  by the flickering pixels of the monitor, outlining objects on which  to act and  suggesting possible actions for those  objects.
