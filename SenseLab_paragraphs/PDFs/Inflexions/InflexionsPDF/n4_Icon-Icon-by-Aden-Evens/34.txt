Modelessness was one of the watchwords of this transformative technological invention, but Kay introduced other  substantive emphases in designing the interface.    He  gives   special   credit   to  the   inventions  of  Douglas  Engelbart. Engelbart’s  complementary developments of windows and  mouse might  stem from  a common inspiration, the  flat  window of the  monitor screen.    The  light pen,  similar  to today’s  ubiquitous stylus,  was  very  useful  for  certain  tasks  but was  not  in  general an  ergonomic input device,  especially when used   with  a keyboard.  Not only did  it obstruct visibility of the screen  on which  the user  was “drawing”, but  it also required an awkward arrangement of the  user’s body,  to write  on a monitor positioned vertically at arm’s length.  Engelbart recognized, however, that in the digital domain even place could  be dislocated and re-placed.
