backspace, it  would not  achieve   the  intended result   to  replace   the  zero-width selection with  another zero-width selection.  In  effect,  nothing would happen. Instead,  special   code  must   be  included for  this  very   situation.  One  way   of addressing  the  issue   is  to  check   whether  this   situation  obtains  (a  backspace pressed when nothing is selected) and  if so, to immediately and  automatically select  the  character right  before  the  zero-width  selection, then  to proceed with the replace  operation.  In other  words, select the previous character then  replace it with  nothing.  Such complications to accomplish something seemingly simple (a backspace) may  be  typical  of solutions in  computing, which  gather together multiple cases into  a common set of code  but  sometimes by leaving out  certain exceptional cases.
