What would be more  iconic than  a smiley  face?  The happy Mac is the epitome of the  icon,  the  iconic  icon.   The  smiling face—eyes,  nose,  and  mouth—resonates deep  within our  brains,  such  that  even  the  simplified line-drawing of a smiley refers  immediately to an elemental experience, a neural structure basic to human being.   But the  happy Mac is not  a face, only  ever  an icon of one.  Its simplified features do  not  so  much   resemble as  signify   the  face,  as  underlined  by  the generic  figural  language of the smiley,  seen on t-shirts and  bumper stickers.   The happy Mac  enacts   a  strange  self-referential logic:  shortly  after  powering up under Mac OS 8.6, the Macintosh computer screen  shows  a small iconic image  of the  original Macintosh, on the  tiny  screen  of which  are the features of a generic smiley  face.   This cheery  icon indicates that  the  startup sequence is proceeding correctly, that a disk with  bootable software has been located and is being read  in to memory. The on-screen representation of an iconic computer stages  one of the central  problems of the  digital interface, namely, that  the  materials available to present on  a computer are  always already digital and  hence  iconic  or  generic. The interface can only  present what  is digital, offering  to the  user  the  computer “inside” the  computer.  The smiling face on the  iconic  computer screen  pushes back  against this  tail-swallowing digital trap;  after  all, the  point  of including a smiling face is to insist,  against all evidence, on the  underlying humanity of the computer.
