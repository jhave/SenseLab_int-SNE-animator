computing hardware.  The  computer follows  a linear  process, accepting input, processing that  input through a series of logical calculations, and  then  producing an output.  Each tick of the clock yields  the next state.  The text-based, command line interface mirrors this linear  process of computing.  It spews out  a stream of data,  each  character proceeding the  previous one,  each  line  following the  last, and  only  the  most  recent  information is current or  active.    The  command line prompt represents the  context  of current operations, an edge  between what  has been  established (above  the prompt) and  what  is still to be calculated (below  the prompt).  The text already on the  screen  (or printed out  on the  printer) is inert, showing former states  of the  program that  are not  available except  as a passive reference.
