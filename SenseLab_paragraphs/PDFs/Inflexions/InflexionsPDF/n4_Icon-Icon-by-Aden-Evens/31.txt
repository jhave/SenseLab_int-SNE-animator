Modelessness typifies  progress in the  history of the  interface, as many  interface innovations  compress  the  temporal  dimension  of  computing.    Consider  the history of the  interface in terms  of the  shift from  batch  processing to interactive processing.     For   the   first   twenty  years   of   commercial digital  computing, computing resources were  scarce and  most computers were  shared among many projects   and  many   users.    Rather   than  interacting with  the  machine directly, users  would submit programs (for example, on  punch cards)  to a queue, to be run  in their  turn.    Fed  into  the  computer, the  program would run  for the  most part   without human interaction:  input program, output result.     A  bunch of programs to be run  were  a batch, so this style of allocating scarce  resources over time with  little interaction during program execution was called  batch processing. Batch processing takes for granted the perspective of the computer, and  does  not work  to accommodate the  exigencies of human being.   That  is, a batch  process assumes that  the  computerâ€™s  state  can  be  known in  advance, that  it  will  not
