Preexisting those  who  enter  them,  architectural surrounds stand as elaborately structured pretexts for action  â€¦ Organisms that  person need  to construct their  hypotheses and  enter  them,  surrounding themselves with  ordered presentations of their  suppositions. Our claim:  architecture can help  a person figure  herself  out.  (Gins  and Arakawa 2002: 41-44)
