The  dimensionalising  category of  landing sites  is  of  most  importance to  my purposes here,  for it most  accurately describes the way  we come to engage with the   looming  specter  of  chronic   overpopulation,  resource  depletion,  global warming and  species  extinction. Dimensionalising describes how  we  can  relate to  these  events   and,  given  the  consequences of  not  doing   anything about   it, understand the co-extensive nature of our  actions  as they  are instantiated in the here  and   now.   Dimensionalising landing  sites  articulate the  broader context within which  organism persons are situated as temporally extended beings  with a past  - but  more  importantly a future - that  urgently needs  to be re-constructed ideologically, etymologically and  architecturally. In this sense, what  is important to all three  landing site configurations are not only the ways  in which  we land  on them  but in turn,  once landed, the way upon which  we launch from them.  Here, a landing site  becomes  correspondingly a ‘launching pad’, and  given  the tentativeness that  is the  hallmark of Arakawa and  Gins  work,  make  the  two  - landing and  launching - a synonymous activity.  You can never  rest  for too long on a landing site, nor relax from  the tentative state  that  put  you there  in the first instance, meaning that  a landing site is a pace  for fleeting  re-assessment before the next move or ‘leap’.
