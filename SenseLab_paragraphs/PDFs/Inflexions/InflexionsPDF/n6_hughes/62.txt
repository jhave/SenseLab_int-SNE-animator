The way that the body  holds  itself, the many  ways  it holds  itself, on many  different scales  of action,  and  the  way  it holds  the  world is cumulative. All the holdings you  have  experienced, all the holding of  you  and  by  you,  moves  within and  through your  holding of yourself and has a part  in your  holding onto something. (2002: 83)
