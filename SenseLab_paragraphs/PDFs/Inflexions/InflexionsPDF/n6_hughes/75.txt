the self as the quintessential act of recoding the I. Deregulation enables the reinvention  of  our   species   by  allowing  us  pull   together under  a  common purpose, precisely because it lets ourselves form,  unfettered, “as separate individuals” (Gins  and  Arakawa 2002: xi). Through difference, diversity and complexity  we  are  offered   the  best  shot   for  success   against  the  ravages  of monocultural  entropy  generation.  The  exploration  and   amplification  of  our unique individual idiosyncrasy to  the  nth  degree, is  the  most  viable  means   of constructing  the  conditions  capable of  doing   this.  The  glue  that   binds   such endeavours together, the “communal purpose” of the species sought by Gins and Arakawa (2002: xxi), is the ‘freedom’ enabled by deregulation for each and  every one of us to act responsibly and  design a future from  the position where “it can no longer  be assumed that  we,  en masse, have  a future” (Fry 2009: 1). If radical problems call for equally - if not more  radical solutions - who  can really  say for sure how far into the future Arakawa and Gins prescience may extend?
