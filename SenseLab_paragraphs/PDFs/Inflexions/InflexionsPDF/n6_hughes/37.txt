material resources. Given  the constraints imposed upon these  best intentions by the converging crises of overpopulation, resource depletion, global warming and species  extinction, I return now  to the question of how  else might  the transformational  potentials  claimed  in  the   architectural  body   hypothesis  be enacted, and  in a way  that  does  not demand vast  sums  of money, resources and what  the  species  is most  running out  of - time - to produce it? Could  it be that everything we need,  tentatively, is already here,  and  that  transforming ourselves within it is merely a case of re-interpreting or ‘reading’ the surrounds differently, in a way  that  “procedurally” re-invents the  organism that  persons as it moves through a biotopology (Arakawa and Gins 2006) of pre-existing landing sites?
