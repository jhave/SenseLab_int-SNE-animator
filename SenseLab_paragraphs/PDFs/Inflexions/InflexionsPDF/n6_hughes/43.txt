According to Gins and Arakawa, the world as it is, and why it fails us in the form of own mortality, is due  to what  they identify as “procedurally insufficient bioscleave” (2002: 95); that  is, a world that  has not had  the necessary procedures inserted  into  it  to  orientate  our   own   lives  toward  an  openly  ongoing  end. However, there   are  limitations to  this  formula. Arakawa and  Gins  have  not stipulated anywhere near  enough the  extent  of the  reciprocity implicit in their idea  of ‘procedural sufficiency’. For, though we may  aspire  to sustain ourselves indefinitely using  bioscleave, first  and  foremost we  surely  need  to identify our own lack of procedural awareness for learning to sustain - what  it is that sustains us? It is at this point  that  I deviate from Gins and  Arakawa’s core trajectories, for although I share  their call for a “crisis ethics” (2002: xviii), I baulk  at the obsessive preoccupation  with   overcoming individual  mortality,  displacing  this  instead with   the  more   pressing concern   of  the  species   mortality  as  a  whole   as  the
‘outcome’ or teleology of procedural knowing and  doing.  If the ongoing solution to death, be it of the individual or of the species,  is through the re-proceduring of bioscleave,  then   that   has   to  happen  first  by  derailing  procedural  knowing. Arakawa and  Gins believe  that  the best course  of action  is to build  architectural environments  that   communities  of  people  can  live  in  and   learn   from.   The question I instead seek, is whether such a disruption can occur independent of the wide  scale building of tactically-posed, architectural surrounds? I believe  it can, partially, through  the  construction not  of  architecture, but  the  language that precedes it. As Jean-Jacques Lecercle explains:
