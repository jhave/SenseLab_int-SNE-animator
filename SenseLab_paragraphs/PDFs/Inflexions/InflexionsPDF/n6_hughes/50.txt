Browsing Arakawa  and   Gins  book  titles  provides a  stark   reminder  of  their obsession for linguistic violence:  Reversible Destiny: We Have Decided Not to Die (1997), Making Dying Illegal (2006), Alive Forever Not If but When (2011). Here  titles stand for “events” (Lecercle 2006) that forge into the moment of the everyday the possibility of contemplating the impossible, which  has the effect of rupturing but for an instant (albeit  in a state  of shock, horror, and/or outrage and  ridicule) our taken  for granted assumption of the  ‘is’. Such  violence  to established, habitual, “procedurally known” linguistic protocol opens  a space of contemplation, if only momentarily, that forces a reconsideration of what  our beliefs or expectations are and/or possibly could  be.
