Landing sites  are  used   by  Gins  and   Arakawa to  describe the  way  attention operates and  to simultaneously map  the way these  attentions come to know themselves and  situate the  body,  albeit  tentatively, within an environment. The production  of  landing  site  configurations  enable   organisms  that   person  the ability  to be mindful of the way awareness is distributed in order to: “gain perspective on  human functioning and  separate out  its  component factors  ... kinaesthetically, tactilely,  visually, orally,  olfactorily, and  gustatorily all at once” (2002: 13). Landing sites operate on three  levels or scales that  are singular to themselves yet also overlap simultaneously, slipping seamlessly into  and  out  of each another. These are “perceptual,” “imaging” and “dimensionalising” landing sites.
