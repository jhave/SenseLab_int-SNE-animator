Gins  and  Arakawa state  that  a perceptual landing site:  “lands narrowly as  an immediate and  direct  response to a probable existent,  a bit of reporting on what presents itself”  (2002: 7). Perceptual landing sites are what  grab  attention in the immediate; the object in front of you, the text on a page,  the nearness of anything that  is so  proximate as  to  be  right  there  in  the  here  and  now.  Conversely an imaging landing site:  “lands widely and  in  an  un  pin  pointing way,  dancing attendance on the  perceptual landing site, responding indirectly and  diffusedly to whatever the latter  leaves unprocessed” (2002: 8). Imaging landing sites can be thought of as the next stage away  from the perceptual, what’s happening later in the day,  what’s going  on just around the corner,  what  you can feel but can’t see, the not quite  here  and  now  but  getting there  as the pre-cursor to the perceptual. A  dimensionalising  landing  site   is  quite   different  from   the   imaging and perceptual landing sites, as it loosens  and  widens its cast of attention to draw in the  bigger  picture so to speak,  even  if the  elements thereof  are imperceptible in form and substance:
