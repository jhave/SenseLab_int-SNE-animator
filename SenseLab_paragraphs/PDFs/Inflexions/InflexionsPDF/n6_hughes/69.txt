The researcher in residence, practising the art of being  one of the many  bodies  of an  architectural body,  attains transformational capability by  researching daily the  operations of what  makes  the  body,  individual and  species  alike,  tick.  My doctoral  research  describes  the   way   subject-hood   in   the   21st    century   is increasingly understood as a construct of information, a product of the emergent genomic and  molecular  technologies that  now  come  to  define   it  (Rose  2001, Rabinow and  Rose 2003, Waldby 2005, Neilson 2006). In light  of the  advent of synthetic   biology,    where  whole    new    biological    organisms   can   now    be constructed  from   biological   ‘bits’  or  “BioBricks,”   a  practice  that   is  actively evolving as an open  source,  ‘Do It Yourself’ (DIY) cultural phenomenon, I argue that  the  emergent ‘molecular’  subject  will  not  only  begin  to  engineer biology
