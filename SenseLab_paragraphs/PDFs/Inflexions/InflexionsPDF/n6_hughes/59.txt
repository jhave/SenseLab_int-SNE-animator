According to this definition ‘bodies’, are the most  dynamic element, the primary “reckonable   resource”   (Glazebrook   2010:   2)   or    building   blocks    of   the architectural  surround,   both    as   the    creators   of   architecture,   but    more importantly, as the architecture itself. The answer, if we  are  looking  for one,  has been right  in front  of, if not under, behind and  above  our noses  all this time. In a world of  diminishing  resources, the  one  thing   we  do  have  in  ever  growing abundance is ourselves. If tactically-posed surrounds  need  to  be  constantly changing (a  problem with  their  buildings because they  don’t  move  and  thus become  familiar over  time,  hence  the need  to build  enormous structures such  as hotels  and  cities so that  spatially one cannot  grow  accustomed to them)  can this instead be achieved through the co-construction of actual  (architectural) bodies, which  are both  collectively and  alone  the most  dynamic element within the architectural surround? This can happen I believe,  as we begin  to envision architecture as the “critical  holder” of ourselves.
