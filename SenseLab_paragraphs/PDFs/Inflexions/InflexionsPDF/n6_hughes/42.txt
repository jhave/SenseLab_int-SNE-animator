of ‘learned helplessness’ in the  discipline of psychology, procedural knowing is wrought in the habitual momentum of tradition forged  by a psychology where: “Nobody wants to  be  caught not  getting the  ‘“real”’  straight” (xiv).  Thus  the status quo  further entrenches itself, institutes itself (de Certeau 1986) as the sole agent  of the  real,  imposing artificially abstracted limitations on  organisms that person. Arakawa and  Gins use procedural architecture to undo the autonomous process  of repeating or reiterating procedural knowing by forcing  the  organism that   persons to  examine  the  operations and   processes  of  life  as  a  tentative, moment  by   moment   sequence  that,    when    understood  as   such,    can   be procedurally re-worked.
