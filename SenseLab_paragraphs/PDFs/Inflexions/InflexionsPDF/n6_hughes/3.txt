The increasing violence  and  destruction in the world – physical, ecological,  economic, social and  emotional – are all a product of our present modes of  thought. If the  cruelty is  to  end,  our  concepts must   change.  Since  our  concepts are  physically encoded  in  the brain   and   grounded  in  the  body,   our   brains   and   bodies   must change. If art  is to  play  a role  for  the  good,  it must  disrupt our concepts, our  normal ways  of  functioning – our  brains   and  our bodies  … Moreover art  as disruption on a large  enough scale will be sufficient to reverse our destiny. (Lakoff 1997: 120)
