We speak  of an architectural body,  rather than  an architectural field or an architectural context  simply because, to begin  with,  what  we want  to  describe originates from  and  joins  up  with  the  physical body.  Think  of the body  proper as lending some  of its body  to the architectural surround, which,  in turn,  lends  some  of what characterizes it as architectural to the body  proper. (2002: 68)
