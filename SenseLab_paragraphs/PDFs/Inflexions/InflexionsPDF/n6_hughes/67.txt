Deregulation from each other delivers the  self the  opportunity to act responsibly and with  authority, which  I argue  we as individuals currently cannot  (or fail to) do  because we  perceive the  problem as too  large  and  beyond anything but  the omnipotence of governmental and  institutional bodies  to influence. I believe  this is the  result  of cultural conditioning, of a learned helplessness produced by subservience  to  institutional  arrangements,  where  all  ethics   and   agency   are displaced by the  aphorism that  ‘it’s under control’.  How  to untangle ourselves from  the inertia  and  complacency wrought in the habitual, how  to learn  to ‘un- learn’ the procedurally known, to become  ‘embodiedmindful’ of the many dimensions of landing site  awareness required of each  and  every  one  of us  to construct a future, is all in day’s work.
