This  sense  of  an  interconnected holding/being  held  collapses any  distinction between the body,  the architecture that  houses it and  the biosphere (bioscleave) that  predicates its existence,  necessarily dissolving any  conceptual demarcation between ‘nature’ and  ‘artifice’, or ‘organism that  persons’ and  ‘bioscleave’. In the context  of the biopolitical paradox, Gins and  Arakawa point  out: “In the twenty- first  century, philosophers  need   to  construct the  conditions what   will  cause answers to be forthcoming” (2002: 88). Interesting to note  in this passage is how constructing “the  conditions” can also mean  simply constructing the  conditions of interpretation, of figuring new  ways  of doing  the  same  things in  the  same spaces.  In light of the popularity of deconstruction as an interpretative practice in the latter  half of the twentieth century, so too is re-construction possible through a hermeneutic, interpretative re-arrangement of the shape  of awareness, made available through the  heuristic thought procedures of Arakawa and  Gins.  This can translate into the shifting of habits  from the way we use resources to the expectations we  have  as  consumers and  concomitantly, reciprocally, harvesters and/or producers of those  resources. Arakawa and  Gins  hermeneutic approach to leafing  through the  world enables a starting point  to begin  thinking the  (re) construction (again,  albeit differently) of the (emergent) conditions for life, where every  ‘thing’ becomes  reconsidered, reusable, recyclable and  redirected (Fry 2009). Here,  everything is useful  - nothing is thrown away.  Indeed, a place  where no such thing  as ‘nothing’ exists.
