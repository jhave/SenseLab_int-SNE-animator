I frame  anthropogenic entropy generation, and  the need  to reverse this  destiny, via  what   I  call  the   ‘biopolitical  paradox’.  The  ageing   of  the   Baby  Boomer demographic   bulge    in   Western   developed   countries,   coupled   with    the biopolitical withdrawal of state responsibility for the care of this population in an era of rapidly developing biotechnological potential, produces a newly  emergent biopolitical context  I call ‘Immortalist Biopolitics’. Here perennially ageing, intensively  resource-dependent  populations  become   the  quintessential expression   of   ‘unlimited’   economic  growth   within   what    is   increasingly recognised as a ‘finite’  biospheric context.  Given  the  as yet  nascent - yet  much promised - ‘Biopolitics of the Biosphere’  (the globally  unified response to the convergent  biospheric  crisis   of   overpopulation,   resource  depletion,  global warming and   species   extinction) this  paradox threatens the  tenability of  the species  beyond this  “critical  century” (Rees 2007). I seek  to theorise ways  with which   to  suture  this   paradox,  and   not   through  the   inertia  of  ‘top   down’ institutional authority that  has  and  arguably will  continue to  fail  to  make  the necessary transformation required, but  rather, target  - as do contemporary biopolitical interventions - the  individual ‘self’. Argued here  as the  agent  most capable   of  making  transformative  change  toward  a  “futuring”  (Fry   2009) condition, I seek  to instantiate this  futuring self using  approaches from contemporary art  and  design theory and  practice, predominantly  the  work  of Arakawa and Gins.
