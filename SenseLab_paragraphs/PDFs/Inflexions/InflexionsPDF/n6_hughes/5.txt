My relationship to Arakawa and Gins work  has been one of applying their multi- faceted  project  to  site-specific contexts  for  which  reversible destiny, as  both  a concept  and  practice, are more  than  required. My studies have  included research into the application of reversible destiny architecture as a means  to avoid  the imminent  dementia  epidemic  facing   Western  developed  countries  (Hughes
2005); a redirection of Arakawa and  Ginsâ€™ Making Dying  Illegal (2006) from outlawing individual mortality through senescent decline,  but  unnecessary and avoidable death caused by  disease, famine  and  war  (Hughes 2008); and  more recently, as  a way  of redirecting the  species  away  from  its  role  as  a terminal entropy generator par excellence (Hughes 2010). It is this  latter  focus  that  is the
core concern  of my doctoral research (Hughes 2011) and this paper.
