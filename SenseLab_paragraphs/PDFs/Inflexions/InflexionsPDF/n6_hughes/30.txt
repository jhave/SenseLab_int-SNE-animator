As stated Gins  and  Arakawa’s foray  into  architecture has  been  their  means  of accessing  the  transformational potentials of the  emergent cognitive hypothesis. First, however, we have  to recognize the limitations imposed upon the cognitive body  by  the  status quo,  reinforced by  an  architecture whose  historical legacy comes  from  a culture building ‘monuments’  or  ‘tombs’  for  the  dead:  “Let  our species   cease  being   stunned into  silence  and   passivity,  into  defeatism,  by  a formal  architecture that  seems  so accomplished but  that  leads  nowhere” (2002:
