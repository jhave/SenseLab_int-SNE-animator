embodied cognition and  communal devising do exist to a limited degree, as does the  potential to  accordingly retrofit   the  existing   built  environment. However, given  the  urgency that  confronts our  species  to  make  transformative change swiftly,  I believe  a more  accessible,  quick-fire, pop-up  emergency architectural body  is required, capable  of catalyzing the  transformative potential they  speak of,  without  actually  building  anything  at   all.   The   procedure  required  to understand  this   remarkable  possibility  is  to   re-examine  Architectural   Body, mindful (‘embodiedmindful’)  of what  reversible destiny might  really  mean  in context  of the challenges to be faced in the 21st century.
