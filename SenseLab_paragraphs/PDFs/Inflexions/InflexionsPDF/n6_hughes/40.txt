…  embodied  mind,  a   current  way   of   referring  to   mind  or awareness so as to give body  its due,  extends out beyond the body proper into  the architectural surround; the surrounding bioscleave needs    to   be   weighed  in   as   part    of   awareness’s   body.    This hypothesis would  have   us  never   forget   that   we  are  babies   of bioscleave and  are therefore only  comprehensible (to ourselves) in terms  of it. (2002: 51)
