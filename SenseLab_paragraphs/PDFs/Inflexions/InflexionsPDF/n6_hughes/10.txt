Contrary to  the  common practice of solving  in  concrete  terms  the  ontological mystery of  what   our  species   is,  Arakawa and   Gins  do  not  seek  to  posit  an abstract scheme  or knowledge with  which  to ‘know’ our  species,  rather, it is the very   uncertainty  of  our   being   that   they   embrace  as  its  definitive  guiding principle. Arakawa and  Gins  immersive environments transport the  cognitive body  into  a laboratory of self/world examination. My-self  and  others  preceding me  have  analyzed the  synergic relationship between Arakawa and  Gins  work and  the  emergent cognitive hypothesis from  the  discipline of cognitive science (Kawamoto 2002, Rosenberg 2002, Hughes 2006). Here  cognition, consciousness and   perception  are  understood  as  the  result   of  the  spontaneous  emergence between the brain,  the embodied sensorium and  environmental stimuli external to  the   epidermal  surface   of  the   body   (Varela,   Thomson  and   Rosch   1991). Arakawa and  Gins architectural procedures, predicated as they are on the notion that  we  are  “puzzle creatures” to ourselves, recasts  their  vision  for the  species from   this   contradictory  platform  of  uncertainty,  and   draw  attention to  the malleable nature of the  cognitive body  (formerly the  concrete,  eternal, rational
‘I’) and  how its evolutionary impetus can be accessed,  augmented and  ultimately accelerated through architecture. The arguments I will be making here, however, suggest   that    such    transformative   potentials   may    have    to    be   accessed independently of the architectural context  they propose.
