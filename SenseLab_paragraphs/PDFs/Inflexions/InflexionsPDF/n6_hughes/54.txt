Arakawa and  Gins  use  coordinology as the  linking  process  to skillfully address the  way  the  cognitive body   holds   several   things ‘on  the  go’  at  once.  Like  a juggling  technique,  coordinology  holds   multiple  scales  of  attention simultaneously, enabling a perspective from  which  to translate information and meaning analogously across many  attentions, actions,  practices and  ‘disciplinary’ domains. Gins  and  Arakawa define  it as: “Not  a series  of actions  taken  on this scale  of action  or  that  but  the  coordinating of several  scales  of action  makes  a person able to construct a world” (2002: 63).
