The  organism  that   persons  is  one  of  Arakawa  and   Gins  many   and   varied neologistic naming tendencies or  ‘terminological  junctions’  (itself  a  neologism that   is  an  example  of  what   it  represents)  that   reconstruct  language  for  the purpose of  yielding something else  from  it.  If reality   is  contingent upon the language we use to bring  it into being,  where fact is the past  tense  of the fiction that   creates   it  (Haraway  1998:  69),  reworking language indeed  remakes the world. Arakawa and  Gins understand that  the language we use can become  too “habitual,”  what   Jondi   Keane   identifies  in  their   work   as  one   of  the   three “monorails of  homeostasis”  (2006: 161)  that   along   with   “agency” and “groundedness,” colonize  and  constrain conceptual and  corporeal (cognitive) possibility. Terminological junctions  such  as the  organism that  persons disrupt the  taken  for  granted phrases, “the  words of the  tribe”  (Lecercle  2006: 11) by hybridizing, twisting, counter-posing and  joining  contradictory terms  to agitate the   pre-determined,   colonizing  tendency   of   language  toward   reiterative, reductive ends.  It is precisely through such  destabilizations that  Arakawa and Gins re-program the category of not only the person, but also the world, thereby opening up  the  possibility for  it  to  become  an  undesignated ‘X’.  Importantly, they  do  not  in any  way  indicate what  this  ‘X’ is. They  allow  ‘X’ to emerge by taking    a   course   that   doesn’t    ‘arrive’   anywhere,  nor   produce  quantifiable
‘outcomes’  or  meet  key  performance ‘indicators’  - the  Death Sentence (2003) of
‘management speak’. What  Arakawa and  Gins seek to do via the reconstruction of language is produce a new  kind  of subjectivity, possibly a multiplicity, whose ontological being is generated, first and foremost, in its linguistic interaction with (giving  and  receiving) the  world. How  Arakawa and  Gins  propose to orientate, steer  or  guide that  newfound subjectivity/multiplicity  as  an  anti-teleological, open  ended process  toward an undesignated ‘X’, is through a similar  reworking of the components, steps  or moments of ontological experience they interpret epistemologically as “landing sites.”
