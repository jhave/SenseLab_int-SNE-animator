Gins   and   Arakawa  use   landing  site   configurations  as   the   basis   for   the construction of their  tactically-posed architectural surrounds.  Yet landing sites also operate independently of having to have a tailor-made, tactically-posed architectural surround to  bring  them  into  being.  They  are  indeed everywhere, constituting the everyday lived  contingencies of our most  rudimentary and  basic operations. As Gins and  Arakawa suggest, independent of a tactically  posed architecture to bring  them  into being,  “A landing-site configuration can, then,  be thought of as a heuristic device  with  which  to leaf through the  universe, never mind that is unpaginated” (2002: 9).
