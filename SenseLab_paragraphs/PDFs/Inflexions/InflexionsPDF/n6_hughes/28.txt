For Arakawa and  Gins it is integral that  the organism that  persons is constantly at the ready to shift, mutate and or reconfigure to the changing coordinates of the environmental  surround  to   which   it  is  subject.   In  an   Arakawa  and   Gins tactically-posed environment, the  active,  forever  at the  ready body,  cannot  help but  be  such  as  it  is  subjected  to  a  series  of  kinaesthetic, tactile,  visual,   oral, olfactory,  and   gustatorial  cues   embedded  in  the   walls,   floors   and   ceiling. Contrary to this,  what  I am seeking  to explore  is how  landing sites operate as a heuristic device  for understanding the  world as it is. It is through the  heuristic instruction of  landing site  awareness that  we  are  delivered the  ability   to  be cognizant in a variety of ways  of the  what,  why  and  how  we do  what  we do  – and  this  is the  first  step  in  shifting the  habits  through which  we,  conversely,
‘tactically engage’ our  built  environment. The best place  to begin  to understand how this can happen is through an examination of what  constitutes ‘architectural surround’.
