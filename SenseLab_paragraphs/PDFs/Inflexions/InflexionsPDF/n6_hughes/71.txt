Using  synthetic biology  the  self becomes  molecularly deregulated, yet  remains inextricably connected to the co-extensive process  of biological  construction that
‘extends’ in all directions everywhere. The deregulation of the synthetic organism that persons is I believe  the  most  qualified person for the  job of future creation, both   of  itself  and  necessarily  the  species,   precisely  because  its  idiosyncratic interface with  the  world is the  essential ingredient necessary for the  cultivation of difference, diversity and  complexity, which  cybernetic information theory tells are the antidotes to entropic decay  (Hayles  1999: 78). As biological  artist  Eduardo Kac  suggests, it  is  our  duty as  artists   (crisis  ethicists)   to  “…  increase   global biodiversity by  inventing new  life forms”  (2008: 1). Using  Arakawa and  Gins’ heuristic procedures, the construction of subjectivity implicit  in DIY synthetic biology,  can  occur  not  as a teleological destiny to be fulfilled  but  a moment to moment,  anti-teleological  process   of  ‘daily’   experimentation  and   discovery without end,  where information can  become  language can  become  discourse - and maybe  even poetry.
