Until  a significant number of tactically  posed surrounds are in use, the  architectural body  we  hypothesize to  exist  cannot   but  make itself scarce. It will be hard to come by except  as a heuristic device. Architectural bodies  do exist outright in surroundings that  are not tactically  posed. (Gins and Arakawa, 2002: 64)
