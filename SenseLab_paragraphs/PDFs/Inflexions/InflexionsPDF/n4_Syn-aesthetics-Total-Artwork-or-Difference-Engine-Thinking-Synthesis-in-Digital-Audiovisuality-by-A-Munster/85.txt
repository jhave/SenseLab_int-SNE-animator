Deleuze briefly  writes  about  the difference between analogue and  digital synthesizers, arguing that  whereas analogue synthesizers are  ‘modular’,  digital synthesizers are ‘integral’ (See Gilles Deleuze, Francis Bacon: The Logic of Sensation London: Continuum, 2003, 116).  What  is integral about  the digital synthesizer is the way  in which  it integrates all operations upon sound and  by sound, making it pass  through binary codification. I do not think  Deleuze’s distinction between the  two  kinds  of  synthesizers actually holds  historically as  it  is  the  analogue voltage controlled synthesizer that  introduces a ‘control’ line operation upon its modules.  Likewise,  digital synthesizers use a modular design. It is the case that a  cybernetic  model  of  codification  is  at  work   in  both   the  analogue  voltage controlled synthesizers and  early digital synthesizers. This is what  I have  tried  to indicate in this  essay.   Deleuze further argues in this  text  that  it is modulation (which  can be seen  in the  example of the  subtractive synthesis of frequencies in analogue synthesizers) that  characterizes the  analogue.   It should however be noted that  in a much  later  text, Deleuze argues that  modulation is characteristic of control societies,  which  characteristically are also codified digitally.  I think  he later  sees  that  it is not  the  digital nor  analogue per  se that  are  at stake  but  the question of the  command-control model that  is immanent to the  logic  of first- order  cybernetics (See  Gilles  Deleuze, ‘Postscript  on  the  Societies  of  Control’ OCTOBER 59, Winter  1992: 3-7).  My thanks to Troy Rhoades for directing me to Deleuze’s remarks on analogue and digital synthesizers.
