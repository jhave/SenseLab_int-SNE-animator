versa),  Kurokawa’s work  is frequently described in synaesthetic terms  (Neissen,
2006).  While operating as separate modes, the aural  and  visual  aspects of the work appear to  persistently elicit  each  other  so  as  to  produce a  ‘synthesis’  of  visual listening or aural  visuality.  In a video  Kurokawa directed for electronic musician ditch’s  track  ‘mysterious  hoze’  we  sense  this  solicitation.7     But  it  is  not  one  in which   audio and   visual   modalities  dissolve in  an  apotheosis of  transparency. Instead the  emphasis on  the  choreographic force  and  relation of audio to  video signal  creates  an animated sculpture unfolding temporally.  As if an electronic materiality, a cross-woven signal  arising out  of the  interplay of sonic  and  visual forces,  were  also  giving  us  a time  of the  electronic event.    A kind  of time-image digital signal – a ‘heautonomous’ cross-processing.8
