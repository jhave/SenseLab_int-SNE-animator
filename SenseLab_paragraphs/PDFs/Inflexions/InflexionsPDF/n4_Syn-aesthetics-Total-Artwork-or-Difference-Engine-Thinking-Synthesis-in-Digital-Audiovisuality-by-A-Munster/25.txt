patterns and  processes of signal  generated in and  out of code, passing in and  out of electronic materialities.  The error  launches a bank of signal  flows, which  mesh and  self-organize resolving themselves compositionally in their resultant auto and allopoetic processes.   A  digital ecology  temporarily forms  â€“ the  installation telefunken, consisting of cross-processed audio (CD) and  image  (televisual) signal that   rests   upon  the   mistaken  synthetic  conjunction  of  media  players.  Here synthesis is not so much  a unitary ground as a processual meshwork.
