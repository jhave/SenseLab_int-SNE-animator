Perhaps…and yet  meta-data is also  simply data  about  data.11    Or,  put  another way,  data  exerting a singularly informatic force  upon other  data  – in-forming data  about  data.   This ‘other data’  can likewise become  meta-data and  so on. In fact,  this  does   happen in  a  cross-signal programming  environment  when  a number of parameters (or ‘patches’, which  are small  and  discrete code modules) all wrangle for their  place  in a sequence of programming events.   It is often  not clear  in  a live  audiovisual  cross-signal processing situation what  signal,  what data  is telling  what  other  data  what  to do.   Setting  up  a number of sequential patches can  nonetheless result   in  recursions that   cause   or  stall  the  working together of data,  resulting in ‘erroneous’ or unexpected interactions and  the invention  of   new   image-images,  image-sounds,  sound-sounds   and   sound- images.   Signal’s micro-movement becomes  compositional and  not necessarily at the hands of the subject position of the composer/artist.  From an array  of micro- passes,  signal  flutters, stutters and  modifies signal.   As Whitelaw suggests, signal in   cross-processed  audiovisual   aesthetic  ‘objects’   is   not   a   case   of   simple transmission of information from A to B:
