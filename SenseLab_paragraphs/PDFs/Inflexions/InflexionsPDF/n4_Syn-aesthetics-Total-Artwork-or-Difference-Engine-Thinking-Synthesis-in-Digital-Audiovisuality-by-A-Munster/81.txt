5  I am  here  referring to  Western art  theoretical debates of late  modernism in which  Michael  Fried positioned Minimalism as a new art ‘position’ to break  with both  representationalist and  modernist/medium-specific  concerns especially as evidenced in mid-twentieth century painting. For Fried, Minimalist sculpture, in particular, was concerned with  the wholeness and  indivisibility of the object (See Michael   Fried   ‘Art  and   Objecthood’,  Art  and  Objecthood: Essays  and  Reviews, Chicago:  University of Chicago  Press,  1998, 148–172).   In turn,  this  issue  about the objecthood of the Minimalist work  of art was also countered and  debated by the  equally strong Conceptual Art  movement of  the  1950s  and   1960s.    Lucy Lippard’s Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object (Berkley  and  LA: University of California Press,  1997) remains a key text in this debate, where she politicizes the  assertion of objecthood  in Minimalism and  (white,  middle class, chiefly male) American art criticism  of the period.
