Kurokawa  initially  builds  a   synchronicity  between  the   techno   beat   of   the soundtrack and  the rhythms of the drawn blobs and  shapes that  pro-  and  contract in the  screen  space.   The visuals seem  to directly emerge and  take  form  from  the persistent beat  of  the  dance  track.    But  one  minute and  forty  seconds into  the sound, the  visual  drops off and  out  of time  with  the  beat  to become  a quivering and  tentative ring.   Momentarily it lacks any pulsation driving its form-ation.  We shift  gears  away  from  the  synchronous unity  of audio and  visual  modes to their disjunction, the departure of their  edges  from each other.  Our aural  attention shifts elsewhere within the  driving techno-unity of  the  track  to  hear  the  understated entry  of a jazz-inflected guitar riff.  Would we hear this variation as anything other than  simply melodic if an electronic heautonomous synaesthetics had  not entered the  mix?   Perhaps an informed listener would be able to discern the  multifarious universes of reference that  always inflect  contemporary  electronic dance  music. But what  Kurokawa brings  visually to the sonic pulse  here is a departure from the inevitability of beat,  which  might  dominate if the  visuals simply reinforced the rhythm.   Instead the  audio signalâ€™s  intervals open  up  by  generating a flickering relation  with    the   image.    The   ear   is   visually  oriented  towards   the   sonic differentiation held virtually by the music.9
