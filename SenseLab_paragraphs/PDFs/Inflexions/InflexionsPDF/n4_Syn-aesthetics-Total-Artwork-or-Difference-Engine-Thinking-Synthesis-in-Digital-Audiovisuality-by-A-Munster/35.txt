The NS hypothesis – more  recent  and  supported by neurologists such  as Baron- Cohen  (1997), Maurer (1997) and  Ramachandran and  Hubbard (2001) – asserts, instead, that  synaesthesia is a primary and  originary state  of infantile perception rather  than   cognition.    Up  until   about   the  age  of  4  months,  the  ’state’  of organization of the  infant’s brain  does  not  differentiate sensory input.  Instead, the NS hypothesis claims,  the neural architecture is cross-modal or ‘cross-wired’. Neurological development  from  this  period on,  then,   initiates the  process of
‘normal’ differentiation into separate sensory modalities. Some human brains  do not  fully  differentiate, leaving original ‘cross-modal’  pathways active.  In  these cases,  adult synaesthesia will  persist and  a person may  experience the  typical
’symptoms’ of involuntary call-up  of colours  in conjunction with  hearing certain
