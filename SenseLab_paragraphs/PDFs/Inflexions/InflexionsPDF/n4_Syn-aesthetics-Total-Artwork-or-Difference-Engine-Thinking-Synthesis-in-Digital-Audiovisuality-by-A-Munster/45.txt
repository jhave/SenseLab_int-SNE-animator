Deleuze and  Guattari posit  the difference between Romantic and  modern (contemporary) thought as a difference in approach to the  question of synthesis (1988: 342–3).

Modern/contemporary  philosophy should elaborate  thought’s   materiality  in   order  to  harness  forces   that   are   not   in themselves thinkable.  Thought brought into relation by thinking, and  by the thinking  of  thought  with   what   is  outside  of  itself;  likewise  for modern/contemporary  visual  sonic  art/music.
