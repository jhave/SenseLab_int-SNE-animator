Yet it is not just that  the synaesthetic and  the digital converge here.  The process of audiovisual synthesis taking  place in the installation is drawn into an epistemological and  ontological space of the Kantian ‘a priori’.  This seems  to me to  be  architecturally problematic – a  problem for  the  space  digital aesthetics wants to compose. Accorded the status of a structural architecture, which  would condition the  space  of perception-experience, synthesis occupies a similar  place as the Gesamtkunstwerk.  Must  it?  More on this later for indeed there  may just be another  way   to  think   the  ‘meta’  in  meta-synthesis.    In  the  meantime,  it  is worthwhile staying with  this  twisting of the  neural and  the  digital together via more  recent   work   on  synaesthesia in  both  the  perceptual  (neurological) and aesthetic (cross-processing of digital signal in contemporary audiovisual art).
