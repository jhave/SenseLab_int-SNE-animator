‘nineties’  of the  twentieth century, in the  hyped up  digital rendering of virtual reality.2  Indeed Wagner has been very much  at home  in emergent digital culture and  has  been  invoked genealogically in order to theorize the  origins  and  future of multimedia in Randall Packer  and  Ken  Jordan’s  Multimedia:  From Wagner to Virtual Reality (2001).  Multimedia, too, would offer the dream of total experience (albeit   upon  the   rather  constrained  stage   of   the   computer  desktop),  by synthesizing the various elements of audio, visual,  text and  graphic files together with   interactive  gesture,  all  via  the   orchestration  of  digital  code.     Wagner becomes   the  genesis   of  a  particular imaginary for  the  way  digital code  will operate,  not   only   aesthetically  but   also   as   digital  worldview.     The   total Wagnerian or multimedia artwork involves a practice of fusing  all aspects of the aesthetic (or all sensory modalities) under the aegis of a kind  of ‘meta-form’.  As Packer  and  Jordan  see  it, opera  was  Wagner’s  totalizing meta-form;  the  meta- form  of  the  digital is  the  interactive interface in  which  call-response gestures literally orchestrate the fusing  of all sensorial varying media (2001: xvii-iii).
