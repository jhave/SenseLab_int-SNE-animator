According  to  Deleuze  and   Guattari,  Kant’s  synthesis  occurs   as  a  cognitive response to sensory information. It is the organizing capacity of cognition, which accords  this  sensory information ‘form’ as mental representation.  But it would be  a  mistake,  they   suggest,  to  similarly  accord   the  synthesizer  –  that   mid- twentieth  century musical invention –  such  an  a  priori   function. It  does  not organize and   re-present its  various data   inputs from  some  a  priori   space  of
‘code’.     Rather   it  allows   the   differing  inputs  (sensory  elements)  to   form relationally via  their  various sonorous forces;  that  is, the  attack  and  decay  of a note or sequence of notes might  be isolated, tweaked and  used  recursively or as a force upon another input.  The synthesizer is not,  then,  a meta-apparatus, in the sense of being  a transcendent organizer of sonic elements into form (either reproducing an individual sound or formally producing ‘music’). Rather  the synthesizer is  a  new  kind  of  instrumental  assemblage: one  comprised of  the dynamics between sonorous and  nonsonorous elements;  sonic  and  infra-sonic
