Cross-signal processing of digital signal  –  for example, the  use  of digital sonic signal  to trigger, produce and modulate transformations and  formations of visual signal  in  practices such  as  VJing  – is an  area  that  has  already attracted some attention as an example of a different kind  of syn-aesthetics.  Mitchell  Whitelaw has   argued  that    the   transcoding  of   sound  and    image    in   the   work    of contemporary  Australian  artists    Robyn   Fox   and   Andrew  Gadow  can   be understood in terms  of cross-modal binding (Whitelaw, 2008: 259–276).  Here  the sound-image produced  in  these   digital  audiovisual  environments  might   be thought as  a cross-modal ’object’,  which  both  points to  the  underlying digital signal  and  to a domain of correlation between modalities.  Correlations (co- relations) Whitelaw suggests  are  part   and   parcel   of  perceptual  experience – edges  and  limits in a given  perception that suddenly make  it shift from sensation to meaning.  Sher  Doruff  has  also  suggested that  neural synaesthesia does  not need  to function as ground for the  digital and,  we can add,  nor  should ‘signal’ across  wires  legitimate the  neurology of synaesthesia (2007).   Instead, she  puts forward the  idea  of a transdisciplinary synaesthetic practice.  A practice of inter- composing  bodies,   signals,   machines  where  sensory  modalities  are   not   the starting points of relation and  fusion  is not  the  necessary outcome of their  co- mingling.    Instead,  an  image-sound  sensed is  a  contraction  of  the  practice, emerging   out    of   the   resonances   set   off   by   digital   aesthetic  generative architectures for  sound,  gesture, proprioception, image,   electronic signal   etc. Mark Amerika puts  it another way, suggesting that VJing as a lifestyle  practice of writing  the   image   into   existence   involves  processing  (or   transferring)  the energies of sensation and perception before we cognitively organize them:
