We   should,  then,    think    carefully  about    the   interrelations  of   the   digital synthesizerâ€™s architecture, its relation to its own analogue voltage-controlled predecessor and  to its milieu  of information theory and  culture.  Specifically,  it is to   the   particular  culture  of  military  research  and   development  in   digital computation that  holds  the  key  as to what  happens to  synthesis in  the  digital synthesizer.  Paul  Edwards has carefully outlined a setting in place  of a triangle of command, communication and  control  governing the socio-technical ensemble
