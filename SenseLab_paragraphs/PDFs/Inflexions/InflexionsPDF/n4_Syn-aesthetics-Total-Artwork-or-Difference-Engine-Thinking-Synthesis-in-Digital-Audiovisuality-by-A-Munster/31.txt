When   it   investigates  the   cause   of   actual   synaesthetic  experience  (that   is, involuntary   consistent  perceptions   of   colours    with    sounds  and    so   on), neuroscience  deploys  concepts  such   as  ‘cross-wiring’  in  the  brain (Ramachandran  and   Hubbard,  2001:  8–12).     Signal   carried  through  wires becomes  the founding architecture upon which  sensory experience is etched. As if micro-processes and  micro-processing could  be generated from similar  electric- architectural unities.
