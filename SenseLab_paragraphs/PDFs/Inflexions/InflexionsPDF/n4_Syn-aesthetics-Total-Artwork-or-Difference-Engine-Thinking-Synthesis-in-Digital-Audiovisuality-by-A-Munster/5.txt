But it is not  until  I enter  the immersive and  darkened space  of the screen-based installation housing the art collective  AES+F’s Last Riot, that  I really  feel chilled.1
Not   chilled    out,   in   the   way   that    a   mesmerising  audiovisual   sculptural
performance at a festival  or nightclub chills you into a different perceptual zone. Rather,  I am chilled  to the bone.  The moving images  in Last Riot fill three  screens and  270 degrees of  wall  space  with  synthetically generated  3D  backgrounds, objects and  incredibly beautiful, young airbrushed models from a range  of ethnic origins.   Uncannily though every  model looks the same.   This vision  is achieved via  a fantastic combination of art  direction, choreography and  post-production imaging techniques blanching out  any  bodily  difference.  The models bend  and contort across the computer-modelled landscape, which  feels vaguely Nordic, possibly  Siberian,    and   definitely  post-apocalyptic.     Cold,   icy   cold.      The soundtrack, leaving no doubt as to the ethos  meticulously invoked, is borrowed from Richard Wagner’s 1836 opera  The Flying Dutchman.
