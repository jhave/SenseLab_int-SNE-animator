Or  is  it?    Something riotous has  been  going  on  in  the  digital and  electronic audiovisual domain over  the past  decade.  Carsten Nicolai’s work  across  sound, vision,   signal,   noise   and   the   ecologies   of  these   provides  different  working methods and  processes for  synthesis and  syn-aesthetics.   In  telefunken  (2000), digital ‘signal’  criss-crosses media  players:  instead of  an  image  signal  from  a video  player, a CD player is hooked up  to a television monitor.  Audio tracks playing on  a CD in a gallery  space  visually generate the  movement, pulse  and pace of white  lines across television monitors.  Nicolai  calls this connection of CD to TV ‘erroneous’, giving  us an insight into something else at work  in digital syn- aesthetics (2002:78).   For Nicolai,  digital signal  does  not  simply flow  from  one machine to  another.   Rather,   the  idea  is  to  see  what   happens if  an  error  in connectivity occurs.   This is not simply the error  as it appears in avant-garde art making in, for example, the  Dadaist movement. It is the  error  as a fundamental problem encountered in  the  digital milieu  – a milieu  comprised of the  forces,
