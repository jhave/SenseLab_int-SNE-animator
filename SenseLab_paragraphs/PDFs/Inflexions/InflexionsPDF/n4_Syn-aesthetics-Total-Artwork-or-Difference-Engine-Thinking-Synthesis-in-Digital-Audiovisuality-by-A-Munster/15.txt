The problem is truly  a musical one, technically musical, and  all the more  political  for that.  The romantic hero, the voice of the romantic hero,  acts as a subject,  a subjectified individual with  “feelings” but this subjective vocal element is reflected in an orchestral and instrumental whole  that  on the contrary mobilizes nonsubjective “affects”  and  that  reaches  its height in romanticism (Deleuze and Guattari, 1988: 341).
