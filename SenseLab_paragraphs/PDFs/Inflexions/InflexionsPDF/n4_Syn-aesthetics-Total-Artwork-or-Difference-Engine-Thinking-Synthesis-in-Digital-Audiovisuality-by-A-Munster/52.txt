The  sticking   point   is  the  digital.    Deleuze  and   Guattari’s  ‘discovery’  of  the asignifying semiosis of the synthesizer arrives right  on the cusp  of the release  of the digital synthesizer into the music  market. Quite  apart from where it ends  up, unsurprisingly, in the  New  Romantic melodies of Duran Duran, Ultravox and Boy George  during the 1980s, the synthesizer becomes  an instrument for solving what  is both  a technical and  political  problem.  This is already occurring during the   1960s  but   is  not   quite   apparent  at  the   level   of  musical  and   aesthetic production during that  period.  Most synthesizers in the 1960s and  even up until the  late  1970s  are  still  large,  customized and  sit  in  a  number of  avant-garde recording  studios  such   as  those   of  the   Cologne  Recording  Studio   used   by composers such  as Stockhausen.6   Indeed, it is quite  possible that  by solving  the problem in the  specific  way  that  it was  solved,  digital synthesis is able to rejoin its old neighbour, the synthetic a priori.
