9  I am  making something of an assumption in my  analysis of this  video.  From what   I  know   of  the  way   in  which   Kurokawa  works   (gleaned  from   online interviews  and   watching  documentation  of  his  performances),  he  uses   both audio and  video  signal  in conjunction with  each other  as generative forces upon each other.   So, for example, he may  produce an audio track,  which  he will then use  to cross-process video  material.  He  might  also  then  take  this  material and feed  it back  to  affect  the  audio signal.    My  assumption in  the  analysis of this music  video  is that  given  he has been  provided with  the audio by another artist, he would have  used  the audio signal  generatively to produce the pulses and intensities we  find  in  the  visuals.   For  further information about   Kurokawa’s working methods, see Kurokawa, Rioyichi and  Bertram Niesson, ‘Rioyichi Kurokawa: Perspective and  Nature [Interview]’, Digimag 17 (September 2006), http://www.digicult.it/digimag/article.asp?id=627.
