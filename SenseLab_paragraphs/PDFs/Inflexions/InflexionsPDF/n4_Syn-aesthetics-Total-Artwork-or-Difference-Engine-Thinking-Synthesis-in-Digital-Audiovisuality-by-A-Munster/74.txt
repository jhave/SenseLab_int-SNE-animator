It seems,  then,  that  in these  types  of signal  cross-processing events  we revisit  the analogue voltage-controlled synthesizer where continuous variables or flux patterns between voltage and  sonorities contract into emergent sonic sensations. But  we  have  shifted design away   from  a  separate control   line  –the  voltage- controlled synthesizer’s command-control cybernetic heritage. Instead the  ways in  which   audiovisual  artists   and   VJs  are  using   in  digital  cross-processing, modules are  constantly shifting around,  never   acquiring ground,  in  fact.    In cross-signal processing  audiovisual  events,   especially  in  live  and   somewhat aleatory circumstances, digital synthesis loses its tendency toward the synthetic a priori.   Sensation that  finds  lines of expression through cross-signal processing is no  longer   causal   nor   is  it  a  fixed   phenomenon.  Rather   it  becomes   visual sonification, sonic visualization, diagramming a resonating, moving architecture. Not  structural but  relational.  Not  synthesized but  conjunctive.   Something that builds rather than  is built.   A digital syn-aesthetics finding its compositionality in analogue mode.
