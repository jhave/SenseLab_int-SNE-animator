in  the  emergence  of  digital  computation  during  the  post-   WWII  period  of American  military  research.   Digitality itself  is  not  an  obvious  or  necessary process here  but  is sought after  because it delivers a certain  militarily ordered zeitgeist that  he describes as a rationally controlled ‘closed world’ (1996: 43-73). All elements of computational hardware, software, interface and  system design come to us out of this socio-technical ensemble that  has been and  continues to be military research into  information. Including the digital synthesizer.  This is not to say that  the analogue synthesizer’s components are not,  too, adjuncts of what was once military electronic research.  But the crucial  difference lies with  an architecture that  re-places the force-materiality relation, still possible even  in the voltage controlled synthesizer, with  that of a form-matter relation, in which instructions are to be carried out upon sounds.  In which  sonorous matter is synthesized a priori  out of the control  line code.
