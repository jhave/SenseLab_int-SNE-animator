television set.   With this simple  gesture, the television is utterly transformed and  reinvented: the privileged outlet  of commercial culture and  information-overload suddenly becomes  a blank  slate for the  presentation of abstract minimalist art…To  speak  like Kant or Heidegger, one might  say that  ‘telefunken’ calls our  attention to the   transcendental  field   of   the   television,  the   conditions  of possibility for any given  image  or content. In place  of the ordinary empirical content of television – the endless flow of images  and representations  –  ‘telefunken’  gives   us  simply  electrons, pixels, light, line, and frame (Cox, 2002: 15–16).
