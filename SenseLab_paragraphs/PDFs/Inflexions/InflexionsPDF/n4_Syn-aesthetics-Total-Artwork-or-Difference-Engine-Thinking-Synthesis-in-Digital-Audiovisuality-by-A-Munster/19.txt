What kind  of conceptual space, what  conceiving of space for thought, can arise in the middle of engaging with  such  synthetic art?   How  might  the multi-sensorial experience  become   something  other,   where  the   elements  of  sound,  colour, gesture and  so  forth  are  given  lines  that  sometimes exchange, meld  and  yet nonetheless depart from  each  other  in order to open  up  new  worlds of the  felt? And  in the feeling,  of thought?  How  might  synthesizing continue to open  up  a space  in which  thought runs  off along  these  lines  as well,  becoming eccentric, wild  and  fleeing?    Thought, that  is, about  the  exchange of sensations but  also cognition generated in the  very  action  of sensory exchange.  Must  the  synthesis of heterogeneous elements – an  operatic overture, cold  colour  palettes, a dark overwhelming space – collapse  into a totalized digital world?  A world, which  is an immersive stage, upon which  not the future artwork but the future of warfare is instead rehearsed and performed? What room  in this to conceive-imagine how aesthetics and  the  cosmologies, toward which  it gestures, might  synthesize differently?
