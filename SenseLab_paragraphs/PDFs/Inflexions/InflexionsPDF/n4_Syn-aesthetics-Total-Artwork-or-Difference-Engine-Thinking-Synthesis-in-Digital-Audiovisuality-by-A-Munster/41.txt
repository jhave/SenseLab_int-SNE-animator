Now,  this  relational sensory perception-architecture does  not  ‘solve’ the neurological question  of  synaesthesia  in  terms   of  accounting  for  its neurobiological causes.4    But it does provide a kind  of plasticity for thinking synaesthesia as process that  both  coheres  and  differentiates and  which  takes  us away  from  the  metaphor of  ‘hard  wiring’  that  traverses both  the  neural and digital accounts of the synaesthetic. Perhaps the issue is the kind  of architectures we use to think  and  make  neurological and digital relations. Synaesthesia as both neurological condition and  as digital aesthetic experience, then,  needs  to be unthought as  a  unified architecture of  passages or  pathways for  signal  flow. Perhaps it might  then  be thought anew  as a relational architecture as Massumi has  suggested  (2002:  191–2).    Here   synthesis  of  image   and   sound,  such   as happens in  the  midst of  a  particularly  freewheeling VJing  set,  composes an emergent syn-aesthetics recursively drawing  upon  and   refreshing  a  field  of varied continuities of lines of sensory expression that  fan out  between artist,  art and  audience:
