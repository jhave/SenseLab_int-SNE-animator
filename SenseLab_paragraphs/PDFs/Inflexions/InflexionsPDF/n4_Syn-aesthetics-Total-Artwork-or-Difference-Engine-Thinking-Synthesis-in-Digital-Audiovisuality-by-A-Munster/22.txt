Last Riot  consciously details the  ways  in  which  the  passages between compositional elements amidst the  arts  and  between the  artwork and  public space   –  the  space   of  bodies   in  public   congregating,  moving,  relating  –  are subsumed by a post-Wagnerian meta-synthesis.   This is a syn-aesthetics of transparency, senseless flows,  seamlessness. But Last Riot does  not  offer  us any alternate passages for other  aesthetico-political movement(s). It is an apocalyptic, epic hymn to the digital cooling  of the senses.   It leaves  us cold as each  sensory bloc is poured into another effortlessly; as we stand still, and  without moving us. It is the senses’ last riot.
