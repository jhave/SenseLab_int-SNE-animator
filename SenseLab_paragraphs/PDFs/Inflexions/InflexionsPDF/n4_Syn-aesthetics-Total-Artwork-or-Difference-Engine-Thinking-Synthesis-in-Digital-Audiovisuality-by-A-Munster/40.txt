Perception  in  a  living   being,   following  Simondon,  might   be  thought  as  a mediating process that  is both  a bringing together but,  in this  very  conjoining, individuates.   Perception conjoins  the  human’s  sensory potentialities with  its milieu,  brings  to it a world to which  it is already parametrically tuned. Humans, for example, cannot see ‘infrared’  in the  colour  spectrum and  can  usually hear between 20 and  20,000 Hz.   Perception thus  depends upon a ‘pre-individuated’ set of human potentialities and  limitations.  But this bringing-into-relation of the human organism with  a milieu  is itself  already relational and  processual.  This bringing-into-relation is the very work  of perception as it actively  adapts the relational architecture of the  sensory-motor apparatus.   This apparatus is less a machine  or  even   system  and   more   an  internal  resonance –  an  infolding  of resonances  that   have   meta-stabilized.  In  a  human  (and   many   other   living organisms) this resonance is the sensorium as individuating continuum  – a modulating relationality of all 5, 6, 7 or more  of the senses  to each other.   This is what  Brian Massumi has called the senses’ already existing  ‘perfusion’, the intersensing or  co-attraction of the  senses  as  ‘almost’  there,  a virtuality (2002:
156–7).    This  must   always already  have  been  the  senses’  relational mode   of existing   in  order for  them   to  individuate  (and   which   was   itself  already an individuation and the ‘pre-individual’ of the senses  as plurality).
