As VJ, Mark Amerika alludes here to both mesh  and  potentiality as simultaneous pauses in the synaesthesia of contemporary audiovisual digital experience. If we are to deploy a digital syn-aesthetics, we must  be willing  to allow  both  the ‘syn’ and   the   ‘aesthesia’  resonant  activities  and   architectures.  But  this   may   also necessitate giving  up  the idea  of the artwork as total  experience, where it seems to  have  shifted since  losing  its  objecthood.5     New  subjectivations  must  follow from  this – not only for ‘the artist’, ‘the viewer’ but  also for ‘art’. I will return to this   when  I  attempt  to   understand  current  artistic   experiments  in   cross- processing  digital  signal   syn-aesthetically.    What   I  want   to  suggest  is  that similarly   we   cannot  approach   the   digital   as   exemplary  of   synaesthetic experience, if by this we mean  that  interfacing with  digital art presents us with  a totality of sensory engagement.
