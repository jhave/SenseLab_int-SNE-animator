It is the parametric operation of the synthesizer that uses one force – for example, the force of a wave  being pushed through different ranges of voltage frequency – against the force of another element of sonic matter, which  makes  the synthesizer a  relational  apparatus.    Synthesis thus   shifts  away   from  its  function  as  the unifying ground it held  in,  for  example, Kant’s  judgements,  toward a shifting terrain.  This terrain is always in the process of being  diagrammed as sonic and nonsonic  elements  consistently  relate   to  each  other   in  the  making  of  what Deleuze and  Guattari describe as a field of ‘generalized chromaticism’ (1988: 95).
