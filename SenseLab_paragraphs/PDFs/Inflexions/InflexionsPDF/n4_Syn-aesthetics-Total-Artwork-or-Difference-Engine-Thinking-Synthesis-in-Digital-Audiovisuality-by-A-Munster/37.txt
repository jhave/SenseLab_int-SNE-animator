In the CMT model, cognitive abstraction makes  sensory cross-modality possible; in  the   NS  model  complete  nondifferentiation  supports  movement  between sensory  pathways.    There   is  a  fundamental  symmetry,  then,   between  the competing  hypotheses  even   though  they   differ   as   to   the   developmental emergence  and   neuro-systemic  location   (cognition  vs.  perception)  of synaesthesia.    In  other   words,  at  the   heart   of  both   understandings  of  the synaesthetic lies the ‘ground’ of an originary unity  of the individual brain - either fundamentally perceptual or cognitive.  But it is precisely the unity  that  requires explanation.  For in fact what  we are seeking is an understanding precisely of the sensory, perceptual or cognitive activities of unification (or rather of joining)  by investigating synaesthesia in the first place.
