Benedikt ed, Cambridge, Massachussetts: MIT Press,  1991, pp.  363–382.  This kind  of article  espousing VR utopianism emphasised the  experiential transparency between computer- generated environments and  their  audiences, especially of a kind  of exchange between onscreen actors  and  avatars and  interactants.  The rhetoric of presence likewise  dominated  the   discussion  of  these   kinds   of  simulations  and   the interaction with  users or audiences.
