AB: For Pragmatic reasons.  Forays was  invited  to show in Grand Rapids.  I  was there and the plan was to do a new piece.   Jerry  and I  had a bunch of  ideas we were working with  and weren’t sure exactly what to do, and we decided to go with  the steam oven largely  because  Grand  Rapids  has  a really  extensive steam network or steam infrastructure which is pretty rare for American cities.   It runs  through all of downtown and heats buildings, but also restaurants use it for hot plates in the kitchen.   Sometimes, not all the time, but sometimes, the steam is  actually  generated in  Grand  Rapids  by burning  garbage.  So  the incinerator and the steam, the garbage incinerator,  and the steam are connected.  They put all this garbage in there and burn it, and the heat from the burning garbage boils  the water  and sends  the steam running  through  the whole  city.  But there are these certain low points in the steam network where water collects, and at these points the water gets shot out of the system and re-converted into steam when it hits the air.  That’s why  it's coming out of the ground.
