AB: Well, after we cooked stuff in the oven, we did a project about dumpstering. We  created an icon—these stickers that label edible trash or edible excess.   We would go out and put these stickers on sites where there was edible food  and we would put the stickers  there so  that the sites  were  identifiable  by foragers. And yeah, there were a whole bunch of things afterwards. But we’ve been in a state of wondering where our practice is at right now. But something that we’re working on now has  to do with  real-estate  but it’s a bit  too premature  to talk about.
