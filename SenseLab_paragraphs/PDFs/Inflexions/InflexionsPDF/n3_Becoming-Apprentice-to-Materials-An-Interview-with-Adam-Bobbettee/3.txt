I interviewed Adam Bobbette one night in June of  last year. At  the time, Adam had just  finished  working  as  curator  at the Canadian Centre  of Architecture [CCA] in Montr√©al. He also had just completed an artist residency  at Eyebeam in New York  City. I  wanted to talk  to him about his experiences there, what he was   producing   at  the  time, and  how  his   practice  as   artist,   curator,   and researcher converged and influenced one another.
