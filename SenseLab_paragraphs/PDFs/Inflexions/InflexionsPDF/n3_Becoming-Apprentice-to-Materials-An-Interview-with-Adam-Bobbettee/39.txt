The cocoons were for different purposes.  Initially, they were built for squatters in New York City  who were protecting community gardens that were going to be destroyed by  the city, and the cocoons made an easy way to get up and into tree-sits,  so that  if the city  was  going to demolish  a park somebody  with  a cocoon could  climb up into a tree, pull  it  out, sling  it up, and then you’re in  a tree and the city  can’t bulldoze anything because you’re in the tree. But it was also  used to sleep  in  construction  sites,  scaffolding  —  it  could  be used for anything.    And it could be made from  just  about anything.    It's really   a very flexible object.    The  materials  that we chose,  the sites  where  we  installed it, emerged from our own interests but in no way are meant to dictate any future iterations  of  the cocoons.    Tree  squatters  could  use them but also  someone might be more interested in the techniques of shoplifting, or putting on a harness and scaling  a building  or  a tree.   Someone  else might  use a different  material entirely, a tarp for instance.
