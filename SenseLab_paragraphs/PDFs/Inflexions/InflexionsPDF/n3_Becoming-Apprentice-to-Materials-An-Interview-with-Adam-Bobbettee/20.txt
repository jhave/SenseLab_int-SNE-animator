But if you want a continuation of the garbage theme, one of the projects I  did at Eyebeam was to harvest wild yeast from the air. I  built  these elaborate traps that I  would stick  on the roof  at Eyebeam in Chelsea.  Basically,  a condition is created inside these traps that lure  the yeast in (really it's just sweetened water) and the yeast gets in there, is activated, and starts to reproduce and turns  into an active yeast culture.  From  that yeast you can bake bread, which I  never ended up doing.  But the initial plan was to bake bread in a solar oven, also on the roof.   So it was this way of turning the air into bread using only the elements which  are  immediately  present,  which  was  a continuation  of  the theme of  my interest in garbage. How,  for instance, do you  work with materials close at hand and  how do you push those  materials in  such  a way as to actually  produce some kind of new condition or innovation.
