AB: I  was  writing my  thesis  [Adam did  his first MA at McGill  University  in  the Art History and Communications Department], and I was writing about trash housing in  the South  Western  USA, which then got me thinking  about garbage,  waste, and excess, generally. So I  started doing this work as a kind of "mode of investigation” not to make "art works.” That wasn’t really my concern.
