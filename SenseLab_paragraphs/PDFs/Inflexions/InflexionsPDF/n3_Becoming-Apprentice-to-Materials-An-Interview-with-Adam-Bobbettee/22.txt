AB: We  were  going  to work  with  steam  coming  out of  the ground  from  the network  of  the steam pipes  that heat a lot  of  Manhattan.   We  were going  to build this crazy mobile shadow theatre that was powered by the steam. Again, our proposal was to work with the elements that are immediately there.
