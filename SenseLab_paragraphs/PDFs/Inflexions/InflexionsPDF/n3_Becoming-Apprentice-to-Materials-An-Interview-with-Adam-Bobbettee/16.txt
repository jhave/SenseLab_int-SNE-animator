AB: I  started  working on my  own stuff  but I  also met  Jerry Juarez  and we had similar  interests.  So  we started  working together  and eventually started  talking about our projects as Forays.  Our work was really  more like experiments, and we were attracted  to amateur  naturalists  who would go on Sunday "forays"  with their  note  books, eyeglasses  and drawing  pads.  We  started  calling  our work Forays which was eventually turned into a group name by other people.  People love proper names.
