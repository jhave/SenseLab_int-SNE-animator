AB: Well, I mean New York City is fucked up and doing something like that in the park you   don’t get  people  wanting  to try  it  but you   do get people taking pictures;  people  feel  like  there is  something  “arty”  going  on, or  some kind  of event, so they’ll take out their  iPhones and snap a photo of it, and if they see it in the paper the next day they’ll be like “I was there.”  The intention behind it was to build it as a tool that can be spread to other people, and it was like “look, we found out this way to do this, we've used these methods, they are not perfect, but they open some exciting possibilities.”
