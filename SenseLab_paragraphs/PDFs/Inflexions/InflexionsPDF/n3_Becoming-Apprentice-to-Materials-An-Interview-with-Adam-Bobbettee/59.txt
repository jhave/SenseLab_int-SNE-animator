Lately, I  have been re-reading Robert Smithson and he is helping me a lot with the relation  between "artistic"  production  and  politics.  He  is turning  me much more to questions of  perception:  how we see,  hear,  feel,  taste and talk  about the  world,    how   are    these   material    processes    and   how  are    material arrangements always already political.   Distorting, re-arranging,  or undermining the material  processes  that produce  our  “sense  of  the world”  is  a deeply political process.   What I have been learning from Smithson, and which you find taken up by so  many others (including Deleuze and de Landa) is that politics is always enacted through perception.   It must allow  particular  kinds of  worlds to be sensible while  foreclosing others.   Here then, politics crosses the threshold of aesthetics.  And so what then might it be to practice on perception, what other kinds of worlds become perceptible?  I don’t know. Does that make any sense?
