AB: It  was  a continuation,  obviously,  of  these themes. The  hot dog  oven is basically a small oven, six by six inches square and two feet long, made of sheet metal and dryer tubing from home depot.  You connect it to a man hole cover where the steam is  coming  to the surface  and the oven simply  captures that steam  and in  it  you   can cook  basically  whatever  you   like.  I   did   it  in  Grand Rapids,  Michigan  for  a show  that   was   there,   and  I    did   it  as  part  of   a collaborative project with Jerry.  Jerry and I had cooked using steam before on this night that we camped in Manhattan on New Year’s Eve.  It was for this end of  the world project  that we did  and for which we had made a more basic prototype  of  the steam oven out of  the light  bulb  cages  used  on construction sites.   We  filled it in with foil and put a hot dog in it, then you dip  it into the cone (in Manhattan  they have these  cones that stick  up 8 or  9 feet  to keep  steam away from  street level so people don’t walk through and get burnt). So we had a rod, it was  almost  like a fishing  thing, and then we dipped it into the steam. The steam oven was a slightly more sophisticated  version than that but ran the steam directly from the ground into the oven. So I cooked hot dogs in it.  On  top of the oven there is a glass container that when a steam goes in it re-condenses on the top
of the container and then drips  back down as water into a cup.  And then you can make tea.
