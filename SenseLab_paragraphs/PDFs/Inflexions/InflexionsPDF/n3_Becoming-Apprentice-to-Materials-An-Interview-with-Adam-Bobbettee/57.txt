His  interest  was  not in  other  people  completing  his work  but in  how instructions  actually produce conditions  for unexpected insertions  of  originality, how the instruction  is  never carried  out exactly  as  described,  there are  always divergences and re-appropriations.  This is precisely how authorship is contested, through the little openings that allow for re-appropriation.
