AB:  Well,   the  cocoons   were   these  portable   sleeping   devices,   basically hammocks that were built out of stolen material, hacked from  construction sites. Jerry and I were talking about the re-purposing of infrastructures, like steam, and the re-purposing  of  materials.  And this  again, is also  related to de Landa‘s concept of  the becoming apprentice to materials, which  means  entering  into an experimental relationship  with  it. Also, we were into exploring  open-source architecture, or what it would mean to create open-source architecture. For us, that meant things like  hacking,  stealing,  and thieving,  breaking  and entering— basically, transgressing notions of private property and real estate. The cocoons were  made out of  a bunch of  materials  through  different  iterations.    One of them was postal envelopes, which you can get for free from post offices in the US and they’re made out of Tyvek.   Tyvek is really  an amazing material, and it’s generally  really  expensive. The postal  envelopes are free and you can go and take however much you want.  Jerry would go and take piles and piles of these envelopes and we would open them up and flatten  them out and sew them together. Jerry  was  also  making  dresses  out of  them and we made a cocoon out of them. So a cocoon is a one person sleeping arrangement that can hang from  basically anywhere and that will hold your  weight. We used Tyvek, but also construction netting, which is what they put on scaffolding on construction sites to keep  the dust down. We  would just  climb  into  the scaffolding  at night and hack out a chunk.  We also made them out of one dollar beach mats that you
