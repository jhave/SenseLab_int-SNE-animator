Forays  has  also  been interested  in  these basic  concerns.   I  think  that anybody who’s been involved in DIY culture for awhile has in a sense “grown up with”  a commitment to skill sharing and  mutual-aid models: showing someone how the fuck  you  did  something,  teaching  people how to get away with  stuff,  how to steal  stuff,  how to rip  stuff  off. You  spread  knowledge  because  we got it  from other people and we need this kind of  sharing  in  order  to help us find ways to get along  with  the lives  we want to live.    And this  is  precisely  the principle  of open-source.   But then there is this whole conflict when this methodology enters the art world. There is a conflict between the art world which stresses originality and novelty (which is precisely why  this kind of work — instruction based work— often ushered in under  the rubric of  “relationality”  is hip right  now, because it's novel)  and you end up with  situations  where you are  showing  instructions  on how to steal  something  and people  respond  by saying  “what  an interesting work of art”.  And you can’t necessarily reproduce it because if you are an artist you are demanded to make something that is “yours”,  “unique to you”.  So it's no longer  an environment  where these instructions  can actually  flow  around. But you know, what is striking about this is how all of these questions resonate so strongly  with  the instruction  based  conceptual  work  of  the 1970's  where  these same  tensions over  originality were  being  taken up.   Now   I  am realizing that punk rock culture and activist culture have been good friends with Sol Le Wit for a while now.
