can  get  in   any  Chinatown   shop,   and  they’re   plastic.   Because   we  were interested  in  pushing  materials  it  also  then turned us  to process.  We  started thinking about process  and less  about objects. Creating  an aesthetic  object— something that is pretty or appealing, or anything like that—stopped mattering. It was less interesting.  What did matter was where materials take you. Where do you go to find them? Who do you meet? What kinds of situations do you get in? You enter into this creative relationship with the infrastructure of the city. It takes you to places like post offices, constructions sites, abandoned buildings, or websites where people give stuff away. So Jerry ended up in these interactions with  people in  midtown,  talking with  crazy  old ladies  because  they’re  giving away  cotton  batting, tons  of  cotton batting,  so   she actually  enters  into  a relation with  somebody  that otherwise  she  never  would  by  virtue  of  trying to escape   a  commodity   relationship,  or   a  relationship  based  on  monetary exchange.   As we’re  thinking  more  and more  about process  and where the material  is  taking  us,  where are  we going  to find  the material,  we really  start orienting our  projects around that to the point that when we show projects we would  try  to even shrink  away  from   showing objects  and just  show process. When we showed the cocoon project  at Eyebeam,  we had the cocoons  but they were  rolled  up and mostly  hidden, otherwise  it  was  photographs  and a map of every step that we took to create them—every place we went to, every material we used,  the knots that we used  to tie  the ropes,  all that just to show that this is a process, and to open up that process to people.
