outside in — like a water pipe or a gas pipe—when the pipe is removed, a hole is left  in the brick.  It is really  common but it is never something that we pay any attention to.  Typically when we look at a wall we complete it, smooth it out, or fill in the holes.  So I inserted plexie tubes into the holes and inside the tube there would be lights or at the end there would be an image where there could be all sorts of  objects,  like kaleidoscopes for instance.   As you’re walking  you  see this little glow coming out of the wall and you  might go take a look  inside.  It's a very simple way of giving depth to something we might experience as a flat surface.
