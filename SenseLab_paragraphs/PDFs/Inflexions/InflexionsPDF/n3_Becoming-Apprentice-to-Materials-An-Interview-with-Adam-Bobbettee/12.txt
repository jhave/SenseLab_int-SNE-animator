AB: Yes,  somewhat on a whim  my  friend  Steve  Helsing  and I  decided to apply for the  residency.   Anything that I had done up to that point was always out on the street,  with other  people,  or  on walls  (I was doing  a lot  of  graffiti  then).  I'd never had an art show or really cared to, nor really cared to see them either— the world of art  was pretty distant and not appealing.  So without any officially recognizable experience I made up a bunch of “official shows”, which really just meant to account for  the stuff  we were  doing in  back  alleys and parks and what not. And we got the residency at Eyebeam. Then it was like, “I gotta make art”  (laughs).  I  don’t know how to make art,  I’ve  never  made art  before and then Steve  dropped out of  the project  and I  really  had to figure out how to make art now that I was working alone.
