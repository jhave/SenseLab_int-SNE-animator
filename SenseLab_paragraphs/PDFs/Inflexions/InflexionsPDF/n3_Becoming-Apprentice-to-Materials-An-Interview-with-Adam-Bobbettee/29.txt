This  has   informed   my   own  scepticism   towards   sustainability;   there  is  a re- emergence of  discourses  of  “crisis”  along  side  technological  triumphalism,  but what is actually  going to change,  or  what social  relations are  we  trying to maintain when we ask for technological  and infrastructural  change?  Finding cheaper  and renewable  sources  of  energy  so  that we can recharge  our cell phones,  drive  cars,  watch television,  and keep  buying  cheap stuff,  is  nothing interesting; it transforms infrastructural organization without touching social form. This is  why   Forays  has  been interested  in  the end of  the world,  as  a way  to imagine  and   live   through a  real  crisis   that  opens   up  the  possibility   of experimenting with social form.
