always subsidiary to politics, where the real action is.  Conversely, I also think that art  is  this  really  special  place  where you can  manipulate  certain  structures,  if you’re  smart  enough about  it,  to  make  certain  things   possible  which   are otherwise not.  And you can use your privilege as an artist to manipulate certain things.  Like the group Wochenklausur who used their  position as artists to create a mobile  health  clinic  for homeless  people  and street  workers  in  Vienna.  They use their  funding and resources as artists-in-residence to fill a need and a service that’s not being met by  the state. And their position is that people can call it art if  they want to, but they don't really  care  as  long  as  it  is  meeting  enough protocols of the art system to keep them receiving funding so they can do their projects; in that case, they'll continue to call themselves artists.   What they care about  is  using  their   positions   as  artists   to get  something   done  that won’t otherwise get done.
