[3] In Signéponge (1988) Jacques  Derrida works on the poet’s signature, avowing, “[j]’avance  lentement” (30), insisting that  he hopes  neither to tread to heavily  nor to echange one  signature, his  own,  through and  over  that  of Ponge.    He  must draw into  his words, like a sponge, the matter of the things  that  the poet  draws into  the  writing he  secretes  on  the  page.    As it might  be suggested below,  his encounter with  Pour un Malherbe and  La Fabrique du pré becomes  an event  of the order those which  Gins and Arakawa describe.
