When  Angela  and  Robert  bring  their  own  bodily  architecture into  the  landing site  of their  hosts  an event takes place. When  the  latter  encourage the  former to “prehend” the space  about  them  they  infer that  it is a given  “datum,” something prehended, that  itself is “a pre-existing or co-existing prehension such that  every prehension,” be it for the guests or anyone whosever, “is a prehension of prehension,” making the  event  a “nexus” of prehensions. Each new  prehension becomes  a datum. It becomes  public,  but  for other  prehensions that  objectify  it; the    event    is   inseparably   the    objectivation   of   one    prehension   and    the subjectivation  of another. It is at once  public  and  private, potential and  actual, entering into  the  becoming of another event  and  subject  of its own  becoming” (106). As if he were  reading Architectural Body, the  philosopher goes  on to note that  prehension offers  three  other  traits.  In its subjective form  it is “the  manner by which  the datum is expression in the subject,  or by which  the subject  actively prehends the  datum” (ibid.), through emotion, projection, evaluation, consciousness. It carries  feeling or manner and  moves  tentatively. Its subjective aim “assures the passage of one datum to another” in going  from one prehension to another in a sense  of becoming that  “puts the  past  into  a present filled  with [gros de] the future” (ibid.). The final phase come with satisfaction, self-enjoyment, “when prehension is filled with  its own  data” (107), or when the thought, say, of the snail enjoying its own future as it moves  ahead, is countenanced.
