A  tentative  constructing  toward a holding  in  place appears to  share   uncommon affinity  with  at least  two  related issues  that  bear  on  the  theory and  practice of space.  One,  belonging to  inherited axioms   of  cosmography and   topography, deals  with  the conundrum that  any  perception of a “whole” or of the place  that the world in which  we live occupies in the heavens cannot  be felt without a more immediate and  heightened sense  of somewhere here, local, without which  a containing (or in a theological context,  at once  an  originary and  a redemptive) matrix   cannot   be  discerned. When  Arakawa and   Gins  write   of  a  movement toward  a  “holding  in  place”   what   they   call  the  place   would  be  a  sort   of topographical umbilicus, the area  from  which  any  and  everyone of us feels that he or she has been separated or divided in order to be located  and  registered in a greater world.
