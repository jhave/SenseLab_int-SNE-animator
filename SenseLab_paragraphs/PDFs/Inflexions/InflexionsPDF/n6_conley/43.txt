The eye that  emerges from  the emblem becomes  its “secret,” indeed the secretion of a bodily  architecture far from the abstraction that  the surrounding text (in octosyllable, on the opposite folio) assigns to the image  of the snail. [4] When  the gastropod is seen  in “tentative” movement into  a world beyond itself it belongs to a construction in which  the immediacy of ocular  touch—if,  expanding on Paul Claudel’s formula, the “eye  listens” (l’oeil écoute), here  it could  be said  that  “the eye touches.” It touches on  the  decorated frame  of ornately drawn animal and vegetal  motifs  while  it take  part  in its own  enigma. It arches  forward but  also inward,  as  if  it  were   turning  within and   outside  of  itself  in  its  staging  of sentience.
