denies  or even must  disavow its own  sense of itself as being  “nowhere.” [1] As a first  point,  it can  be said  that  Arakawa and  Gins  build  on  a deeply embedded paradox in which  a growing sentience of space  and  place  gives  rise to perpetual doubt about  where one  is whenever and  wherever one  moves.  The  feeling  of being “here” that goes with  troping toward something “there” is discerned when architecture, that  is, what  is sense to be before and  about  our sentient faculties,  is already in the movement that  the gerund makes  clear: when  we are constructing toward a space  that  is located  by  its  architecture the  very  architecture is being built  within us, when building—always in the  gerundive—is happening within us.
