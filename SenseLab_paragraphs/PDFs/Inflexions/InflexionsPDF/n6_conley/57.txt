the  indication of somewhere here  and  somewhere there,  but  also  a  cleft  or  a crevice of the kind  they describe in a reflection on the nature of a line:  “As with a leaf,  it starts  with  a tentative, with  a rib,  which  splits  as  part  of its  means  of continuance and  then  splits  again  along  the  way  and,  in so doing,  sets  up  the pattern of enactment for all the subsequent drawing-throughs” (Gins 1994: 163). Given the context  of the gastropod, the emblem and  factotum of the architectural body,  the line turns the signature of the dedication into a nexus  of sensation and prehension, an  area,  for  the  sake  of  an  arbitrary  conclusion that  might   be  a snailspace about  which  we continue ever to wander in wonder.
