The  snail  is  the  totem  of  diplomacy and  of  carefully wrought  and  measured speech.  Yet the  image  that  portrays these  saintly  virtues would seem  to  have little  to do with  the  abstraction of codes  of good  comportment. The hatching of arcs  that  define  its outer  shell  stands out  against the  dense  lines  that  mark  the dark  background out  of which  the gastropod is moving. Erect, its two  antennae stand (almost  like the rabbit  ears perched on a television set of years  past)  in the atmosphere as if they were touching the air and light of the landscape to the right of the cave. A pruned trunk or stock standing adjacent to the snail’s head,  its four shoots  resembling the  two  antennae, seems  to  be  a vegetal  counterpart to  the snail and  an element, with  the elongated tree trunk on the other  side of the scene, that  frames  the creature. It is shown seeing  by means  of the antennae that  touch the  atmosphere and  the  skin  of the  snail  that  rides  over  a tuft  of grass  that  it presumably ingests.  The  spiral  shell  stands in front  of—or  is enclosed by—the rocky  outline of the cave that  soon  resembles the socket  in which  an oculus  is in orbit. In the play of figure  and ground the snail and its milieu  form a gigantic eye staring directly at the viewer. Yet the eye moves  out of the lair and  into the light as if, far beyond the meaning the text ascribes  to it, it were  a tentative constructing toward a holding in place.
