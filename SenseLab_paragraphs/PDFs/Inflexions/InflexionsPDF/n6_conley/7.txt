world. The architectural body  of their  house  begins  from  a place,  that  is clearly what  Angela  and  Robert  perceived and  what  in French  goes  by the  name  of a terrain vague—both a sort of “non-place” [non-lieu] or an “any-place-whatsoever” [lieu quelconque] and  an abstract point  of origin—where perception and  the imagination  come   together.  The  dialogue  at  once   rehearses  and   stages   the sensation of a space,  felt  “here”, that  moves  forward and  about  until  there  is gained a sense  of an open  totality of the world at large,  “out  there”. The syntax (and  Gins and  Arakawa’s syntax  and  diction is of a signature that  would be the topic  worth pursuing) indicates that  a local area,  which  is perhaps a site where sensation and  perception project  into the world extramissively, gives out or onto somewhere else. The out of their  “apportioned out”  turns an adverb into a noun bearing  spatial  virtue.  It  “comes   to  be”  or  in  other   words, it  becomes itself, intransitively and  ubiquitously, intramissively too,  before  it is qualified nominatively as the entirety of the world, “the everywhere.” The hypothesis that they  call a purposeful guess engages the tactile  movement of perception goes into the world such that  a locale and  an open  whole  are felt to be as much  within and without.
