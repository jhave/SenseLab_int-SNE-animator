When Angela  (whose  name  carries  inflections of angularity, of angles  in the stenography of geometers that  are emblems of eyes seen in profile)  opens  herself to  her  host’s  space,  cognizant of  some  kind  of  “handle” she  is  holding, that Arakawa deftly  tells  her,  “you  need  to slide  it to the  left at the  same  time  you push it  upwards” (2002: 25).   Angela  suddenly remarks, “If  I push it  to  one side…It  is as  if I am that snail…How  does  that  song  go  again?” (25, emphasis added). Gins  responds that  she  easily  recalls  “that  song  whose   lyrics  are  the parent text  to this  house’s  theme song”  which  is titled  Snails. A note  following lyrics  indicates that  the  verse  of four  stanzas is taken  from  Escargots, a poem  in Francis  Ponge’s  Parti pris des choses, whose  musings “adumbrate our  concept  of an architectural body” (26).  In accord  with  analogy and relativity, and in playing on  the  quasi-identity of  things infinite  and  things intimate, of  the  identity of things organic and  things inorganic, the authors note that the snails’ architectural heritage is of stature equal  to that of the human species  and,  “far more  intimate,” indeed “prefigures the  concept  of an  architectural body,  a concept  that,  for us, has been decades in the making” (27).
