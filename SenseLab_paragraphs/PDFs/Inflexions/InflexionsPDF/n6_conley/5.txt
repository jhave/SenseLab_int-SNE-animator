Toward the middle of the Architectural Body, in a chapter titled  “Architecture as Hypothesis,” Arakawa and  Gins state that for them  architecture means  a tentative constructing  toward a holding in place (23, emphasis in original). “Walk  into  this building,” they  continue in leading the  way,  “and you  walk  into  a purposeful guess.  The  built  world floats  a hypothesis or  two  as  to  how  and  by  what  the apportioned out  comes  to be everywhere, the everywhere” (23). It is hard to tell what  the guess might  be until,  in the dialogue that follows,  two guests, two stand- ins  for  the  readers, pay  the  authors a visit.  Arakawa welcomes “Angela” and “Robert”  not  with   the  appropriate sign  that   mediates the  rush   of  doubt or strangeness that  comes  with  the  arrival of  a  stranger—“hello, be  my  guest,” words spoken to dispel  disquiet—but with  a spatial marker, a deictic that  locates the presence of what  seems to be an absent  dwelling. “Here  is the house  we were telling  you about,” he says, to which  Angela  responds with  a deictic that  mirrors his own,  “I don’t  see any house  here.”  The house  that  she comes  to see becomes, it is hoped to be shown in this recorded lecture,  an event  of the first magnitude.
