Now,  as a first  point,  what  we  understand by a constructing  toward a holding in place figures  in an  almost  timeless field  of tension between sentience that  is by nature topographical and  intellect,  which  leans  toward the cosmological. When  we are  constructing toward we  touch  upon what  is immediate and  in our  vicinity. When,  coextensively, we reflect on touching we wonder about  how a “holding in place”  can  be held  in a greater and  even  infinite  extension without grounding. Reflection  turns on the very traction of attraction. Arakawa and  Gins invite  their guests to heed  the  ways  that  that  a sense  of proximity comes  from  within and without the body,  and how that proximity gives way to an anchoring in space for reason  that   the   latter   is  indefinite  and   often   inscrutable.  They   force  us  to reconsider the  grounding principles of geography as they  have  been  inherited from  Ptolemy. As a second point,  which  will  be treated in the  first  place,  their architectural body  is  one  in  which  the  built  form  constructs itself  within the sentient being  as it moves  in the world. The body  draws at once from itself what it encounters at the  same  time  it gains  awareness of its environment in what  it senses  in its midst. In doing  so it creates,  in a strong philosophical sense, an event of itself.   To see how  it suffices  to see how  and  why  Gins  and  Arakawa ask the guests who  visit  their  garden to  become snails. For  them  the  snail’s  pace  is the snail’s  space  and  the  snail’s  place.  The snail  becomes  the  emblem of the  event, which  they call the tentative constructing toward a holding in place.
