A second poem  titled  “Humansnails,” follows  and  responds to the  first  in the manner of a palinode (2002: 30-32).  A rewriting of Ponge’s  Escargots, the verse, which  Arakawa calls  “solemnly merry stanzas” (30), serves  a guide for  those who   are   becoming-snails.  Like   the   exemplary  gastropod,  they   also   glue themselves  to  the   ground  on   which   they   move;   transform  the   earth   into themselves and  the architecture of their bodies;  “expel,  exude,  and  disperse it” as well (31); go through telluric  matter just as it goes through them.  They ingest  and excrete  their  architecture in  symbiosis with   the  most  immediately proximate space.  Drawing, much  as the gastropod moving over  the page  of Ponge’s  poem, figures  from  the material not cited  in the first verse,  the poem  reprises interpenetration of active  and  passive elements by suggesting that  a first  shell, that  is the tender protoplasm of the body  and  “wrappings of sited  [hence topographical] awareness”, is covered by a protective “second shell”  or skin that is  an  architectural surround, perhaps snail’s  own  coquille. It  ends,  too,  where Ponge  had  remarked that  the  humansnail cannot  emerge from  its shell  without moving, and  there  when it stops  to rest  it retracts “into  its next  pair  of shells” (32). This beloved creature is naturally timid,  and  in all likelihood, like an animal of Duchamp’s ilk, it is given  more  to breathing than  to working.  It feels how  its actions   grow   out   of  it  “like  fingernails”  (32),  which   would  be  the  delicate antennae that might  also be a snailfinger. It can find infinite  wealth in the way, in
