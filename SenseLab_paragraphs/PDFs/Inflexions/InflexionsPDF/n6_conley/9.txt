heavens that  bear on the infant  as it moves  out of the mother’s womb  and  enters into the world. The astrologer accounts for the tensions of the planets that  affect the character of the baby  when it is born  into  that place—and not  another—at a determined point  in this  world, at a given  time,  the  coordinates of which  bear upon and  even  shape  the  character of the  infant.  Implied is that  the  infant  is situated and  somewhat pre-destined;  that  its  psychic  and  physical geography begins  from  where it first  is in  respect to  a fabulously extensive and  limitless world;  that  its being  can only be felt on the basis of the point  whence it begins  or begins  to become.  Implied too, is that  “constructing toward a holding in place” carries  a highly  psychogenetic force for the reason that the expression requires us to think  of the fate of place  which  we might  wish  to believe  determines how  we happen to be where we are and,  perhaps less immediately, what  and  how  we do with  our  ongoing spatial psychogenesis. In glossing Arakawa and  Gins’ words, the  matter of  constructing  toward  could   be  both   psychical  and   embryonic, a continual growth  of  perception  of  place   by  way   of  motion  or  motor   force allowing,  chemin  faisant,  as  it  goes,  a  greater  sense,   first,  of  the  distinction between  here  and   there,  and   then,   in   continual  process,   of  their   common
identity—and vice-versa.
