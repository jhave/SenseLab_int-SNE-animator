surround‚Äù (71) the  pupil of the  eye  resembles a polar  projection  of the  earth: lines  of longitude converge at the  pole  that  is the  center  of the  pupil just under the first fold of the upper eyelid  while  four  distinct lines of latitude describe the Equator, Tropic  of Cancer  and  the Arctic Circle. From  this point  of view  the eye looks upon the cosmos  that  is already within or reflected it. It sees (but it cannot be known if it discerns) the entirety of the heavens on which  it might  be gazing. Further, the projection doubles that  of others,  each of a different scale, found elsewhere in the Cosmographia.
