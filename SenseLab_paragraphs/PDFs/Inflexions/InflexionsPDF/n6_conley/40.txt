Such is the snail of the twentieth emblem of the Hécatomgraphie. The gastropod is set in the broken surround of frame  enclosing a monolingual emblem in which  a motto  in superscription, Secret est à louer [Secrecy  is praiseworthy], is set above the  surround of an integral oblong  frame  that  encloses  the  woodcut image  of a snail that  emerges from a cave or a dark  lair. Below the image  (or, in the idiolect of  the   emblem,  the   inscriptio)  and   within  is  a  quatrain  in  subscriptio  that “explains” or mediates between what  is seen and what  is read  just above: “Just as the  slug  lives/In  his  shell  in  great   secrecy/So  then   humans  carry themselves/Enclosed & covered in discretion.
