refrain  of a rondeau, a late-medieval poem  whose  architecture is as round and inwardly turning as the shell of the snail] into itself, as if in inner  cogitation until, to the contrary, it begins  to move  when it exposes  its nudity to the world. [2] It streaks. But it streaks in a space, at a place and in a pace of its own. For Ponge  the snail  at rest  gets  going,  and  for Arakawa and  Gins  it goes,  it stops  to consider itself, it goes on, and then possibly thinks about  where it is moving while holding itself in place.  They insist  that  the snail is glued “bodily” to a first shell, its own, and  to a second, the “clumped earth” that they eat and  excrete so deliciously that they  go through it as much  as it goes  through them.  The  snail’s  body  is what attaches the constructed space of its own to what  it assimilates.
