The resemblance of the snail-as-eye in the Hécatomgraphie and  the eye that  stares upon the  city-view while  reflecting a portion of the  cosmos  indicates how  the architectural body,  the site of the psychogenetic process  that  Arakawa and  Gins call  a tentative  constructing  toward a holding in place is tied  to  an  enduring and productive tension—a tension that  we all carry  within ourselves—of topography and  cosmography. Ptolemy’s Geographia, the  founding text  of the  science  of the same  name,  begins  on the ground of an analogy in which  the study of the world in the heavens is shown attached to that  of local places  without respect to where they  are  within the  greater matrix,   if  such  a  matrix   there   is.  Topography  is discerned through the sense  of apportioned things and  places,  indeed by way  of the  snail’s  journey  into  the  world that  it touches with  its embryonic eye.  That very  eye  spirals inward and  outward, with  equal   centripetal and  centrifugal charge,   as  it  gains   contact   with   the  earth   that   is  in  and   of  its  own   bodily architecture. Put  in brute  and  simple  terms,  what  Gins and  Arakawa describe as
