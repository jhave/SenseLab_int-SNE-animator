As a coda  it is worth seeing  how  the  authors leave  traces  of their  spatial forays on the pages  of their  own  work.  The dedication that  the authors penned over the title  page  draws a  broad  squiggle over  architectural body before  the  squiggle narrows, much  like the  meanders of a river  flowing over  a gently  sloped plain, making eight  bends  until  the  line  twice  bifurcates, a first  trait  leading over  the inscription of the date  and  place (N. Y., 2009) and  then  crossing the slight  paraph of Arakawa’s signature and  ending with  a directional arrowhead that  suggests the line will continue its trajectory. The meandering line then  turns and  ends,  a bent  and  pendant member, with  an arrowhead in the crotch  between the line to the left and  the other,  to the right,  that  begins  traced  upon the river-like line, and ends  where its  arrowhead points to  the  line  flattening and  extending a  what would be  the  “ins”  of  Gins.  Her  signature, toward which  the  trait  is  drawn, becomes  the horizon of a continuous landscape while  Arakawa’s, over which  the long line carries,  is sloping and  accidental. The dedication could  well be the line the  snail  leaves   in  its  path   as  it  invents  its  landscape and   as  the  signature becomes  the  event  of that  landscape. It would be the  indeterminate deictic,  too,
