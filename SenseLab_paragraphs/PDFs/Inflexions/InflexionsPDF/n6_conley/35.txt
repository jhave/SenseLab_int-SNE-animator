Toward the end of Escargots Ponge  goes on to note that  snails are fabled  because, like all creatures whose  home  is their  carapace, a part  [partie] of their  being  is “at the same  time a work  of art, a monument” (2002: 27) that  lasts longer  they.  They are  saints  for the  reason that  they  make  their  lives  and  their  beings  a work  of art—a  work  of art  from  their  perfection” (27). “Leur  sécrétion même  se produit de telle manière qu’elle se met en forme. Rien d’extérieur à eux, à leur nécessité, à leur besoin  n’est leur oeuvre. Rien de disproportionné—d’autre part—à leur être physique”  (27)  [Their  very  secretion is  produced so  as  to  be  set  into  form. Nothing outside of them,  of their  necessity, of needs  is of their  work.   Nothing— furthermore—is disproportionate  to  their   physical  being].   Their   being   is  so perfect  that  their  ejections  or secretions are part  of them.  They  are in and  of the architecture  of  their   surrounding  and,   furthermore,  what   makes   them   the creation they  are  is  an  inherent modesty and  a  tentative way  of  living  with themselves and  the spaces  they build  from within and  without their  bodies.  And the letters  of their name  they carry with  them,  before the fact, the signature of the poet,  which  is traced  through them.  Any  and  every  reader quickly  notes  that  in francisponge is the very presence of the escargot.
