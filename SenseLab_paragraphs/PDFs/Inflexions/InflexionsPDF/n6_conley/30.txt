The implied political  history of the snail’s two  bodies  is left aside,  and  so also is what   the  poem   makes   of  the  snail’s  solitude,  its  discretion,  the  eyes  of  its antennae and  its  spittle.   With  these  traits  the  snail  bears  a  king’s  demeanor. “Seul, évidemment l’escargot  est bien seul”  [Alone, obviously, the snail is indeed solitary]. Like  a  regent, “[i]l  n’a  pas  beaucoup d’amis”  (26) [he  doesn’t   have many  friends].  Perhaps, notes  the poem,  his majesty  owes  to an inherently self- contained—indeed  discreet—quality  that   ennobles  the   earth   when  the   one creature becomes   a  collective   body.” “Rien  n’est  si  beau   comme   cette  façon d’avancer si lente  et si sûre  et si discrete, au  pris  de  quels  efforts  ce glissement parfait dont  ils honorent la terre”  [Nothing could  be more  handsome than  this way of moving ahead so slowly  and so surely  and so discreetly, and at the cost of what  efforts  this  perfect  slippage with  which  they  honor  the  earth].  And  if the snail  succumbs to anger  it translates into  drool—bave—rather than  cackle, noise or yacking—bavardage. Because  the  snail  cannot  spread its arms  as does  Angela when  she  moves   into   space,   it  lets  its  excretion  become   its  best   of  mode expression.  “La   colure   des   escargots  est-elle   perceptible?  Y  en   a-t-il   des examples? Comme elle est sans  aucun geste,  sans  doute se manifeste-t-elle par une  secretion de  bave  plus  floculente et plus  rapide. Cette  bave  d’orgueil. L’on voit ici que l’expression de leur colère est la même  que celle de leur orgueil” (26), which  becomes   their  “trace,” a  form  of  writing that  becomes   “brilliant when drying” (27). And  any  and  every  reader who  touches the words of the poem  as might  the snail  that  moves  over  them  quickly  notes  that  in Francis  Ponge  is the very presence of the escargot. [3]
