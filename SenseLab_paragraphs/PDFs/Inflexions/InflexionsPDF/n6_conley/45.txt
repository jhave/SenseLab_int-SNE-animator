Yet, when seen  as  a  pupil and  part  of  an  image  of  an  isolated eye  the  snail indicates that  it may  belong,  much  like Architectural Body, to an articulation of a “roomy” or even  cosmic  setting  upon the “snailspace” for which  it serves  as an embryonic  emblem.  In   synchronous  manuals  of  cosmography,  the   science devoted to  the  description of the  world in  the  greater milieu  of the  heavens, various authors—Ptolemy, Johannes Werner, Pieter  Apian,  Antoine du  Pinet— explain the  distinction of geography and  topography through the  juxtaposition, on the one hand, of a world map  and  a portrait of a sitter,  adjacent, on the other, to a city-view contiguous with  the image  of an isolated eye and  ear. Such are the elements  that   are   distributed  in   Vivant   Gaultherot’s   woodcut  image   that efficiently  (if not  abruptly and  arrestingly) illustrates the  distinction of the  two sciences.   Drawing  on   Werner’s    gloss   of   the   first   sentences  of   Ptolemy’s Geographia, the author and  the artist  assert  that  the description of the world can be understand when a mappa mundi is juxtaposed to the head  of a sitter  whom a painter portrays. World   and  face  are  set  adjacent  to  each  other   yet  with  the suggestion  that   the   sitter   seen   in   profile    (who   happens  to   bear   strong resemblance to  common images   of  Jesus  Christ)  is  also  looking   at  the  mappa mundi  to  which  he  is  being  compared. Below  those  two  woodcut images  are found a city-view (in this instance a town  built upon what  appears, as in Thomas More’s Utopia, to be a floating  island) to the left and  to the right  an isolated eye and  ear. The ear seems  to be the opening of a cave into which  intrepid explorers can descend, while  the eye stands alone and  appears to stare at the city-view just as the  sitter  gazes  upon the  imago mundi  in front  of us. When  examined closely the eye and  its socket resemble Corrozet’s snail. When further enlarged or shown in  what   Arakawa  and   Gins   call  the   “nearnearground”  of  an  “architectural
