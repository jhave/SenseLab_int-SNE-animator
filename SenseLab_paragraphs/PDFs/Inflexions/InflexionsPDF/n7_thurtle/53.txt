moving at a slow  rate,  while  the  background of the  object moves  very  quickly. The  object  moving  slowly   would  have   a  different  felt  potential  for  change because of the  movement of the  other  objects.  The result  is the  registration of a quickening or denouement in the  capacity for change and  not  just the straightforward suggestion of a capacity for  change. The  implication of this  is that  a constantly changing world may  not feel vital if the rates  of change remain stable.  A vital world, instead, has discernible changes in the capacity for change, either  in the increase  or decrease of potentials. [8]
