a simple  cinematic shot, capturing a world as it unfolds.  This is because in film, the  relationship between durations within the  cel are  already composited and flattened by the  cameraâ€™s  remarkable ability  to instantaneously record complex information about  relationships. All  one  needs  to  do  to  film  the  scene  of two people talking in the  park  is to let a camera roll. Film automatically flattens all the temporal information into a series of single frames.  In a sense the camera has already composited the  differential rates  of change of many  different elements within the  image.  One  of the  values  of studying animation, therefore, is that  it makes   apparent  how   the   relationship  of  two   items   in  differential  rates   of movement can lead  to a greater sense  of life or vitality in the  scene  as a whole. Motion  then  emerges as a quality of the differential rates  of change of elements within the  film  and   not  just  through the  changes  in  duration  presented by different frames.  The use of layers  guarantees the durations of the motion of an object  is  always gauged in  relationship to  the  durations of  motions of  other objects on the other  layers  of celluloid. [6]
