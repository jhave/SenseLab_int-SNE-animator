This is not a trivial  difference: the metaphysical differences between ‘putting an object in motion’ and  ‘choreographing the changing rates of relationships’ are profound. In one, one takes  the movement of the world for granted; in the other, one assumes continuity needs  to be created from  a changing world. In one, one places   the  premium on  putting objects  or  subjects   into  movement  and   thus privileges a conception of movement in relationship to subjects;  in the other,  one places  a premium on the means  for creating a stable  world and  thus  privileges a conception of movement as a quality in itself.  One  highlights a physical world predicated on mechanical causality; the other  a physical world predicated on the thermodynamics of entropy and order.
