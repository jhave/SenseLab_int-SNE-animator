In  the  hands of  a  virtuoso animator the  world can  crackle  with   possibility. Stephanie  Maxwellâ€™s   film  Currents  (2008),  created  in  collaboration  with   the musicians  Michaela   Eremiasova  and   Jairo   Duarte-Lopez,  effectively demonstrates what  I mean.  Stephanie Maxwell  uses  the differential relationship between layers  in compositing as well  as adding a new  layer  of direct  work  on the  film in order to giver  her  work  a sense  of liveliness, captivating the  viewer with a vivid  sense of transformation and change.
