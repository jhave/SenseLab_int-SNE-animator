Although animation shares  with  film the importance of the cut between frames, it also adds another compositional element: the use of multiple layers  to compose the  complex temporal relationships within the  frame.  To  balance   change and continuity, the  animator must  hold  some  forms  in  the  film  static  while  others morph and  change. The  animator, then,  never  just  puts  an  object  in motion in front  of a static  background, or just  disrupts continuity through editing, she  is always choreographing  the  changing rate  of  relationships, and   she  needs   to breaks  up each frame  into layers  to accomplish this.
