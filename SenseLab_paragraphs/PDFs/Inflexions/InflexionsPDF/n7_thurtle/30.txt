It is for these  reasons that  many  who  analyze animation do  so by using  ‘time’ instead of ‘motion’ as the main  analytic. Many  of these  studies incorporate Gilles Deleuze’s  construct of the  time-image to help  shift  the  emphasis of the  analysis away  from movement, per se, to the analysis of time as a quality dependent upon but  irreducible to movement. [5] These  studies do  this  however, by adopting a specific approach to manipulating film: that  of the editor as she splices  disparate images  together in order to evoke  a sense  of time abstracted from the movement of elements within a scene.
