The Harvard group is not  the  first  to recognize animation’s special  capabilities for   depicting  life.   Disney    artists    Ollie   Johnston  and   Frank   Thomas  also recognized  animation’s  ability   to  suggest an  “illusion of  life”  (Johnston and Thomas 1995). Even the Latin root, animat, means  to “instill  with  life”. Perhaps a detailed investigation into  the  processes of  animation might   help  reveal  new ways   of  thinking  about   change,  time,   and   vitality?  And   why   doesn’t   the seemingly similar  art of film carry the same strong associations with life?
