Mitchell’s   contribution  to   this   discussion  is   his   appeal  to   a   tradition  of experimental vitalism instead of the  well-known tradition of theoretical vitalism. Experimental vitalism did  not worry about  making metaphysical distinctions between what  was  mechanistic and  what  was  living,  instead they  were  more interested in the  object  or system’s  capacity for change. According to Mitchell, “Vitalist  bioart  is . . . primarily exploratory and  experimental: that  is, rather than seeking—or seeking  to safeguard—the “meaning of life,” vitalist  bioart  instead explores what  life can do”  (Mitchell  2010: 32). This then  shifts  the register of the debate away  from  identifying or  defining what  life  is to  a  way  to  gauge   the potential for transformation in a specific  context.  Or as Mitchell  aptly  notes,  “In describing one  tactic  of bioart  as vitalist,  I have  in mind this  sense  that  science must  keep  itself open  to the  future, to concepts and  practices that  have  not  yet come into being”  (33).
