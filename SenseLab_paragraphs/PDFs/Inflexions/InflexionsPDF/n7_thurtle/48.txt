Rob Mitchell’s  recent  work  on bioart  is a useful  place  to begin  thinking through how  insights on  the  dynamics of  animation  directly implicate how  we  think about  life and  vitality. For Mitchell,  “bioart” is any form of art that  takes  biology and  biotechnology as its problematic. Thus  a play,  where living  actors  perform, would  not   be   bioart   unless   it  somehow  problematized  biomedical  issues. Mitchell  then  distinguishes two  broad categories of bioart:  the prophylactic and the  vital.  Prophylactic bioart  aspires to  safeguard against specific  outcomes in society’s use  of biotechnology. In  order to  do  this,  it often  relies  on representational practice to present a troubling outcome. Vitalist bioart,  however, uses the material of life in the artistic  product and  is more  closely aligned to performative  traditions  in  the   arts.   As  Mitchell   notes,   the   effect   of  much prophylactic bioart  is to create  greater conceptual distance between the observer and  the  observed. Vitalist  bioart,  on the  other  hand, minimizes this  distance by directly engaging viewers in the project  or by more  indirectly playing on fears of unsafe  outcomes or by evoking disgust.
