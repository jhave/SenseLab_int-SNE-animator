And  this brings  us back to the animation of the mitochondrion that  I started this article  with.  The parts  of this  animation that  best  suggest vitality are  the  small moments when the techniques of animation become  the most apparent, when the animators are  unable  to  fully  close  the  compositing  of  the  frames,   and   the animetic intervals disrupt the  cinematically overdetermined  movements of organelles or molecules. These  moments allow  for a sense  of the  potentiality of change, a  feeling  that  the  unexpected may  happen. These  moments are  also important as  they  allow  for  a sense  of how  dynamics at  molecular scales  are especially unstable  and   resist   easy   definitions  of  movement.  The  molecules visible  in these  films exist through the vagaries of energy and  molecular effects, such  as Brownian motion or surface  tension. The smaller the molecule, the more open  and  less determined are the kinetic  interactions actually portrayed on film. In these  cases, animetic intervals can even  suggest the different types  of change required in complex biomolecular interactions precisely because they do not collapse  all change into a single duration.
