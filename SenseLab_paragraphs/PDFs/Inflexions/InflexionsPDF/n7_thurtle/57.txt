This implies that  there  is no divide between vitality and  molecules or between life  and  mechanism. Vitality  emerges as  the  differential in  potential rates  of change, in this  case between molecular and  cellular  scales,  and  not  as a special property of life, per  se. This  is an  interesting and  novel  way  of thinking about organic and  non-organic processes where  vitality is  not  a  special   process   or substance of the  living,  it isnâ€™t  even  a tendential relationship of some  forms  of organized matter; rather, it is the  felt  discontinuity of potentials that  emerges from the differential energetics of scales folded upon each other.
