Verina  Gfader   adeptly applies this  strategy as  she  argues that  the  flickering screens   seen   in  Phillipe  Parenno’s  animations rupture  space   and   allow   for animation to erase  itself.   Gfader  uses  Deleuze’s  concept  of ‘point flicker’ in her essay  to explain the “moment in film where the image  – a contrasting black and white  screen, a ‘lighting’ that goes on and off – is constituted outside organic representation (i.e.  the  figurative), and  is  explicitly   associated with  dynamics inherent to  animation” (Gfader  2008: 150). Parenno’s  use  of flickering screens, then,  operate much  like the  dynamics of the  ‘cut’ in the  time-image, where the relationship  between  frames   is  broken through  dis-continuous juxtaposition. This allows  for an experience of time  not wholly  dependent upon content and  a type   of  perception  that   moves   beyond  the  recognition  of  organic  forms   in motion.
