Elizabeth Buschmanâ€™s film in this issue  of Inflexions, dowhile (2009), is interesting in  this  regard. As  the  dancers repeat gestures while  dancing on  a hill  during sunset, LEDs  on  their   chests   flash  with   each  beat  of  their   heart.   Buschman choreographs a number of different types  of movement by  making the  viewer aware of pre-accelerations. How  does  the  motion of the  heartbeats relate  to the motion of the  movement of the  bodies?  To the  setting  sun?  Although a  very tightly inscribed definition of movement would not  be able to think  about  how different  changes  in  the   dance   effectively   relate,   the   broader  definition  of movement highlights the  incipience of change and  the  non-reducible effects  of movement relating to other  movements (Buschmann 2009).
