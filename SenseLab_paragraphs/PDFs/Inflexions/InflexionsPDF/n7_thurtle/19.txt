Movementâ€™s  preacceleration  is  expressed  in  animation through  the active  interval between frames.  Thanks to the persistence of vision,  the interval  between  the   frames    remains  imperceptible  as   such,   the moving-image apparently seamless unity  across  the cuts of the frames. Yes the  interval is nonetheless active  in  the  watching:  it  is a virtual event   in  which   the   spectator  unwillingly  participates.  We  do   not actually see the  interval, but  we  do  feel its force  as it infolds  into  the perception of the moving image (113-114).
