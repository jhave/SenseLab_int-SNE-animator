Like Êtienne-Jules Marey  before him, McLaren’s  experimentation with  the incipiency of movement involves creating new  techniques to catch movement in passing. His interest in technique is an exploration with  the technicity of the “how” of the movement moving: ‘How it moves  is as important as what  moves’ (McLaren  2006). The how of movement moving is movement’s virtual becoming, its preacceleration. (Manning 2009: 113)
