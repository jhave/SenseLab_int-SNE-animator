Film is able to depict movement despite the fact that each moment is captured on a stationary frame.  In a phenomenon referred to as “the  persistence of vision”, the act of perception blends each frame  together into a continuous movement. In order to do this, the frame  rate of the film has to be within specific allowances of perception (in this case 1/24th of a second) and  each frame  needs  to be separated by   a  gap.   Movement  is  either   continuous  or   discontinuous  based   on   the relationship between frames.  Large  jumps  in continuity between frames  leads  to the choppiness of the movement of a subject,  whereas small  changes can lead  to the perception of slow,  gradual change. Film’s ability  to depict movement, then, is a manifestation of the relationship between the duration of the internal frame of a shot  and  the  differential of the  border of the  frame.  As  Deleuze notes  in Cinema 1, “It is movement itself which  is decomposed and  recomposed. It is decomposed according to  the  elements between which  it plays  in  a set:  those which  remain fixed, those to which  movement is attributed, those which  produce or undergo such simple  or divisible movement. . . . But it is also recomposed into a greater complex indivisible movement according to the whole  whose  change it expresses” (Deleuze 1986: 21-22). A complex world of change, the relative change of  all  the  objects  captured in  a  film,  is  then   recomposed  as  the  differential between framed images  on celluloid.
