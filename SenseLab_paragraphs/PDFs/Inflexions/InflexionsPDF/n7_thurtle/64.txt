In Creative Evolution, for  instance, Bergson  discusses the  importance of the  “sensory-motor system”: “the  progress of the nervous system  has  been  effected  both  in the direction of a more  precise  adaptation of movements and  in that  of a greater latitude left to the living being to choose between them” (Bergson 1911: 125).
