The  world presented  through  digital technology is  an  increasingly animated world. World  Wide Web content shifts and  morphs through the use of rollovers, pop-up windows, and  embedded movie  clips and  illustrations. Street  signs  and billboards  shimmer  and   change  to  catch   the   eyes   of  passersby.  Animated computer and  video   games   are  now  one  of  the  most  popular entertainment forms  (Kowaliski 2009), while  older  entertainment forms,  such  as films, increasingly incorporate computer-generated special  effects. Despite the fact that our  world is increasingly an  animated world, only  a handful of scholars have begun to consider the manifold ways  that  animation inflects  the way  we interact with the environments we find ourselves in.
