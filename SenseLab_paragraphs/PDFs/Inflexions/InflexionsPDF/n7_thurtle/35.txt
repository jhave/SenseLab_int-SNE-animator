At this  rudimentary level,  the  problem with  this  is that  it assumes that  force  is creative  only   when  it   breaks   stasis.   What   we   are   left   with   is   a   binary metaphysics:    inside     frame/outside    frame,     change/stasis,    or force/representation. Is it possible to  think  of a type  of change where change itself  is primary and  stasis  is only  a by-product of the  combination of different rates  of change? Is it possible to see how  all the  elements in a filmic  sequence contribute to giving  that  sequence its own  unique sense  of change beyond the skills  of  the  editor and  director? For  instance, can  we  imagine how  the  trees might  sway  at a different rate of movement than  the accelerating automobile and come  to understand how  this  contributes to our  feeling  of time  and  movement within perception?
