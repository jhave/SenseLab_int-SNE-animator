This reliance  on the interval between the frames  is a reference to the specific dynamics of how  the frames  on a film relate  to each other.  The interval, or the space  between one frame  and  another, allows  for motion. It provides the ‘cut’ that allows  for perceptible change across continuity. This broad conception of movement is especially useful  for thinking about  how non-movement can also highlight the tensions in a film. Since movement is always felt in relationship to its preacceleration, the lack of movement is always sensed as the potential for more  movement. A pregnant pause can suggest future change through its stagnation  and   thus   allows   one   to  become   aware  of  movement  and   its tendencies.
