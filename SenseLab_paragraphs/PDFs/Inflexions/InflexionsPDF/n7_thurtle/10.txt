stability to  a  world that   has  to  be  continually recreated. How   the  animator creates  stability in her animated world informs that  world with  a unique poetics of change. For instance, the  South  African  fine art  animator William  Kentridge works  by drawing on paper with  charcoal  and  capturing on film a drawing at a specific stage. He then  erases  and  redraws parts  of the drawing in order to allow specific parts  of the world to change. Kentridgeâ€™s technique builds a world where gestures and  objects  precipitate from  smudged black  masses  and  linger,  caught between the constant pulse  of change and ghostlike traces of erased images.
