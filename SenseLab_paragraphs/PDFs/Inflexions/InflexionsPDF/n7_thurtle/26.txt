There  are other  problems with  this as well. Not  only  does  this idea  of a moving subject  highlight a limited, subject-centered agency,  it also tends  to conceive  of a world where all forms  of force are thought of in terms  of mechanics. We see this in  the  quote  from  Jordan  above,  when he  quickly   subsumes sensation to  the importance of action.  For Jordan,  what  is important is to remain active  because action  allows  one to distinguish between one’s self and  a static  world. Although useful,  sensation should direct  but  not overshadow action;  to do so would be to literally reduce agency  to vegetation. He even warns against the danger of ennui that  can  be brought on  by reading too  much  French  literature as it can  lead  to feelings  that  are divorced from the active principle of movement. If rendered too simply, thinking of force  only  in  the  mechanistic sense  of the  displacement of objects  through space  can lead  to the  dangerous equating of a subject’s vitality with that subject’s ability to move.
