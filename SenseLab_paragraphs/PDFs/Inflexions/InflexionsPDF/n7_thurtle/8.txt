Unlike  film,  animators must  create  a  new  world for  every  frame.  This  offers those  of us who  study animation an insight into the role of stability and  novelty in change. For example, imagine one of the simplest forms  of animation, line animation directly on  the  film.  An  animator confronted with  a  strip  of blank celluloid must  draw their  elements in  a way  that  allows  for  the  continuity of form  and  location  within each  frame  in order for the  element to persist beyond the  fleeting   durations of  the  projected  single  frame.   This  already places   the practices of animation at a conceptual distance from  film.  In film,  the  primary task  is to  capture the  movement of a stable  world already in  motion. [1] The tradition of filmmaking thus  isnâ€™t forced  to confront the  importance of stasis  in the creation of novelty. In animation, the immediate task is not, how do I put  this world into  motion (by directing the  subjects  in the  film) and  then  capture it on film  (by  cinematography) but,  rather, how   do  I  best  utilize   the  relationship between change and stability to create a perceptible world in constant change?
