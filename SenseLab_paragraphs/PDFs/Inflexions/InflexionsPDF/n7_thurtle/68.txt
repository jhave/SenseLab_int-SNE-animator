[7] A  quick  glance  at  what   has  been  labeled “vitalism” in  biological   thought resists  this  easy  but  persistent characterization. In fact,  this  is one  of the  great values  of Mitchell’s strategy as it calls for a greater understanding of the different types  of vitalism. Few vitalists fit comfortably in positing an absolute distinction between vital  and  material substances. Even  Hans  Driesch  claimed that  vital process  did  not break  laws  of physics, they  just “suspended” the more straightforward  mechanical energetics (Driesch  1914: 202-206). Mitchell  is also smart  to locate vitalism in empirical as opposed to theoretical accounts. Many  of the  theoretical accounts appeal to  the  importance of the  experimental work  in developing their  views  (Driesch   1914).  A  good   accounting for  the  continued vitality of  vitalistic   thought can  be  found in  Cangulhem 2008. Unfortunately, despite the  work  of those  like  Jane  Bennett  (Bennett  2010: 66-81), most  recent studies of “vitalism” have sought to locate continuities behind the claims of those who   were   labeled  vitalists.  This   approach  has   led   to  an   overemphasis  of Aristotelian metaphysical distinctions without the benefits  of Aristotelian models of causation. This is the approach of Bechtel and Richardson 1998, for instance.
