The benefit  of this position is that  by placing activity  as a necessary condition for cognition it allows  for a perspective of the world that is inherently embodied and doesnâ€™t  only  privilege clear  and  distinct reasoning as a modality for processing the  world.  Subjects  are  always engaged through relating, perceiving, emoting, and   moving, so  recognizing  how   these   inform   experience  is  important. The problem of this position is that  it can unwittingly emphasize an older  conception of a dynamic agent,  where movement is too easily equated with  personal vitality and  social worth. When  the world is thought to be static, and  objects are then  put into motion across a static background, it is commonly perceived that  the subject is doing  the  movement. What  is lost is the  perception of a world in movement that occurs around the subject.
