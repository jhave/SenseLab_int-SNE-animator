[6] A note  here  on terminology: I will be following Deleuze’s  analysis of Henri Bergson’s concept  of duration found in his Bergsonism, 73-89. Although the term “flux”  may  seem  more   appropriate at  first,  it  eventually  ignores my  overall argument that  the  study of the  animation process  by concentrating on layers  as surfaces allows  one to turn  what  may  be a flux or rhythm into  a perceived and manipulable duration.
