or an élan vital, that  was  thought to inhabit and  give life to an otherwise mechanistically inclined universe. [7] In some theorists’ hands, this led to a sharp division between the  metaphysics of living  objects  and  the  metaphysics of non- living   objects.  Most  recent   authors  agree   that   this  distinction  is  difficult   to maintain. Richard Doyle,  for instance, has  argued that  we  live in a “post-vital” period where the  distinction between the  “vital’  and  the  “mechanical” is  no longer  tenable or  possible (Doyle  1997). Even  more  recently, Jane  Bennett  has argued  for   holding  a   theoretical  position   that    is   “neither   vitalism  nor mechanism” in thinking about  the agency  of materials (Bennett  2010).
