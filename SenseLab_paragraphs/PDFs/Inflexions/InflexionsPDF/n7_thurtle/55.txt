Maxwell  renders the  animetic interval visible  through the  obvious layering of image  on  top  of image.  This  allows  her  to  manipulate gestures and  shapes as waves  rippling across frames,  some growing, some attenuating, but never  all beginning or  ending on  the  same  cut  or  edit.  Thus  we  see  the  undulations of waves  before  we  see the  filming  of the  sea  and  these  undulations persist even after  the sea makes  its appearance. Maxwell  also works  directly on the film. She applies splashes and  lines of paint  that  further accentuate the animetic intervals within and  across  the frames  of the film. The effect is a sense  of liveliness of the image   as  it  shifts,   flickers,   morphs,  emerges from,   and   dissolves  into  other images.  Stephanie Maxwellâ€™s  work  is useful  in summing up  this discussion as it helps  us see how the vitality of animation comes from the difference in two relationships, the relationship between the frames  that  allows  for the perception of  motion  (as  in  film)  and   the   differential  relationship  between  the   layers composited on  each  frame  that  allows  for  the  perception of the  change in  the potential for change (through the animetic interval of open  compositing).
