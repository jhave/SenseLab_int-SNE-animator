It is important to emphasize that  my use of Stiegler  and  Bazin is not intended to deny  that  interventions happen during the  photographic process.  Cameras are positioned, exposure times chosen,  scenes are edited, and  elaborate scenes can be posed. Rather,  Iâ€™m more interested in how analyzing the processes of filming  and animation allow  for a different emphasis on when and  how  these  interventions are applied and how they help us understand a world in constant change.
