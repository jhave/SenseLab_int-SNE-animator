In  the  past,  eliding the  cinematic and   the  animatic has  too  often  led  to  the assumption that  animation is a special  case  of filmic  practice. This  denies the amount of work  that  goes into making animation seem like film. There  has been a rich history of technological developments, for instance, intended to tighten the compositing  of  the  animation  (such   as  the  multiplanar  camera or  tweening between key  frames)   or  to  lend   especially  cinematic  camera  views   (such  as panning or  flying  through). It  also  tends   to  deny   the  diversity of  animation techniques, many  of which  develop from  the material constraints and  resources of the medium and tend  to present change in their unique ways.
