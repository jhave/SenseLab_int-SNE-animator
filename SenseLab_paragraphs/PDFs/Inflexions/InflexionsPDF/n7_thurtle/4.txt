One   especially  interesting  application  is  the   use   of  animation  in  scientific practice. Biologists  are very  keen  to find  ways  to visualize the way  that  cellular components  move,   fold,   and    assemble.  As   Janet   Iwasa,    Lecturer  in   the Department of Cellular Biology  at  Harvard, recently confided to the  New  York Times, “Just  listening to  scientists describe how  the  molecule moved in  words wasn’t  enough for me…What brought it to life was  really  seeing  it in motion” (Olsen  2010). Her collaborator, Tomas  Kirchhausen, anti-intuitively suggests that it is the  realism of animation that  allows  him  to problem solve  at the  molecular level: “All that  we had  before  — microscopy, X-ray crystallography — were  all snapshots. . . . For  me,  the  animations are  a way  to  glue  all  this  information together in some  logical  way.  By doing  animation I can  see what  makes  sense, what  doesn’t  make  sense.  They force us to confront whether what  we are doing is realistic  or not” (Olson  2010). By allowing researchers to focus on interactions (as opposed to defining molecular components), animation can then  serve  as the
