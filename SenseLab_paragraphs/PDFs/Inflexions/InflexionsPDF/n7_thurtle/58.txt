And,  finally, it is important to recognize that animation will only become  a more important tool  in  the  future of biomedical research and  education. More  and more  scientists will  look  to  animate the  data  they  collect  in  order to  see  how complex interactions can be enabled through molecular interactions. I expect that these   animations  will   be   used   to   convey   much   useful   information  about biological  processes. One  of these  uses  will  surely   be  the  visualization of the movement of  molecular and  cellular   processes to  see  how  radically different sizes, durations, and  thermodynamic states  mesh.  I also hope  that  there  is room
