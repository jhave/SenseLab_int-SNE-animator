This approach is best envisioned by imagining how  cel animation is created, an art made  famous by Max Fleischer,  Walt Disney,  and  Warner Brothers  as well as others.  Every  image  in  cel animation is a composite of the  layered images  of multiple sheets  of celluloid.  The scene moves,  or comes  to life, when the objects on  one  sheet  move  in relationship to the  objects  on  other  sheets.  For  instance, animating two characters talking in the park  requires the construction of two celluloid layers:  1) a background layer  with  grass,  tress,  and  shrubs and  2) a subject  layer  with  two  figures in different poses  (Lutz  1920: 70-71).  The subject moves   by  changing the  layers   of  the  subject   in  relation to  the  layer   of  the background. The difference between the  rate  of movement between the  objects depicted on each of the surfaces allows  for the appearance of differential rates  of movement in the world. The animator recomposes each frame  of film by folding together these  different rates of change. This process  of folding layers  together to make a complex image  is called “compositing”.
