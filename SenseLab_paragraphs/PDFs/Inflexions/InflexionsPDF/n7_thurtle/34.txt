It is important to recognize that  although this  disruption in continuity gives  the viewer a new  way  of thinking about  change, it does  so in a very  limited fashion. The  problem is  that  the  time-image still  conceives   of  the  image  frame  as  the producer  of  change.  The   frame   operates  as  a  “closed   system”  where  the differential between frame and gap create information (Deleuze 1986: 12-18). This is very  much  an editors’ and  directors’ view  of change where the  director puts scenes  into  motion through  framing and  the  editor brings   together disparate motions by  creating cuts  in  sequences. Change then  only  becomes  that  which breaks  stasis to create either  movement or time.
