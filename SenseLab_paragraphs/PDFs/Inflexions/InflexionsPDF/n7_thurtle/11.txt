Animation’s balancing of ‘creating stability from  change’  is very  different from the  metaphysics of ‘capturing movement’ that  film seems  best  at. According to André Bazin, in his essay on The Ontology of the Photographic Image, “The objective nature of photography confers  on it a quality of credibility absent  from  all other picture making. In  spite  of any  objections  our  critical  spirit  may  offer,  we  are forced   to  accept   as  real  the  existence   of  the  object  reproduced,  actually ‘re- presented, set before  US’ that  is to say, in time  and  space.  Photography enjoys  a certain  advantage in virtue of this transference of reality  from the thing  to its reproduction”  (Bazin   1960:  7-8).  According  to  Bazin,  photography’s  special qualities allow for the capturing and  re-presenting of the real existence  outside of the  camera. It is also this  ability  to reflect  reality  that  Bernard Stiegler  grasps at when he suggests that  photography is a “mirror reflecting the past”.  The mirror of photography is good  at capturing “what happened” but  since  this  is always something that  has  just passed, this  reflection is always an “adieu” to what  has just occurred (Stiegler 2008: 16).
