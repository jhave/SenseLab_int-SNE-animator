between the  frames  to  create  the  illusion of continuous movement. Parenno’s flicker  films  use  the  gap  between frames  to  disrupt  sequential movement. As Deleuze recognizes in  his  description of  the  time-image in  the  Preface  of  the English  edition of Cinema 1, “it is no longer  time which  is related to movement, it is the  anomalies of movement that  are  dependent on  time”  (Deleuze 1986: ix). These  discontinuous juxtapositions  disrupt the  movement of  the  subject  and allows  one a sense of change independent of the movement of actors or objects.
