A good  example of this  is the  use  of stop-motion animation. Here  the  animator uses  the displacement of characters between frames  in order to create  a sense  of movement in the film. If the animator wants to bring  an object to life, she places the   object   differently  in  the   frames.   The   object   then   appears  to  move   by manipulating the  relationship between frame  and  the  composition of the  shot, the  de-  and   re-  composing mentioned  by  Deleuze above.   The  resulting  film allows   for  the   appearance  of  an  inanimate  object  to  come   to  life  through movement.
