Even  though in Foreman’s view,  we  are  not  the  stewards of the  world, we  can provide space  for  the  large  carnivores that  Foreman’s book,  Rewilding  North America:  A  Vision  for Conservation  in  the  21st  Century,  refers   to  as  “keystone species”   (Foreman 2004: 119). Large  and  predatory  non-human mammals are seen  as keystone supports for any  ecological  renewal of future wildlands due  to their  sophisticated food  chain  balancing technics  and  their  role  as reminders of the awesomeness of large untamables loose on striated and  fecund lines of flight.
