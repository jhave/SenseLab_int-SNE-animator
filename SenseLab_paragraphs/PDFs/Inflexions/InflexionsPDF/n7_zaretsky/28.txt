But all these prejudices which  I here undertake to point  out depend on  this  solely:  That  it  is  commonly supposed  that  all  things in nature, like men,  work  to some  end;  and  indeed it is thought to be certain  that God Himself  directs  all things to some sure end, for it is said  that  God  has  made  all things for man,  and  man  that  he may worship God.  This therefore I will investigate by inquiring, firstly, why  so many  rest  in  this  prejudice, and  why  all are  so naturally inclined to embrace it? I shall  then  show  its falsity  and,  finally,  the manner in  which  there  have  arisen  from  it prejudices concerning good  and  evil, merit  and  sin, praise  and  blame,  order and  disorder, beauty and deformity, and so forth. (1952: 369)
