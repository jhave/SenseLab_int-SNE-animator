There  is a reconfiguring going  on in the  critical  bioethics  community that  veers away  from pragmatic readings in ethics. Policy makers focus on what  should and should not be done  to balance  preservation of dominant ideologies by timing the release    of   shockingly   different   technologies.   Avoiding   the    philosophical tendency   towards   grand   schema,  critical    bioethics    brings    the    angle    of questioning into  the  realm  of: who  are  we,  what  are  we  in, and  how  does  that make  it difficult  to decide where we might  go with  all this? In “The Bioethics  of Metadesign,” the concluding chapter of his book Biomedia, Eugene Thacker  spells out  the  differences between  philosophical,  applied  and   critical   bioethics.   “If emerging biotechnologies are transforming our  basic notions of ‘body,’ ‘nature,’ and  the ‘human,’ then  it follows  that  a bioethics  capable  of accommodating such transformations would itself  have  to be adaptable and  flexible.  And  this  might very  well entail  a critique of the philosophical foundations of applied bioethics.” (Thacker  2004: 176).
