One  of the conceptual goals  of ULS is meant to aid  the public  in understanding the  socio-cultural and  ecological  reverberations that  gene  insertion into  living systems might  bring  into  our  lifeworld experience. Utilizing a genomic palette, the  potential range  of expression represents a wide  and  varied canvas.  Public comprehension of the process  of transgenesis through hands-on experience, including  the   relationship  between  safety,   aesthetics,  and   responsibility,  is implicit  in this field. A great  diversity of commentary is encouraged through this pastiche  of  ideologies.  Ecology,   bioinformatics,  ethology,  embryology, gastronomy, cell biology  and  physiology intermingle in ULS. Current advances in the technologies of germline genetic  enhancement may lead our species  future into another round of ill-fated  historical shame. Without a radically open understanding of comparative genomic diversity, evolutionary uncertainty and acceptable aesthetic breadth, we may end up “enhanced” without the celebratory relish implied by the repro-genetic arts. Couched in terms  of anti-anthropocentric posthumanism,  VASTAL  and   ULS  critique  naïve   libertarian  transhumanism while   encouraging  explorations  of  subaltern  a-human  identity.  Beyond   the medical and  staid  aesthetics of neurasthenic scientism, let us chart  the enigma of life.
