Zylinska is using  Deleuze’s  Spinoza to read  how  and  why  bioart  is interrogating the  politics  of living.  The  artists  of biology,  be they  “high” artists  in  the  open (open  source  or open  reading frame)  or unintentional, outsider artists  of the lab (scientists), subvert  the  tidy  avoidance of  the  issues  of  bodily   difference.
