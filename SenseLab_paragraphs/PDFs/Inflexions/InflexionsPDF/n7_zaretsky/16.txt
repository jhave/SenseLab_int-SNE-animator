What was once a preventative choice has become  a pro-active entitlement,  exacerbated by  the  sense  prevailing  among  current elites  that  one  has  the  right  to control  all aspects of oneâ€™s life and shape  them  by buying and  periodically upgrading the best  that technology has to offer, be it a computer, a car, or a child. (Hubbard and Newman 2002)
