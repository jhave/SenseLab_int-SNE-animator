The  VivoArts School  for  Transgenic Aesthetics Ltd.  (VASTAL)  was  formed in
2009. Vivoarts, as I have  been  defining it, “is an umbrella term,  [that]  may  help us sort the full range  of aesthetic and  social concerns faced while  considering the question  of  life  in  art.  Simply   defined,  what   I  call  Vivoarts  is  any   artistic production  that   has  a  living   component  embedded  in  it  at  the  time   of  its exhibition” (Zaretsky 2005). The  school  was  opened as both  an  artistic  gesture and  in order to make  hands-on biotechnology labs more  accessible  to the public. During the following year,  VASTAL publically held  living-art performance labs with   accompanying  Unstill   Life  Studies (ULS)  lectures.  VASTAL  public   labs educate through the use of life as an artistic  medium to analyze the aesthetics of transgenic technologies in  both  non-humans and  humans alike.  VASTAL  was formed in  order to  aid  in  public   comprehension of  the  project  of  hereditary control.
