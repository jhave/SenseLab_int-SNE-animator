An impromptu artist  and scientist ‘expert’ avian  enrichment oversight group was formed on the spot.  We talked about  how  to gauge  or assess  the effectiveness of our contributions as non-scientists. We distinguished anthropocentrism from anthropomorphism and  tried  to keep  from  practicing either  to any  excess.  We made  sure  that  we reached a consensus before  presenting the chicken  gifts. Our collaborations  were  not  grievously detrimental and   were  determined by  our group to be “appropriate enough” for chicken  well-being. We then  bridged the gap.  We  gave  gifts,  enrichment attempts  and   performances to  Koen Vanmechelen’s chickens;  on  live  display in  a  nearby solo  art  exhibition. Our initial   offerings  were   somewhat  spontaneous  yet  tame.   Most  of  these   trans- species  enrichment devices  were  fashioned from  pet  store  purchases, safe  and geared towards avian  perceptual life. Many  food  gifts were  gingerly hung from the  wire   fencing   of  the  containment  chicken   coops.   One  of  our   conceptual enrichment artworks on paper was  offered  for their  non-human critique. Eventually, the group performed an attempt at interspecies communication with the chickens.
