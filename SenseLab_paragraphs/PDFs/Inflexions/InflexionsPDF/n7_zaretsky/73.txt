Investigating ethology and  art for non-humans, art for all phyla  and  art for AOL, discussion is primarily on what  we can do to familiarize ourselves and  positively add  to a non-human perceptual and  experiential world. Although anti- anthropocentrism is a global  theme running through all of our  labs, it is the  art for non-humans lab that  converts life as a media into  contact  with  and  gifts for other  life as the  medium of artistic  expression. Unfortunately, the  stewardship involved in  taking   the  role  of  enrichment provider assumes that  behavioural service   leadership is  the  best  tactic  for  a  non-human’s benefit.   Often   actual enrichment specialists are called  upon to develop toys or provide novel  versions of work  for a non-human due  to a perceived need  for therapeutic relief. In zoos and  other  holding containers, un-enriched, stressed non-humans are  perceived by human spectators as unhappy, pacing,  even exhibiting the neurotic behaviour of a captive being. A repetitive environment without facets or interest often leads non-humans towards self-  destructive  behaviour. If  this  just  comes  down to training captive non-humans to act “naturalistically” for human spectators, then how  is enrichment anything but anthropocentric? What  else can non-human enrichment hope   to  achieve   beyond  allaying alienation in  captive organisms showing signs of stress?
