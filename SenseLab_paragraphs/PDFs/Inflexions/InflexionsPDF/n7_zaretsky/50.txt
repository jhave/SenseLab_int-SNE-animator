The  Enrichment Arts  Lab  is  based   on  the  premise that  an  understanding of designing animal enrichment devices  might  also help  human participants appreciate  the  similarities  and   the  differences  between  all  organisms  living (AOL).  Enrichment is  a  practice of  increasing the  quality of  life  for  animals outside of their  natural environment. From  the  simple  concept  of enrichment a wide  variety of ideas  can arise.  Animal enrichment is a design process  that  may alleviate some  of the burdens of being  in the space  of captivity on a daily  basis. Animal enrichment  is  also  a  novel  way  to  understand animal behavior and reveal  the complexity of animal consciousness. The lab uses ethology, the science of animal behavior, to design appropriate art for chosen  non-humans. Review  of ethological concepts, philosophies,  field  based  practices as  well  as  the  critical history of ethology are meant to aid in enrichment device  design and  application. In this particular VASTAL Ethology and  Art for Non-Humans: Enrichment Arts Lab, the emphasis was on avian  ethology. [9]
