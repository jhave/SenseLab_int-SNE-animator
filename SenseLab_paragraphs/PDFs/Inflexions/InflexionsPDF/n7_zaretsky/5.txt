molecular biology,  into  the  nucleus every  one  of  the  organism's cells.  Transgenic organisms are  walking around with  non- spontaneous  expressible molecules in their  bodies,  minds (if they have  minds) and  the  genetic  material that  goes  on  to  make  their children. Sometimes referred to  as  hybrids, cyborgs  or  chimeras, transgenic organisms are an interspecies mix of DNA, a targeted collage of two or more  organisms. The most important thing  to remember is that  their  alteration is permanent and  inheritable. That means  that  their  kids  and  their  grandkids have  the same  difference that they do.
