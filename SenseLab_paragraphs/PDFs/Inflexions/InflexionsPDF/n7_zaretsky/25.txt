Spinoza has an alternative system  for assessing these  issues.  Writing in the mid- to-late  17th  century, Spinoza’s  philosophy emphasizes the decentering, distancing and   even   removal  of  the  human subject   from   ethical   debate.  The  Ethics  of Spinoza are  based  on  a radical anti-anthropocentrism, dismissive of identity as anything but  temporary form.  After  a canvas  of Spinoza’s  Ethics we will look at Deleuze's version of Spinoza’s  thought, which  emphasizes an “ethics  without morality,” an ethics that  is an “ethology,” a “typology of immanent modes of existence,” a practice of “nonsubjective affects” (2004: 189-190).
