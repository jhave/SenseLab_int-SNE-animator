semblances that  men  are  content with.  Not  only  are  they  content with  the  latter,  they  feel a hatred of life, they  feel ashamed of it; a humanity bent  on  self-destruction, multiplying the  cults  of death, bringing about  a union of the  tyrant and  the  slave,  the  priest,  the judge,  and  the  soldier, always busy  running life into  the  ground, mutilating it, killing  it outright or by degrees, overlaying it or suffocating it with  laws,  properties, duties, empires â€“ this  is what Spinoza diagnoses in the world, this betrayal of the universe and  of mankind. (Deleuze 1988: 12)
