Spinoza  posits   that   the  set  composed  of  allness   is  an  infinite   collection   of thoughts and  actions  of nonhuman existence,  some active and  some representing the realm  of the possible but not in an authoritative position. Spinoza rejects as a common weakness the proposition that  the extended thinking thing  of totality is to be imagined as a king  (1952: 374). Infinity  is not a patriarch. This would be a case of identification with  the oppressor formulated in the imaginations of those in need  of attention, albeit  often  negative in its faux  human-centric importance. These  needs  for  personality from  the  mysteries are  unending, where even  an abusive demagogue is a version of the personal. For Spinoza, a human-shaped or reflective  god  is opposed to the  joyful  passion of being  an independent facet of the infinite.  Of all things to come up against the anthropomorphizing of the vast universals: a call to good  feelings?
