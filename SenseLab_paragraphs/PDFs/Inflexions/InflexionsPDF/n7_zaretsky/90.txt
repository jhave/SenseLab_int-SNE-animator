The study of animal behavior has even  bled  over  into entomological personality studies. “In  her  current  research at  [UC]  Davis,  Judy  Stamps, a  professor of biology   and   animal  behavior,  has  seen  how   early   experience  effects  habitat selection  in  drosophila, better  known to  you  and  me  as  the  common fruitfly” (2006: 55). Seibert explains, by comparing early fruit fly childhood experience and drosophila  personality, Professor Stamps has  found that  “Fruit  flies  born  and raised  on a plum, for example, will seek out the next plum to settle on, as will the offspring they  raise  there:  a ‘no  place  like home’  impulse. But in the  course  of their  research Stamps and  her  students have  also  encountered everything from overly  shy, timorous flies, to bold trailblazers, to downright feisty and  ultimately self-defeating bullies”  (2006: 55).
