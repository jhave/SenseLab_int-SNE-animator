In  the  arts,  and   the  larger   world,  performance  of  applied stewardship and concepts of  rewilding have  credence in  the  ecological  equation. According to Dave  Foreman,  co-  founder of  Earth   First,  if  we  are  going   to  have   a  green imagination for the  future, we are going  to have  to keep  in mind not  just other ecosystems but  the  actual  landmass that  we  need  to  give  back  to  make  fully- flared  biomes.  The  future of biodiversity relies  on  abundant open  spaces.  In a non-anthropocentric utopian ethical  and  aesthetic future we  will  need  to  give back one-third to two-thirds of the landmass that we have domesticated. The extensive crust  area  that  has  been  put  under industrial utilization needs  to  be rehabilitated  into   vast   wild    spaces    for   non-humans  and    their    ecological components of planetary metabolism. These  spaces  and  being  denizens are  not just preserved as a resource reservoir but  are worthy of biophilic freedoms and shared existence  maximizations.
