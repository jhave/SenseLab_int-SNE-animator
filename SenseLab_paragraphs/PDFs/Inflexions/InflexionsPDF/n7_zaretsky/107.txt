[11]  The  fashion  of  a  drag   king   styled   as  a  big  hairy,   queer   bear,   or  the shimmering strut  of a preteen enveloped in a sharkskin zoot-suit can  easily  be compared to the  origin  of beards, shoulders and  hips  which  are  both  inherited fashion and  accentuated versions of other  animal traits  (i.e., iridescence of fish, bold  stature of  large  carnivores,  etc.).  Our  anatomy  (neurological as  well  as skeletal,  muscular, etc.) is partially inherited fashion with  all the  kitsch,  cliché and  outdated trends which  fashion’s  petulance implies.
