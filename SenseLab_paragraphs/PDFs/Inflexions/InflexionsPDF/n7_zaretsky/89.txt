It is fair  to say  that  anyone with  any  amount of quality time  spent  interacting with  animals would concur:  animals have  personality. Now  we have  repeatable proof   that   personality  is  not  just  for  humans  anymore. “In  the  years   since Anderson and  Mather’s  original paper,” Siebert continues, “a whole  new  field of research has emerged known simply as “animal personality.” Through close and repeated  observations of  different species  in  a  variety of  group settings and circumstances,  scientists are  finding that   our  own  behavioural  traits   exist  in varying degrees and  dimensions among creatures across all the branches of life’s tree” (2006: 51).
