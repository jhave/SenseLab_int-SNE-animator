For  Spinoza, by  acknowledging god’s  [1] absolute will,  there  is  no  room  for moral  contradiction in the acts and  actions  of bodies,  “… since if things had  been produced in any other  fashion another nature would have  had  to be assigned to Him,   different  from  that   which   the  consideration  of  the  most   perfect   Being compels us  to  assign  Him”  (Spinoza 1952: 367-68). Positing god  as  absolutely infinite,  beyond time,  unchanging and  perfect  Spinoza emphasizes the  essential monotheism beyond the  human tendency towards cults  of personality. Spinoza decimates morality as a practice that  god  could  not  even  entertain, as there  is nothing  outside  or   independent  of   the   all   one   infinite.    This   leaves   the dichotomous banter of crust  dwelling, chest beaters in their swamp of segregated ideation. Spinoza asks  which  manifest acts  cannot  be  human folly,  ignorance, self-importance and greedy subterfuge?
