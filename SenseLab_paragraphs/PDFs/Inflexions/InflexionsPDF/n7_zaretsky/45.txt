In order to rationalize this leap  from  computer-generated art to art that  involves the manipulation of biological  life, the proponents of such  a narrative take  the  view  that  biological  life is all about  the code; that  the artists  and  the work  involved with  biological  art deal with  the  ‘code’  of life. One  can  speculate that  the  combination of genohype and  the need  for cohesive narrative leads  to ignoring the complexity of the  different levels  of engagement with  life.  (Zurr
