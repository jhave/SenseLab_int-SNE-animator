For Deleuze, Spinoza allows  humans to perceive instantiation as mere  facets on the  continuum  of  the  stardust we  are  comprised  of.  “The  bad  occurs   when extensive parts  that  belong  to us  in a relation are  caused by external factors  to enter  into  other  relations;  or when we  meet  with  an  affection  that  exceeds  our capacity for being affected.  In this event,  we say that  our relation is decomposed, or that  our  capacity for being  affected  is destroyed” (1988: 41). The emphasis on “affect”  is an  aesthetics of embodiment and  eventual non-existence -- negative relational disembodiment -- is also  an  ethics  based  on  aesthetics without self- reflection. Both dangerous and  “realistic,” Zylinska and  Thacker  ruminate on the Deleuzian Spinozaic, anti-Cartesian ethics  as another way  to comprehend the extended body  of biotechnological alterity without moral  prejudice.
