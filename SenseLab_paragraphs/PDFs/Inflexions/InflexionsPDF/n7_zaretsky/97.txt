[1] A disclaimer on the resistance to the use of the word “god.” Although, your author identifies as being  a pantheist (animist), an agnostic and  predominantly an atheist, we do tend  to reject even  the use of the word god  in press,  especially under the  rubric  of your  author’s pen  and  without catcalls  and  Bronx cheers  to round out   the  equation.  But,  your   humble author  has  found that   allowing Spinoza’s   use   of  the   word  god   and   hearing  out   the   severely  monotheistic philosophy of  Spinoza’s   Ethics is  palatable due  to  the  waste   he  lays  to  other prejudices and  preconceptions which  may  need  equal  erasure. We succumb to the  word god  in  Spinoza’s   Ethics for  the  confusion it  wreaks, the  amoralism intended and  the hilarious position it puts  human cultural crutches in. But this is a temporary allowance and I refuse  to capitalize this improper noun.
