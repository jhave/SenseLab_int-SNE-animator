Our major goal is to make  art for a non-human audience. Our work  is innovative as we intend to improve designs and  methods of expressing art for non-humans by ethological, relational, experiential and  aesthetic communication with  trans- species  in  captivity. In  particular, we  are  interested in  those  animals showing signs  of behavioural disturbance, cultural alienation and  neurotic personality disorders.  The   reasoning  behind  this   emphasis  is  that   we   would  like   to underscore the similarities, differences, power relations and  mutualisms between humans,  non-humans  and   posthumans  all  read   as  particular  cases  of  non- humans.
