These days  the idea  of a mass  movement toward eugenics is countered by many who  support “enhancement” with  an  admonishment of the  history of eugenics and   any   future  “collective program”  (2009:  74)  of  human  engineering.  In contrast, to be down with  a worthy program is to insure the  wonders of neo- liberal  economic “freedom,” as  market-driven, individual choice  (reproduction being  personal and  a  parenting act  of  volition). Implicit   in  this  subterfuge  is informed decision making and  purchase power. This  is  the  Yuppie   Eugenics option. In “Yuppie Genetics  – Creating a world of genetic  haves  and  have-nots,” Ruth Hubbard and  Stewart Newman, from the Council  for Responsible Genetics, analyze  the  difference  between  state   and   global   eugenics  policies   (past   and present). They read  the present day  emphasis on consumer driven genetic counselling as a superiority complex, a fascism of one.
