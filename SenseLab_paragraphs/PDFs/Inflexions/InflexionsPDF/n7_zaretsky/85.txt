Currently in progress, the  Wildlands Project  is hoping to prevent further mass extinction and  stabilize vast tracts  of land  by re-establishing carnivores to control the  food  chain.  At  present mostly  gun-toting, human hunters who  are  left  to control  deer,  moose  and  other  game  populations whereas Foreman suggests that this  is  actually the  ecologically sound  role  we  should re-relegate to  keystone species.  Forman is interested in strictly  protected areas  with  low to no roads  and minimal human access  which   conservation  biologists call  “core  areas”   (2004:
169). Resilient  diversity spaces  should be restored and  maintained until  the area is  able  to  maintain itself.  Interestingly, Foreman asks  us  to  envision a  world without large  carnivores, where “nature seems  somehow incomplete, truncated, overly  tame.  Human opportunities to attain  humility are  reduced” (2004: 129). Eventually, wildlife corridors could  traverse major  cities and  the  architecture of wide-swathed, urban, carnivorous, keystone species,  migration corridors could be designed and  implemented with  input and  other  help  from  those  urbanites most  prepared to advise on new  naturalism in architecture: nudists, zookeepers and inner-city youth.
