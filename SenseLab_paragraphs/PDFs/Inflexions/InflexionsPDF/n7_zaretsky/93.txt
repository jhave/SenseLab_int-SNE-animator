Therefore, contemporary insight into  enrichment practice is meant to  veer  our participants towards a decentering of human exceptionalism. Ranging from captive animals to transgenic experimental organisms to genetically modified, human suburbanites, the cyborg,  posthuman visionary question is: How  can we enrich  the  lives  of organisms living  under patent and  legally  considered mere variables  towards   efficient   industrial  productivity?  We   can   see   that    the decentered debate on design of enrichment devices  for non-human alienation inculcates Homo  sapiens [15] under the rubric  of non-humans. We conclude that enrichment is an emulation, which  redoubles the constraint of confinement.
