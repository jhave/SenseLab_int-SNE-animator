Contained in Giorgio  Agamben’s book The Open: Man and Animal is an analysis of Gilles Deleuze’s  weirding of Jacob von  Uexküll’s  study of ethological behavior. By   emphasizing  the   subjective   and    phenomenological   aspects  of   species perceptual difference, Agamben’s Deleuzian von Uexküllism sees non-human worlding “in an absolutely nonanthropomorphic way”  (Agamben 2004: 39-40) as a problem of semiotics, potentially fascist  (2004: 42-43) [2] and  even  musically interpretive ecological  dance.
