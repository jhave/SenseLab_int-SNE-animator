Biosensors and   Radio  Frequency Identity  (RFID)  data   gathering technologies emulate phenomenological experience, not  the  other  way  around. The being  of slime   molds  and   condors  [3],  [4], is  not  a  simulation  even   if  their   internal experience is qualitatively alone  and  somewhat never  penetrable. [5] There  are dangerous  sociopolitical and  aesthetic choices  being  made  for  non-human and human enrichment design based  on screen  life bias. [6] We are all already stuck in  cybernetic  versions  of  houses  or  parks   or  captive-breeding programs  for species   rehabilitation  (e.g.,  suburbia,  the  global   park   system   [7]  and   online dating). The conversion physiology into  information processing adds to the prevention of new world rewilding. [8]
