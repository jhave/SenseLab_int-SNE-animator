If ethology is the  study of living  organismic behaviour in the  field  of the  wild and,   as  intimated, there   is  no  life  that   lives  off  the  map   of  the  wild,   then, assuming we  accept  the  term  “animal in  the  wild” to  have  a  fluid  definition allowing us to equate the title “animal” to all non-humans, it follows  that domesticated humans are also animal non-humans in the wild.  We are with  our presumed selves  where we  all wildly are  now.  Our  distinct knowledge of our own   animalness  should  not   only   limit   anthropocentrism  but   limit   animal- centrism as well, in favor of organism-centrism or AOL inclusive ULS. [13] Many ethologists agree.  [14] Recent  ethological studies have  been  using  a variety of animal behavior analysis techniques  to  study insects,  fungi  and  cephalopods under the rubric  of ethology. Ethologists advise zookeepers on how  to keep  wild organisms  in   captivity  with   the   widest  breadth  of  behavioral  authenticity available in a “natural” environment. Some ethologists even use animal behavior studies to  assess  human beings.  It is assumed this  is to  encourage the  widest breadth   of   behavioral   authenticity   available   to   humans   in   a   “natural” environment of voluntary subservience, the wilds  of domesticity.
