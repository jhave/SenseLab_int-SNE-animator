…ignorant of things and  their  nature, firmly  believe  an order to be in things;  for when things are so placed that, if they are represented to   us   through  the   senses,   we   can   easily   imagine  them,   and consequently easily  remember them,  we  call them  well  arranged; but  if they  are not  placed so we can imagine and  remember them, we  call  them  badly  arranged or  confused. Moreover, since  those things  are  more   especially pleasing  to  us  which   we  can  easily imagine, men prefer  order to confusion, as if order were  something in nature apart from our own imagination… (1952: 371)
