People   had   succeeded in  diminishing themselves through  a  collaboration  of ethics and genetics.  They have domesticated themselves and have committed themselves to a breeding program aimed at pet-like  accommodation. From  this insight springs Zarathustraâ€™s specific  criticism  of humanism as  a denial of the false   harmlessness  with   which   the   modern  good   man   surrounds  himself.
