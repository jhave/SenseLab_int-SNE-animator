Continental scale  conservation is the  enlargement and  broadening of all parks and  future park  planning. The Wildlands Project  is being  undertaken to connect parks   with  green  corridors internationally across  the  US-Mexican  border and across  the  US-Canadian border so large  carnivores (e.g. wolves,  bear,  big  cats, etc.)   can   have   room    for   their   habitat  standards.  This   insistence  on   the international element is important for both the organisms who donâ€™t  know  about mapped inventions of national space  divisions and  for the global  fertile integrity which  socially habituated imaginations often disrupt.
