This  lab  was  also  a guide to assist  the  participants in becoming aware of how much   of  our  cultural landscape is  actually behavioral training  entertainment built   to  make   our  containment  seem  more   inviting.  Enrichment  devices   are figured into gross  national products as acceptable extras  towards an economy of voluntary submission: television, organized sports, spectacular wars,  cheap  fast food   and   the   intermittent  reward  of  the   occasional winning  lottery  ticket. Perhaps, the  decentering of human exceptionalism comes  from  the  other  side, not as benevolent interspecies practitioners of “the white  man’s burden,” [12] but as  an  analysis of why  we  sub-humans are  showing signs  of behavioral stress. This frames  all human beinghood as a scrutinized, trained primate subset  of non- human organismness. Stuck in a culture of containment, the symptoms of living in a maze  of regimes, forced  into  all sorts  of joys – both  tepid and  tame,  aware that  work  is made  to keep  us  busy  and  that  play  is canned to keep  us  lightly engaged, enrichment arts  are  a way  of uncovering our  own  acculturated, lived propaganda.
