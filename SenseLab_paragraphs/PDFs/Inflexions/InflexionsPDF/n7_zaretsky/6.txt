The politics  and  responsibilities of life (the  need  to wriggle and  consume) bind material and  being simultaneously to metabolism and  vice. This results in a more nuanced analytical understanding of the ethical,  libidinal and  social implications of    new    reproductive    technologies   and     their     accompanying   hereditary attenuators. This  is due  in  no  small  part  to  the  experiential effect  of hands-on artistic   lab  work.   By  underscoring the  use  of  life  for  artistic,   as  opposed to scientific  research purposes, the case study and  its accompanying theoretical explorations are meant to interrogate relations between bioethics  and  the current aesthetics  of  the  engineering  of  human  and   non-human  life.  In  relation  to VASTAL, the  aesthetic, theoretical and  ethical  questions related to  live biotechnology art  labs  as performance pedagogy are  referred to as Unstill  Life Studies (ULS).
