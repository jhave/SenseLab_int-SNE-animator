All Vivoarts labs are hands-on labs sharing lab skills with  the untrained. The difference between a technical scientific  learning session  and  a Vivo-artistic laboratory approach is mostly  qualitative. While  engaging in  the  technics,  we also deal  with  the relational issues  surrounding this type  of process:  pain,  death, responsibility, curiosity, the meddlesome sadism of a personal genetic footprint/signature/graffiti, risk assessment between foreign  species and the ecosphere, etc.  The  assumption is that  informed opinions on  present-day and near-future bioethical conundrums are more  readily coaxed  out of non-biologists through a hands-on approach. Access  to comprehension can  be cathartic but  it can also inform  critique from  a position of experience. This is the Vivoarts mode of hands-on Do It Yourself (DIY) bioethics  public  laboratory.
