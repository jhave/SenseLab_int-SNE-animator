From   the   perspective  of  critique,  we  can  ask  seemingly  naïve questions here:  Why  only  subjects,  and  why  only  human subjects? Are  there  nonhumans involved, are  there  relationships other  than agency  involved? Why general rules? … If ethics is a practice, what is   the   role   of   unaccountable   contingencies?  What,   indeed,  is
‘practice’ and  how  is it different from  a rule  or a guideline? (2004:
180).
