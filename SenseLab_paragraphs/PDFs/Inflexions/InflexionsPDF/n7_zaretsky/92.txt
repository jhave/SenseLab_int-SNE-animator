Viewed  from  a posthuman, neocolonial position, these  creatures include partial- humans, which  is to say  supposed humans or transgenic transhumans that  are somehow deprived of their  natural rites and  are showing signs of unrest, anxiety or neurosis. If we look at human culture as encroachment upon the  environs of all  organismic life,  then  those  encroached upon includes the  less  than  human homo  sapiens:  the  global  impoverished, the  incarcerated, the  institutionalized, those in alienated work  schemas or even all non-feral prisoners of cultural mores. This process  of becoming aware of lack, scams and  bad trips  calls for enrichment in the very  barren housing provided for those  held  in authoritarian storage architectures. Tactically,  it is perhaps authority as a conceptual practice in actual spaces   that   is  in  dire   need   of  alternative  enrichment  devices   to  help   gird commons destructive behaviours and reduce global stress.
