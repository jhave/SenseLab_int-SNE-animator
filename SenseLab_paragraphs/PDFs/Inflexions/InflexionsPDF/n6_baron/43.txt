define  moral  obligations and  coordinate landing sites.  In Caporael and  Baron’s (1997) terms,  “the  group is mind’s environment”. There  is evidence for example that  we indeed have  a social mind. Specifically,  Dunbar (1993) presents evidence that  it was increasing group size that  led to increased size of the prefrontal lobes with   concomitant shifts  from  nonverbal  communication  to  the  emergence of language and  abstract thought. Viewed  in this way, our wayfinding is ultimately a social enterprise. We form  landing sites and  architectural bodies  to realize  our social needs  and obligations. We image along to get along.
