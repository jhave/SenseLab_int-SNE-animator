A/G, in their  recent  treatment of imaging have  moved from  treating imaging as one of a number of ways  to form  landing sites, to giving  imaging a more  central role. Specifically,  perceiving, imaging and  dimensionalizing were  once treated as more  or  less  coequal ways  of positioning oneself  in the  surround (Arakawa & Gins  2002). In  their  present thinking, however, imaging has  taken  on  a  more central  role  (A/G 2010, personal communication). Concomitant with  this  shift, imaging has  become  “imaging along”.  It is my contention that  “imaging along” represents a critical change in how one has to view imaging.
