Now,  what  do I mean  by a horizontal dimension? I mean  that  we must  explore A/G’s concepts not  only  in an intrapersonal level. Rather,  we must  create  ever- widening  circles.  We  need   to  go  from   intrapersonal  to  interpersonal—from looking  at dyads to looking  at groups be they families,  communities, or societies. And  we need  to move  from pragmatic to ethical  dimensions. Such a dimensional shift   is  inescapable,  given   that   we  must   navigate  both   social  and   physical surrounds.  We  are   only   worthy  of  a  “reversible  destiny”  if  the   Other   in Emmanuel Levinas’ (Levinas,  Poller  & Cohen  2005) sense,  comes  along  with  us. If anything is axiomatic for  A/G’s  inspired endeavor it is that  old  ways  must change—be they  habits  of the  mind, habits  of the  body,  or habits  of relating to the Other.  And  if our  wayfinding is difficult  and  we are tempted to say that  we can’t go on, we must  follow Samuel  Beckett’s admonition and somehow go on.
