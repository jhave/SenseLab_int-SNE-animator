foundational at the levels of phylogeny and  ontogeny for reasons I will presently make   clear.  I  did   then,   and   still  now,   argue   for  the  primacy  of  perception. Without rehashing my argument (see Arakawa & Gins 2006: 110), I suggest that in the  development of the  brain,  structures supporting perception, for example, the brain  stem, evolved many  eons before the development of the prefrontal lobe capacity necessary to support higher order imaging. This is also likely to be true developmentally at the  level  of ontogeny. That  is, the  infant’s brain  is likely  to support perceptual knowing prior  to imaginal knowing if one takes  imaginal knowing to require the existence  of Piagetian types  of cognitive schemata. Such a critique is blunted if one takes a broader view of imaging as involving at its inception, a host  of sensory embodied ways  of knowing. For example, imaging may  early  on  involve what  might  be described as perceptual-sensory imaging, the kind  of imaging that  Helen  Keller learned to do so well. However, this  type of interpretation of imaging is vulnerable to Gibson’s  (1979) claim  that  imaging “is an extension of perceptual knowledge”. That is, sensori-motor and  tactile information are  integral to Gibson’s  (1966) view  that  the  senses  be treated as a perceptual system.
