First, at issue is why  we follow,  to use a nautical concept,  certain  headings? Why is there  a perpetual “turning towards”—A/G’s trajectoriness? Landing sites fully rendered do  more  than  provide a site  from  which  to observe. They,  in Celan’s (1972) terms  say,  “Don’t  look  anymore, go”.  But where, why?
