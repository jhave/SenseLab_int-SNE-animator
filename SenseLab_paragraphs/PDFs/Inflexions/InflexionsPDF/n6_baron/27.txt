There  are  a  host  of  problems with  cognitive mapping-type  interpretations  of imaging.   Specifically,  a  key  functional problem is  “that  in  imagery, physical feedback from the environment is missing, information is detached from its situation, and  reality  testing is suspended” (Jordet  2003; Looran  de  Jong 1991). Imaging, if it is detached from  action,  provides less information than  perceiving, given   that  there   are  perceiving-acting  cycles  where what   we  see  guides our actions  and  our actions,  in turn,  provide new information for where to look. That is, what  we  do  affects  what  we  see and  what  we  see affects  what  we  do.  Such cycles lead us to register new landing sites that shape  our subsequent actions  and perceptions.
