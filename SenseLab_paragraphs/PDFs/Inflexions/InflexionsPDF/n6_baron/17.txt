specifies  the  existence  of such  opportunities, given  certain  sensori-motor capabilities, experience-based inclinations, and needs  that we bring  to the setting. Therefore, I propose that  landing sites  are  selected  to exploit  affordances at the level  of individuals, groups and  larger  collectives.  Viewed  in this  way, affectivatoriness may,  at least  in part,  be driven by a hunger to achieve  certain affordances. That is, affordances give value to particular places, turning them  into attractors or repulsors. Affectivatoriness is embodied in selective,  energized wayfinding. It serves  as an emotional compass.
