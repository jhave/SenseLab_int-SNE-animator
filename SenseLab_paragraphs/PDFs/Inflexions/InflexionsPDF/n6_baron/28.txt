The above  distinctions between imaging and  perceiving it should be noted, have greater force  relative to A/G’s  treatment of imaging in their  past  publications, Architectural  Body (2002) and  Making  Dying  Illegal (2006), than  in  A/G’s  (2010, personal communication). Current treatment of imaging along,  their  most  recent theorizing, describes imaging as highly  embodied and  not detached from  action and  online  feedback. In their  current view,  imaging along  seems  to occur  in real time.  For  example, when  “I  walk  down the  street—I   am  imaging along   the happening of this”—that is, we are looking  at ourselves looking  (2010, personal communication). Such imaging along  is also unlike classical  imaging in that  it is not   detached  from   environmental information. Indeed,  A/G  suggest architectural procedures for stretching or prying apart imaging along, suggesting that imaging along can be quite  malleable under certain  architectural conditions.
