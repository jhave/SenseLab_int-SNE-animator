We begin  then  with  the likelihood that  we are always in the middle rather than at  point   zero;  we  are  already on  our  journey,  but  we  may  need   to  change directions.  This   brings   us   to   A/G’s  new   units   of  trajectoriness and affectivatoriness. Specifically,  as we  locomote, we  seek  and  we  are  sought;  we seek  particular  niches   or  behavior  settings  and   they   seek  us.  The  niche   of particular interest is Barker’s (1968) delineation of a behavior setting:  social- ecological  units  of repeated behavioral activity  that  have  a specific  time-space locus such as a classroom or a shopping mall. Behavior  settings need  us and  seek us  if they  are  to  survive and  prosper. For  example, universities with  certain strengths recruit certain  types  of students;  shopping malls  advertise to reach  a certain  demographic.
