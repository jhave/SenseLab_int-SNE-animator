A/G switch  to  “imaging along”  and  their  broadly embodied view  of imaging deflects  many  of the problems raised  by critiques of imaging. Similarly,  I have no problem with  A/G’s  view  that  the  same  landing site  might  be simultaneously registered  at  conceptual,  visual,   and   tactile   levels.  As  a  Gibsonian,  I  agree. However, problems do arise  when a judgment needs  to be made  about  whether landing sites  are  primarily formed by  imaging or  perceiving. In a exchange of letters   with   A/G (2006),  I  disagreed with   their   proposition that   “perceiving grows  out  of imaging”. This priority of imaging may  be true  functionally in an online  situation such  as in Neisser’s  (1976) model  where perception is schemata- guided (but note that even here, the results of perception yield feedback that may modify the  schemata). However, developmentally  it  is not  true.  Perception  is
