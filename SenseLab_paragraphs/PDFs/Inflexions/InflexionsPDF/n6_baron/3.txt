What  is the  metachallenge that  bioscleave demands of us?  It is, I propose, wayfinding, a wayfinding defined at many  scales  from  finding one’s  way  as a person  to  finding  one’s   way   in  a  strange  physical  or  social   environment. Wayfinding both  helps  to clarify the meaning of certain  of A/G’s new terms  and describes my  approach to unpacking the  meaning of A/G’s rich  discourse. The paper itself  is  the  process   of  my  wayfinding.  I  am  trying to  create   bridges between the new  and  necessarily incomplete concepts that  A/G are introducing and  certain  conceptual frameworks that  I propose are useful  (at least  for me) in finding my way through A/G’s terminological junctions.
