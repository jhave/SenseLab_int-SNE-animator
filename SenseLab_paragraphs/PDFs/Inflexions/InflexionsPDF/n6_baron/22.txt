In order to appreciate the importance of imaging’s becoming imaging along,  it is necessary to begin  with  traditional views  of imaging and  its limitations. Before I look  at the  classical  treatment of imaging, it should be noted that  in one  sense, A/G’s  conceptual refinement are  implicit  in the  context  in which  imaging was introduced. Specifically,  it was  discussed in the  context  of landing sites.  In my present terminology, this implies that  imaging was  in the service  of wayfinding. This  meant that  their  images  were  already on  the  go—they were  already more than  mere representations of the surround; they were transforming it.
