Further, the  somatic  aspect  of imaging is  also  illustrated when A/G  write  of landing sites  that  are  dimensionalized. We can  read  this  as an  image  based  on experiencing an  object  against the  scale  of one’s  body.  For  example, we  often insert  a person in a photograph to indicate the  scale  of buildings or sculpture. What   is  at  issue   is  registering  “location and   position  relative  to  the  body” (Arakawa & Gins  2002). Thus,  and  this  is crucial  for  A/G’s  “imaging along”, imaging is embodied in  how  we  make  contact  with  the  surround. This  helps explain how  it is that  imaging along  becomes  connected to landing sites trajectoriness. Viewed  this  way,  imaging along  functions both  retrospectively as a Proustian type record of “lost time”  and  prospectively as a guide to subsequent proper action  involving the  development of an  architectural body  that encompasses changing the surround.
