It should also  be  noted that  Shepard (1984) does  a superb job of achieving a rapprochement   between  Gibson’s    ecological    view    of   perception  and    the operation of imaging viewed as internal representation. Shepard suggests that perceiving and  imaging may  both  be constrained by higher-order informational invariants that  have  evolved to  guide locomotion. For  example, both  imaging and  perceiving utilize   information that  specifies  kinematically the  rigidity or non-rigidity of the environment—such as the ability  of a surface  to hold  its shape over   different  environmental  stressors.  More  generally, Shepard  attempts  to specify  the  boundary conditions for the  perception-based versus imaging-based pick up of higher-order invariants. Shepard proposes that  whether internal representations are  necessary, including imaging, depends on the  conditions of observation. Specifically,  perception has  primacy under favorable viewing conditions whereas representational processes including imaging, going  beyond the    information   given    (Bruner    1957),   occur    under   unfavorable  viewing conditions. These  may  be situational problems, for example, a heavy  fog or the individual constraints faced by A/G’s blind  mathematician.
