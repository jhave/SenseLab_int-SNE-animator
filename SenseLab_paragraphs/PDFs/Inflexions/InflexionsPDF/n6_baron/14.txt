But, if these  are end  points, they  are also beginnings. They drive  us back to how and  why  it all occurs—to the  constituting processes and  procedures that  have gotten us  there.  As urban wayfarers, we  are  driven to find  our  place(s)  in the ever-changing surround. Here  I will argue  that  A/G offer us the right  questions while  a Gibson-Baron type  of ecological  analysis provides at least  some  of the answers as to how,  if not why,  our  wayfinding leads  us to articulate, to discern, and  to  register where we  are  and  perhaps where we  want  to  be.  Specifically, Baron (see Baron 2007) has been concerned with  building bridges. First, from Ecological  Psychology to Social Psychology and  second, from  Social Psychology to  Ecological   Psychology.  Finally,   I  have   tried   to  bring   a  social   ecological approach to A/G’s discourse.
