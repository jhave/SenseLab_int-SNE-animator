Given that the above  account of the registering of places,  of the formation of observation points, or better,  launching pads,  how  does one move  on to form the architectural body,  viewed as a collection  of landing sites?  Such positions focus on  how   the   person  takes   advantage  of  the   architectural supports  and   the architectural challenges that  exist  as  we  wayfind ourselves through the  built- environment. In  the  view  of  A/G,  such  wayfinding allows   the  possibility of turning the  environment into  a protective shell  we  can exploit  as we  locomote. Such  architectural  bodying  is,  in  turn,   given   personal meaning through  the process  of imaging along, a process  not  unlike how  the  artist,  William  Kentridge uses drawing to connect  multiple ways of knowing the world and ourselves.
