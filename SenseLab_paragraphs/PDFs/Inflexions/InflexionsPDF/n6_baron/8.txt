My  claim  is  that  there  are  many   scales  of  wayfinding. I will  treat  the  scales problem  both    vertically  and    horizontally.   Vertically,    different   scales   are analogous to  what  Vallacher and  Wegner (1987) referred to  as  action identification. Let us  take  as our  example of wayfinding, determining whether someone  is  at   home.   The   vertical   level   of  action   is  intrapersonal  and   is determined by  the  amount of planning required before  the  action  takes  place. Thus,  the  steps  involved may  vary  from  a very  low  level  action  like moving a finger  to  push a doorbell, to  calling  the  person on  the  phone, to  sending the person an e-mail  a few days  earlier  to find  out  his/her schedule. This is not  to say  that  there  is not  a fractal-like theme that  holds  across  scales  of action.  For example, the South  African  artist,  William  Kentridge, in explaining his drawing process  suggests that  he not only thinks abstractly, but  that  he also thinks with his
