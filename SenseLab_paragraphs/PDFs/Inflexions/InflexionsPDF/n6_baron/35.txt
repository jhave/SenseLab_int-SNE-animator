Further, images,  to the  extent  they  become  conceptual; and  I would still  argue that  normal adult imaging is heavily  conceptual, can  become  rigid  and  create problems when the  current circumstances don’t  meet  the  expectancies induced by  the  images.  It is one  thing  to  claim  that  images  can  be  stretched. It is also possible that schemata-type concepts like images  can become  stereotypes leading us  to  ignore  changing circumstances that  don’t  fit  past  images  (see  Taylor  & Fiske  1984). Again,  this  problem would not  apply to  imaging that  primarily occurs at a sensori-motor level as in the “muscle memory” for bike riding.
