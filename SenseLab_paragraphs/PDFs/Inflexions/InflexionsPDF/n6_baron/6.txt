Further, whatever the specific concept  we are dealing with,  it implies one metaproperty—a  sense   of  holding  open.   There   always  must   be  a  space   for inquiry (see Baron  2008; Adcock  2003). This is perhaps best  captured in what  I regard as one  of the  richest  of A/G’s metaconcepts—tentativeness. Specifically, tentativeness  implies, as  illustrated in  the  words of  the  South  African   artist, William  Kentridge, Dthe value  of doubt … that’s how  we go through the world” (Tompkins 2010: 59). Within  A/G’s discourse, it is the  stuttering before  change can  occur;  it  signals  that  we  are  the  cusp  of change. Here  we  experience the greatest  fluctuations  as  the  system   tries  out   different  directions  for  change. Viewed  this  way,  tentativeness aligns  well  with  Kurt  Lewin’s  (1958) model  of change that  takes  “unfreezing” of  one’s  initial  state  as  the  starting point   for change. And  more  concretely, tentativeness describes an architectural procedure, a particular set of operations for manipulating the architectural surround. I now propose that  tentativeness is also often  the impetus for wayfinding. It can be an important energy source  for  our  attempts to  find  new  ways  to  person in  the context  of Bioscleave.
