Further, and  this  is crucial,  imaging for A/G is not  simply a top-down process. Imaging  can  be  dispersed—decentralized.  Images   can  be  organized heterarchically rather than  hierarchically. This means  that  images  are not limited to the visual.  For example, unlike Lynch  (1948), both  A/G (2010, personal communication) and  Ahsen  (1977) emphasize that  images  have  a somatic component that  represents body  feelings.  Specifically,  imaging for A/G is multisensorial. It involves smells,  tactile  remembrances, etc. They  are all part  of imaging along. A/G differ from Ahsen’s somatic  imaging which  looks backward.
