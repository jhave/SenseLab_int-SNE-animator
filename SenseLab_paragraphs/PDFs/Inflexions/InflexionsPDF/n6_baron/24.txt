cognitive map  was introduced by Tolman  (1948); his maps  focused on how  “rats and  men”  represent the  various paths to consumatory goals—how to get to the food.  This  approach was  generalized in  Kevin  Lynch’s  (1960) Image of the City which   focused  on  how   we  create   cognitive  maps   of  familiar routes  as  we locomote through  the  urban architectural environment. For  Lynch,  there  is  a particular emphasis on the cognitive maps  of familiar neighborhoods. In the traditional imaging literature, (see Roger Shepard 1984), there  is a consensus that the  core  aspect  of an image  is that  it is a visualization of a scene,  or pattern of activity  in situ such as in an urban architectural settings. To these classic views  of imaging we  need  to add  Neisser’s  (1976) treatment of schemata. They  serve  to guide perceptual activity—where we look and  what  we see are shaped by these schemata. They  function to  tune  the  perceptual apparatus, thereby helping us differentiate or articulate an environment. Viewed  this  way,  Neisser’s  schemata resonate with A/G’s use of imaging as a way to register landing sites.
