Viewed  thusly, trajectoriness and  affectivatoriness reflect how  and  why  our wayfinding is biased in systematic ways.  From this perspective, affordances are a major  source  of  such  biasing.   We  land  where we  do  because here  there  is  a meshing of our  needs  and  response capabilities with  the  availability of certain opportunities for action.  More specifically, affordances are the functional utilities offered  to  us  by  certain  places,  people, groups, settings, etc.  Stated  in  A/G’s terms,  affordances spell out how we might  person in ways  that take advantage of what  the surround offers. Trajectoriness and  affectivatoriness describe our preparations to land  in certain  sites rather than  others.  They  reflect  the processes that  allow  us to become  attuned to affordances as well as the processes involved in how  affordance entrain and  yes, even  seduce us. Think  about  how  a bumble bee is seduced to alight  on a particular flower  rather than  another one.  A/G in these  precursor concepts are orchestrating such  flights  and  through their architectural procedures, providing us with  the tools to deconstruct such  flights. They  enable  us to freeze  frame  the stages  involved in forming a landing site on route   to  forming  an  architectural  body.   And   lest  the  general  point   become obscured, both Gibson  and  A/G’s concepts are about  the reciprocity between organisms and  their  surrounds. One  difference, however, is that  A/G do  more than  take  advantage of this  reciprocity. Through their  architectural procedures they   are,  in  effect,  creating  new   reciprocities that   change  the  capabilities  of people in ways  that  open  new  options for survival. In effect, they  are giving  us meta-affordances that can increase  our basic adaptive capability for survival.
