or anorganic, matter is not  restricted by God’s  choice  for the  actual  world and encompasses all  subsisting possible worlds. Even  if the  law  of pre-established harmony guarantees that the moral  order of souls and  the natural order of bodies fuse on a shared continuum, the  actual  does  not constitute the real, which  must itself  be realized in ‘accidental’,  intermonadic relations. Again  we  see why  the bodies  in which  hallucinations can be realized are not necessarily individual and hence  do not necessarily exist.14  Since the process of realization does  not bear  on the virtual but on the possible, a body  of sensation or matter of fact always being potentially a non-individual “monument” for  the  presence of a possible world within the actual  world.15
