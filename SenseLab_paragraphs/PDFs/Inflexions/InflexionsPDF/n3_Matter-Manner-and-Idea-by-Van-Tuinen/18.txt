In terms  of Leibniz,  the  difference between the  actualization of the world in the appetitions and  perceptions of individual souls  and  the realization of the world in  bodily  interaction is not  a difference between two  kinds  of substances, but between two kinds  of distributing the world, between the soul taken  as a monad in  itself  and  the  body  taken  as  a  composite of  several   monads. A soul  is  an eternal individual unity  whereas matter is a continuously varying multiplicity, an aggregation of aggregations ad infinitum. Since what  is real must  necessarily be  one,  it follows  that  matter or  extension does  not  exist.  In  this  way  Leibniz subscribes  to  the  idealist  conviction  that   the  extended  world  exists  only   in monadic perception.
