perspective of monadology, it is an infinitely divisible masse brute, made  up of an unformed flux  of  monads chaotically traversing all  kinds   of  interactions and compositions, its indistinct collectivities corresponding to the  variability of the unconscious  flux   of  perception  included  in   every   monad.8   If  the   soul   is nonetheless capable of extracting distinct perceptions from  this insensible flux of perceptions, in  the  case  of  humans even  self-conscious apperceptions,  this  is because  it  possesses  a  mediating  body   or  “primary  matter  (prima  materia)” capable of selecting and  organizing disparate individuals into the unity corresponding to its “point of view”9.  For Leibniz  the soul is the “foundation (fundamentum)” or “form” of this  organic composition, whilst  the  other  monads that  participate in it are merely its “requisites” or “material”.10 In fact, matter is present only  through the  organic body  in  which  extensive phenomenona  are “realized” and  otherwise remains fully abstract and  ideal.11 In order for a phenomenon to be “well-founded”, by contrast, there  must  correspond to each of the soul’s clear and  distinct perceptions a fully evolved organ,  such that  a perfect “resemblance” between “private” perception and  “public” bodies,  between form and  content, is guaranteed.12
