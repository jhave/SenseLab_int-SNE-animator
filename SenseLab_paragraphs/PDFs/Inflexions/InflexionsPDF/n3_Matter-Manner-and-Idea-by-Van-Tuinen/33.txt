According to  Proust, the  signs  of  art  are  “ideas” or  “essences” that  make  us “‘emerge from  ourselves’” with  the result  that  we gain access to other  regions of Being enveloping other  worlds: “‘Thanks  to art, instead of seeing  a single  world, our  own,  we  see it multiply, and  as many  original artists  as there  are,  so many worlds will we have  at our  disposal, more  different from  each  other  than  those which   spin  through  infinity …’” (cit  PS 42, 38, 41) Art  is  able  to  include an infinity of possible worlds within the real world because its signs are incorporeal or spiritual. Matter  subsists as long  as we discover, by way  of analogy, a sign’s meaning in something else. Even though two subjectively associated sense impressions or sensuous signs such as the Madeleine and  Combray, or the cobblestones  and   Venice,   may   have   the  same   quality,  they   are  nonetheless materially two  and  differ  from  each  other  in extension. It follows  then  that  the sign  still  possesses a  minimum of  general  signification. (PS  40)  Only  in  art, Deleuze argues,  do  sign  and   meaning coincide,   because  ideas,   prior   to  any “natural  differentiation”, “differential” essences   or  primordial  qualities form both the “birth of the world” (PS 47, 44, 98) and  “the finality  of the world” (PS 49,
137), without ever  being  reducible to the subjects  or materials in which  they  are expressed.27  Art’s  sole  aim,  then,  is to propagate a singular viewpoint through the   world  without  invoking  the   recognition  of   anything  that   is   already subjectively  or  objectively  given.   In  this  sense,  as  Charles de  Tolnay  writes, Michelangelo “did  not intend to represent things as the human eye sees them  but as  they  are  in  essence;  not  as  they  appear but  as  they  are  according to  their Idea.”28 Or as Proust says, an artistic  sign is the mark  of “‘a qualitative difference that there  is in the way the world looks to us, a difference which,  if there  were  no such thing  as art, would remain the eternal secret of each man.’”29  (cit PS 41, 148) In his classic Idea (1924), Erwin  Panofsky argues that  Michelangelo is a precursor of  modern  expressionism,  insofar   as  he   derives  his   creativity  not   from   a subjective but from  an involuntary, cosmic principle that  functions as the divine or eternal condition of possibility of all creativity.30 Similarly,  Deleuze insists  that an   artistic    sign   is   an   involuntary  idée-force animating  all   creativity:  “the generative force from which  issue the multiple compossible worlds that make  up the real” (PS 99). In art neither the spectator nor the artist  is the foundation of the way  the  world looks  to  us,  but  neither is it the  material of the  work  of art  in which   it  is  expressed.  Rather   it  is  “an  absolute and   ultimate  Difference” or “difference in itself”  that  constitutes an  impersonal perspective simultaneously
