Not all signs and  not all styles are, however, artistic.  Outside of art, Deleuze distinguishes “signs  of worldliness”, “signs  of love”  and  “sensuous signs”.  Here signification is sooner  or later appealed to as either  subjective or objective compensation for  the  impossibility of completely explicating or  identifying all the  possible  implicated  worlds.  (PS  34-6)  Objectivism  or  naturalism  can  be defined by the tendency to equate what  a sign designates (its object) with  what  it signifies,  as if the object itself possesses the secret  that  the  sign  emits.  (PS 26-33) Subjectivism  then  appears once  we  learn  that  the  object  does  not  give  us  the secret   we  were   expecting  and   the   signification  becomes   constituted  by  the associations of the  subject  instead. Although the  sign  is now  understood to be more  profound than  the  object emitting it, it is still attached to that  object, “it is still half sheathed in it.” (PS 33-6) In either  case, the rule  of the signifier confines the  interpretation of the  sign  to  a dialectics development caught between “the trap  of the object” and  “the  snare  of the subject”  (PS 36), a logic of interpretation set  in  movement  by  the  gap   that   separates  the  inexhaustible  sign  from   its development in a finite world that is always already to some extent  naturally determined. It is through art that  Proust and  Deleuze seek  to take  a flight  from this world: “[t]he  whole  Search implies a certain  argument between art and  life” (PS 137, 41), insofar  as “art  appears for what  it is, the ultimate goal of life, which life cannot realize  by itself”  and  “[n]ature or life, still too heavy,  have  found in art their spiritual equivalent” (PS 137-8).
