In some  way,  when one thinks of painting that  is called  mannerist, Leibnizâ€™s  entire  philosophy is  without doubt mannerist par excellence.  Already with  Michelangelo one  finds  traces  of a first and  profound mannerism. A mannered posture of Michelangelo is not  an essence.  It is rather the  source  of a modification, the  source of a manner of being.  In this sense,  it is perhaps philosophy which gives  us the  key to a problem in painting, under the form:  what  is mannerism? (07/04/1987).
