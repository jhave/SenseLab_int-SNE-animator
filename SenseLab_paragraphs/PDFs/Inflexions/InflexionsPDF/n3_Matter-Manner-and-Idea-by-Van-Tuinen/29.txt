For if the soul were  like an empty page,  then  truths would be in us in the  way  that  the  shape of Hercules is in  an  uncarved piece  of marble that  is  entirely neutral  as  to  whether it  takes  Hercules’ shape or some  other.  Contrast that  piece of marble with  one that  is veined in a way  that  marks out  the  shape of Hercules rather than other  shapes. This latter  block would be more  inclined to take  that shape than  the  former would, and  Hercules would be  in  a  way innate in it, even  though it would take  a lot of work  to expose  the veins  and   to  polish   them   into  clarity,  removing everything that prevents their  being seen. This is how ideas  and  truths are innate in us – as inclinations, dispositions, tendencies, or natural virtualities [virtualités],   and   not   as  actions;   although  these   virtualities  are always  accompanied  by   certain   actions,   often   insensible  ones, which  correspond to them.24
