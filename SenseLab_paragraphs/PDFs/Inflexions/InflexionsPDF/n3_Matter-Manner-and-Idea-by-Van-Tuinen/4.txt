According to the last verse of his most famous quatrain, Michelangelo Buonarotti held  that “the best artist  has no concept [concetto] which  some single marble does not  potentially enclose   within its  mass,   but  only  the  hand which   obeys  the intellect  [intelletto] can accomplish it.”1  This has often been interpreted in hylomorphic terms  as saying  that  the  content lies waiting within the  marble for its form  to be hewn out.  Such an interpretation is idealist insofar  as it would be the  task  of the  mind to recognize this  content and  of the  hand to merely free it from  the  surrounding mass.  For  Michelangelo, however, it was  not  so simple. When  his  pupil  Benedetto Varchi  complimented him,  “Signor  Buonarroti, you have  the  brain  of a Jove,”  he  responded, “But  Vulcan’s  hammer is required to make  something come out of it.” The passage from the intellectual concetto to the hand that realizes  it entails  more  than  just a passage from the possible to the real, because  the  idea   of  the  whole   composition  must   constantly  be  repeated  or rehearsed in a painstaking process of experimental construction. In the words of de  Tolnay:  “In  a very  real  way  the  primitive form  of the  block  had  a decisive influence on Michelangelo’s imagination. As he became  absorbed in it, the inner image  awoke  in him;  one  can  actually see how  in his  sculptures and  reliefs  he always allowed himself  to be guided by the primitive form  of the  block,  and  in his frescoes by the dimension and  shape of the surfaces at his disposal.”2
