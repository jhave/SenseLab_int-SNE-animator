In Deleuze’s reading, there  is an “almost schizophrenic tension” (TF 33) between the  idealist Leibniz   and   the  realist   Leibniz.   There  is  a  tension, for  example, between the  claim  that  God  chose  a certain  world expressed by the  individual souls  that  populate it and  the claim that  each “windowless” monad freely draws its   perceptions  from   the   folds   of   its   own   infinite,   obscure  or   “virtual”13 background. For it implies that, if an actual  soul is free to hallucinate about  other possible worlds, it must  have  access  to other  perceptions than  those  chosen  by God   which   also  strive   to  existence.   On  the  level  of  actualization,  however, Leibniz  is necessitated to exclude the  reality  of the  possible, since  it is precisely God’s choice  for bringing into  existence  the  actual  world such  as it is expressed by the individual souls  that  must  be defended. Although individual monads are isolated and  spontaneous  insides, each  is  nonetheless bound to  actualize the same  well-founded phenomenon as  do  all  others,  such  that  only  one  possible world is actualized. It is only  on the level of realization, where de jure harmony depends on de facto organic perspective or union of body  and  soul, that  Leibniz allows,  either  within the organic body  or at least open  to it, more  reality  than  the soul  can express by itself. Here  the  infinitely divisible continuum of secondary,
