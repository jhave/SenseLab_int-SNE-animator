Deleuze’s Proustian concept of style  or manner as the  material development of the idea brings  us back to the question of the relation between the eye or intellect as faculty  of ideas  and  the hand as the faculty  of construction. If artistic  ideas  are incorporeal, this does not mean  that  they transcend the corporeal process of their realization. Artistic  signs are neither Platonic  ideas  nor Aristotelian essences,  but immanent causes coextensive and  undergoing qualitative transformations with everything  that   is.   It   is   precisely  non-artistic   signs   that    transcend  their development insofar  as they  possess  a subjective or objective  signification. In art, the   signs   stay   fully   immanent  to  the   style   of  their   technical  development. Everything therefore revolves around  the  great  identity of idea  and  style  – or difference and  repetition – that  makes  art superior to nature, as is reflected also by Bellori’s famous mannerist formula of la maniera, o vogliamo dire fantastica idea, and  by Deleuze’s  statement against Buffon  that  “[s]tyle  is not  the  man,  style  is essence  itself.” (PS 48, 148, TRM 369)
