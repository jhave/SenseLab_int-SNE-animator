In  What  is  Philosophy? (1991)  Deleuze  writes   that,   whereas  philosophy  puts forward concepts, art  makes  blocs  of sensations stand up  on  their  own.  Their distinction coincides with  the duality of form and  matter: “Conceptual becoming is  heterogeneity grasped  in  an  absolute form;  sensory becoming is  otherness caught up in a matter of expression. The monument does not actualize the virtual event  but  incorporates or embodies it: it gives  it a body,  a life, a universe.” (WP
177)  Elsewhere  Deleuze  says  that   it  was  only  with The  Fold. Leibniz  and  the Baroque (1988), hence  with  Leibniz,  that  he was  able  to  “see  better” what  this distinction amounts to. (N 137) As he argues in this book, a form of expression is produced in  a  process of  actualization  whereas  a  matter of  expression  is  a produced in a process of realization. The two  processes are  irreducible to each other,   insofar   as  actualization  relates   to  the   reality   of  the   virtual,  whereas realization relates  to the  existence  of a possible world or universe, “the  possible as aesthetic category” (WP 177). This distinction can help  us to get a better  grasp on the nature of matter.
