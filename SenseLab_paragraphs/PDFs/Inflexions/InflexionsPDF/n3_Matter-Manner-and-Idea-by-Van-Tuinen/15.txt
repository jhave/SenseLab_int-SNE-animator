According  to   Deleuze,  both   Michelangelo  and   Bacon   can   be   qualified  as mannerist insofar  as they  escape  from  classical  figuration not  through Platonic abstraction towards pure  form without matter, as in Mondriaan or Kandinsky, or the rejection  of all form,  as in Fautrier or Pollock,  but  through the “extraction or isolation” of what  Lyotard has  called  the  “figural”: a process of disrupting the link  that  relates  sensation to  an  object  (illustration) or  that  relates  it  to  other images  in a composite whole  which  assigns an  objective  place  to each  of them (narration). Whereas illustration and  narration are established by resemblance or by convention and  thus  bear witness to the dominance of some other  faculty  over sensation, “the  violence  of sensation” in itself consists  not of signifying relations but  of “matters of fact”  devoid of analogy or code.  (FB 4) In Bacon’s paintings, especially the  triptychs from  the  early  1970s that  are  at the  centre  of Deleuze’s analysis,  the  “brutality  of  fact”  means   that   a  figural   “event”  is  “made” or “recorded” in a deformed body  of sensation – “the  body  insofar  as it is flesh or meat”  (FB 22) – which  cannot be reduced to either  an object of reference or the lived    experience  of   a   seeing    subject.
