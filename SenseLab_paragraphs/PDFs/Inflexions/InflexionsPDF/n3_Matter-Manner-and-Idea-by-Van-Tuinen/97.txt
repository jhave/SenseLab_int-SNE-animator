44  This does  not  make  a concept transcendent, as if Deleuze were  a Platonist after all: “The event  might  seem to be transcendent because it surveys the state of affairs,  but it is pure  immanence that  gives it the capacity to survey itself by itself  and  on the  plane.  What  is transcendent, transdescendent, is the  state  of affairs in which  the event  is actualized.” (WP 156)
