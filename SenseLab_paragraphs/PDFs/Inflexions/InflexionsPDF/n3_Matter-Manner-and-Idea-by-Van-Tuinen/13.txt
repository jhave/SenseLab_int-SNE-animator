mano (hand) – proceeds through an  ongoing communication from  eye  to hand and  from  hand to eye,  between possibility of fact and  the  fact itself.  Once  this “frenetic zone  in which  the  hand is no  longer  guided by the  eye  and  is forced upon sight  like  another will”  (FB 137) is  affirmed, the  classical  cliché  of  the creator-genius is replaced by the  properly pictorial experience and  craft  of the artisan  who   becomes   one   with   his   material.  From   this   understanding  of mannerism as  “manual intrusion” (FB 138) it  follows,  firstly,  that  the  artistic vision  of the  idea  is itself  transformed into  a “haptic vision”  (FB 152) or “third eye, replacing the eyes of nature” (C2 265). As Michelangelo says, the aim of art is to “make  of my entire  body  one single  eye”,  such  that  there  is no “part of me not  taking  pleasure in thee!”5  Secondly, it explains why  the  complete execution of  a  work   of  art,   materially  speaking,  is  not   indispensable.  Unfinished  or “infinite” works  of art  such  as the  San Matteo or  the  Prigioni reflect  the  artist’s virtuosity insofar  as they are inseparable from the creative act.6  It is for these  two reasons that  Deleuze claims  that  “[i]t was  with  Michelangelo, with  mannerism, that the Figure  or the pictorial fact was born in its pure  state”.
