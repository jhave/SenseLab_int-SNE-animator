The only occasion  at which  Deleuze explicitly refers  to Michelangelo is in Francis Bacon.  The  Logic  of  Sensation  (1981),  in  which   his   suggestion  is  that   with mannerism there  appears for the first time “a properly pictorial atheism”. (FB 9) In 15th century classicism  the prevailing image  of art prescribed that art’s task lies in the imitation of beauty found in nature as a divine product. In the 16th-century the  principle of  fantastica idea appogiata alla pratica e non  all’imitazione (Bellori) came   to  serve   a  confrontation between  nature  and   artistic   creativity  and   a valuation of style  or  maniera over  nature. Thus  whereas Leone  Battista  Alberti warned the  artist  against placing too much  trust  in his genius, advising him  to confine  himself  to the great  model that  is created nature, Michelangelo relied  on his ingegno, the  power of his artistic  mind to improve nature instead of merely imitating it, for example to extract  from a Carrara mountain top the colossus  that is hermetically confined in it.4
