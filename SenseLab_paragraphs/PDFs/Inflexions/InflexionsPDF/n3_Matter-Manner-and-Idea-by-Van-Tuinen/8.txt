In a lecture  at the FEMIS film school in 1987, Deleuze equates the question ‘What is a creative act?’ with  that  of ‘What does  it mean  to have  an idea?’. “Ideas,” he argues,  “have   to  be  treated like  potentials  already  engaged in  one  mode   of expression or another and  inseparable from  the  mode  of expression, such  that  I cannot say that I have an idea in general.” (TRM 312) Artists  are “seers” or “visionaries” who  have  an intuition of the  virtual dimension of things, yet their ideas  differ from Plato’s eternal ideas insofar  as they have no existence  outside of the actual  work  of art and  hence  do not preside over life but become  coextensive with  it. Hence  already in Proust and Signs (1964), which  appeared just before  the hey-days of the so-called  ‘dematerialization of art’, Deleuze had  written that  the idea is “hewn out of our life” and  “delivered in a work”.
