concrete “manual aggregate” (FB 130) without the latter  transcending the former through subjectivity or objectivity, such  that  the  consistency or formal  structure of this composition is entirely constituted by the manner in which  the disparate elements are combined. Art therefore not only makes  up philosophy’s non- philosophical extension, but  we  can  also  discover in  Michelangelesque figures the formal  structure of monadic essences  or Leibnizian concepts: “One  shall  call mannerist a philosophical conception or  pictorial vision  which  characterizes a being  by its manners.” (CGD 20/01/1987) This is indeed the great  theme  of The Fold,  namely  that   the   monad’s   perceptions  resemble  matter  as  a  form   of producing it “in extension” (TF 96): “Material matter makes  up  the  bottom, but folded forms  are  styles  or  manners. We  go  from  matter to  manner”, or  with Dubuffet, “from the Texturologie to the Logologie” (TF 35).
