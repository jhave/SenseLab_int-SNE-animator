6 As Charles de Tolnay  has argued, whereas the imagine del cor is superior to the finished work,  the unfinished work  communicates a fragmentary whole  of which the  unfinishedness derives not  from  external limits  or too  large  ambitions, but from  an inner  necessity, from  a certain  inexhaustible potentiality ‘power’ of the material itself:  “This  argument suggests that  Michelangelo must  certainly have regarded his  incomplete statues as unfinished works,  because his  artistic  ideal was founded on the power of the relievo. He did  not complete his statues, in spite of this, because in so doing he would have lessened their  lyric intensity.” (Tolnay
1964, 95)
