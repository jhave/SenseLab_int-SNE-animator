Just like matter is no longer  merely a content but  a material capable of realizing possible worlds beyond natural preformation, Deleuze holds  that  form  is a form of expression virtually including all possible worlds. In art, the act of invention is inseparably caught up  within the medium in which  it propagates or diffuses its point  of view.  If philosophy possesses its own  abstract ‘material’ and  can be distinguished  from   the   bodily   aggregate  of  affects   and   perceptions  in   “a
‘modern’ fashion” (PS 98), it must  therefore break  with the figural  and find a way of giving  consistency to “finite  forms”  (WP 75) whilst  upholding the movement of  the  infinite   without any  misplaced  concreteness. The  concept  is  certainly grounded in existence  and  hence  in affects  and  percepts – for as Leibniz  knew well, “the most abstract thoughts are in need  of some sense perception”42 –, but if a sensory becoming-other has  to  be  realized in  a material state  of affairs,  the concept gives consistency to an otherness of an incorporeal nature. Deleuze calls the  consistency of this “heterogeneity grasped in an absolute form”  “event”: an entirely incorporeal entity  which  surveys its components at infinite  speed and  in a perfectly pre-individual state,  a manner abstracted from  the slow  concreteness of  an  always already  to  some   extent   individuated  or  organized  matter.43  If philosophy is truly  different from  art  yet  capable of sharing with  it the  same mannerist diagram or idea,  this  is therefore because art  records the  event  in a generic  and  dynamic bodily  extension that  selects  and  imitates possible worlds, whereas the  event  itself  is a  virtual “intension” extracted from  the  immanent structure of the  idea  not  through selection and  imitation, but  immediately, as a direct  and  unmediated intuition of pure  immanent becoming.44
