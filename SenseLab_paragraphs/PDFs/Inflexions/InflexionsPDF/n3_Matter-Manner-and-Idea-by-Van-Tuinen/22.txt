Back to Deleuze’s definition of art. Following Leibniz’s distinction between appetition and  perception, Deleuze says  that  a possible world is embodied in a compound of affects  and  percepts. (WP 164) Affects  and  percepts, however, are not  the  same  as affections or perceptions, because they  are  not  reducible to an individual form  whose  lived  organic experience they  are. Already for Leibniz,  a body   can  possess   a  substantive  consistency without  being   individual,  since although organs are the  perceptual-affective requirement of the development of the  life of the individual monad to which  a body  belongs, the  reverse is not  the case. Other  material compositions reflecting other,  non-subjective or monstrous sensations are always possible. Only reasonable monads have  a so-called “substantializing bond  (vinculum  substantiale)” attached to them  by which,  like a “judgment of God”,  the organic compositions are morally bound to their unchanging foundations, whereas bodies  belonging to animal souls are subject to continuous metamorphoses, that  is, they  can always be developed into  different possible worlds and  thus  into new  aggregates of sensation.16 Each sensation thus “exists  in  its  possible universe without  the  concept necessarily existing   in  its absolute form.”  (WP 178) Spinoza’s  observation is therefore valid  for Leibniz  as well  – we  do  not  yet  know  what  sensations a body  is capable of: “Even  when they  are  nonliving, or rather inorganic, things have  a lived  experience because they  are percepts and  affects.”17 (WP 154, translation modified) Hence Michelangelo’s preference to speak  of “alpine and  living  stone”  or of “the  living figure  in alpine  and  hard rock”18  that  outlives its maker,  or Deleuze’s claims that blocs of sensation possess  the autonomous and  inorganic life of “nonhuman becomings” and  “nonhuman landscapes” (WP 169) and  that  the model of all art
