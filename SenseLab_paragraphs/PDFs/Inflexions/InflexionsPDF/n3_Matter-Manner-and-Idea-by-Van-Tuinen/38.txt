The identity of essence  and  style  over  and  against their  classical  opposition – in which  the  singularity of the  latter  has  almost  always been  subordinated to the first  – takes  us  to  a third Leibnizian theme  in Deleuze’s understanding of Michelangelo: monadic individuation.  In Proust and Signs Deleuze argues that artistic  “essences are veritable monads”, since each essence  refers  to an ultimate difference inseparable from  its “manner” of expressing the world.34 Then,  in The Fold, he  contrasts Leibniz  to  Descartes insofar  as  the  first  replaces the  latter’s classical  essentialism with  a  “mannerism of  substances” (TF  57): “Classicism needs  a solid  and  constant attribute for substance, but  mannerism is fluid,  and the spontaneity of manners replaces the essentiality of the attribute.” (TF 56)
