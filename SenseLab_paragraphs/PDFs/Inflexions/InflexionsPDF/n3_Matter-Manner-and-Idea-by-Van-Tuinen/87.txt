35   See  the   eighth  thesis   of  the   “Discourse  on   Metaphysics”:  “That   every individual substance expresses the whole  universe in its own manner and  that  in its full concept is included all its experiences together with  all the attendant circumstances and  the  whole  series  of exterior events.” (L 307) In Difference and Repetition,  Deleuze  refers   to  this   procedure  of  extracting  essences   from   the inessential in terms  of “orgiastic representation”: “The concept thus  follows  and espouses determination in all its metamorphoses, from one end  to the other,  and represents it  as  pure   difference” (DR  42) and   hence  “it  is  the  infinite   which renders determination conceivable and  selectable:  difference thus  appears as the orgiastic representation  of  determination and  no  longer  as  its  organic representation.” (DR 43)
