32 Deleuze quotes Proust:  “‘One can string  out in indefinite succession, in a description, the objects which  figured in the described place; the truth will begin only  when the writer takes  two  different objects, posits  their  relation, analogous in the world of art to that  of the causal  law in the world of science, and  envelops them   in  the  necessary  rings   of  a  great   style.’”  (cit  PS  47)  In  Difference and Repetition, this  is explained in terms  of “the  disparity of style”  (DR 214), which disappears in the repetition of an original difference, not in the reproduction of a simple  motif:  “In  the  repetition of a decorative motif,  a figure  is reproduced, while  the  concept remains absolutely identical … . However, this  is not  how artists  proceed in reality.  They do not juxtapose instances of the figure,  but rather each time combine an element of one instance with another element of a following instance.   They    introduce   a   disequilibrium   into    the    dynamic   forces    of construction, an instability, dissymmetry or gap  of some  kind  which  disappears in the overall  effects.” (DR 20)
