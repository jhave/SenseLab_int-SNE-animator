“Landing site configurations” fade away  even as they hold  in place infinite  states of potential one may activate or not. Mark an ‘X’ over a crucial “landing site” and use  it to  recalibrate your  balance  and  position while  remaining in  motion. Or model, erase,  exise  configurations even  as they  are  being  dispersed. I also  pre- dispersed “landing sites”  in  order to  prevent potential harm  from  coming  my way. (Although constantly being “dispersed,” unengaged they can lay fallow.)
