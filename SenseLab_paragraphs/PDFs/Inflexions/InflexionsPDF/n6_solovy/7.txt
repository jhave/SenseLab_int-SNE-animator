One of the remarkable values  of their  work  is its adaptability to the skills of each practitioner. Not  just  for  the  agile,  it  challenges the  adventurous to  invent.  I believe  the momentous philosophical and  aesthetic implications must  be viewed alongside  testimonies  of  “accidental”  architectural  bodies.   Let  us  hear   from survivors of war  or natural disasters. Team  a philosopher with  a soldier and  a doctor to create  a new  kind  of procedural dialogue. Or compare attentiveness of pain/endurance based  performance artists  to the attentiveness of protracted traumatic  pain   patients,  asking   questions  relating  to  “landing  sites,” “terminological junctions,” “bioscleave,” which   trace  the process  of the body  in its   messy,   inelegant,  stuttering   physicality  on   its   way   to      becoming an Architectural Body.
