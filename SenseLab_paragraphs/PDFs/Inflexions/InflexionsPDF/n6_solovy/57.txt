Pain
A.-F.  Pain  has  landed everywhere. Layering and  summing up  of surroundings does   not  offer  useful   information.  Potential  “landing  sites”   arrive   strangely because of synesthesia, personification, muddled  up  senses,  constant  motion; I cannot   count  on  their  veracity. Without sited  awareness, I make  many  failed attempts to “link up with a feature or element” to form “landing sites.”
