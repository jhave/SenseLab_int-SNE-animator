Blur into Blank (Blank within Blur)
D.-F. A very  potent concept  in the work  of Arakawa and  Gins is, “the  blank…” which  they  characterize as: “a preverbal state  that  precedes creation…an event preceding language…Blank is not emptiness, it is what  fills emptiness…it gives a diffuse,  blurring power to consciousness in conjunction with  narrowly focused delineations of intentions” (Arakawa and Gins 1997: 134).
