Part  by part,  organ  by organ  I tried  to name  myself  back into my body,  to make real,  body  and  world, each  manifesting each,  naming was  landing. By naming (thinking names, later  pronouncing) I continued to manifest world, a continuous vigil, spotting, sensing and  saying  to preserve life: naming “landing sites” as affirmations   of   organism-person-surround,   fanning  out    farther   and    then suddenly retracting into blackness for indeterminate periods of time, building on leg, eye, etc., thereby landing/manifesting body  in world.
