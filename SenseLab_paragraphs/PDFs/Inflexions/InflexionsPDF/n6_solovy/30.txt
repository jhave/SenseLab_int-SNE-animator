H.  Kabbalists define  death as “the  inability to overcome inner  inertia.” If that  is the  case,  I knew  I was  dying or  perhaps already dead. I discovered that  the “division” between “life”  and   “death” is  much   more   ephemeral, even  more malleable than  I ever  knew.  Oddly, like  remembering, dying is an  activity,  a verb,  something people do. As I lost ability  to form  world (myself  in the  world and   the  world  itself,)  death-pull  was   the  first  “landing  site”   I  greeted—by resisting it.  I  repeatedly decided to  try  not  to  die.  I  fought to  manifest the organism-person-surround, even  when it seemed there  was  no  self (organism- person) to  engage surround and/or  too  much   or  too  little  surround (world/”bioscleave”) around.
