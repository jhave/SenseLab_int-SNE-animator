Screaming forced  me to bypass all familiar modes of functioning, not only establishing “new  relationships between agency  and  activity” but   creating new event  configurations on-the-spot in newly  discovered (to me) fields with  which  I might  eventually partner to  reunite self with  world. The screams created “audial landing sites”  in-waiting, holding open  not  only  points of contact  but, “approximative-rigorous abstractions,” which  “continuously keep posing the question of what  it is that  in  its  name  has  been  and  is still  being  abstracted” (Arakawa and   Gins  2006: 57)  and   “terminological junctions”:  “places   where language itself might  again  be possible while  keeping vivid  the multiple scales of action that are in operation as the world” (74).
