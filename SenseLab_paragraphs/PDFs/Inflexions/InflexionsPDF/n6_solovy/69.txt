I also  knew  I needed to  begin  to  pin  myself  back  on  world, to  find  points at which  I could  attach  myself  before  being  swallowed up,  the first step  would be simple  adhesion. Just  as blur  yielded blank,  blank  was  pierced by a point  that read   as  a  Hebrew letter,   Yud,  the  tiniest   letter,   said  to  expand the  force  of compassion; associated with building space and dimension.
