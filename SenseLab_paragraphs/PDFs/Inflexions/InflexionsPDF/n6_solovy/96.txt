We  chose  to  see  the  experience as  an  animate shape,   which  also  became  the shape  of our  awareness. When  we  realized the  surround was  in  constant and unpredictable motion, we also realized that  we had  to strive  to stay in motion, as well to, for example, neutralize the (force of) windshield speeding toward me/us through space  and  shattering the  motion and  shape  of its own  freshly  created form, “instantly” revised by the body  / bodies  it hit and so on.
