I could  have  experienced Event  #1 only,  and  not  moved into  Events  #2 and  #3 and  I might  have  died  or sustained much  worse  injuries.   On the other  hand, if I had  been  a more  highly  functional “architectural body,” I might  have  sustained fewer injuries  or even walked away  unscathed.
