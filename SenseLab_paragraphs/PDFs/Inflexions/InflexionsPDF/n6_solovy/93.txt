Each  body   was  single-tasked and  the  all  the  activities went   through / were directed by the host body  but it was the community of bodies  that  allowed “me” to  survive,” intermingling senses  easily  for  function and  even  pleasure. Many took pain,  some did not. If one crashed, say, into the windshield, its twin acted as its “protector.” Some were  responsible to field scale or distance; some  managed “cleaving” and  connection with  “bioscleave,” some  able to see what  was coming next, guarding others  to the best of their ability.
