Arakawa and  Gins  challenge us to reconceive the way  we construct perception, to “knit,  explode and  weave  the  world’s occurrence” (Arakawa and  Gins  2002:
60-1). The continuously evolving shapes, slopes,  diagonals, planes, horizons and
everything in-between, posed by  the  car  smashing as  it hit  my  moving body, compelled me  to  form  new  kinds   of  attentiveness.  This  paper will  begin  to suggest originative help  for problems like brain  injuries,  post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, addiction and trauma.
