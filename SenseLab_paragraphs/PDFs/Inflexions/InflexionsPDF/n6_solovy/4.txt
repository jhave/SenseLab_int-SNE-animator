Still on  crutches five  years  later,  I met  Madeline Gins  and  Arakawa. Instantly clear   were   the   similarities  between  my   life-saving  improvisations  and   the visionary  procedural  architecture  they   have   created during  their   35+  years practice. As a matter of fact, I do  not  think  there  is one  activity  I accomplished that  does  not  in  some  way  affirm  their  project,  starting with  early  painting, installation, and  poetry, through the  abundant manifestations of procedural architecture and literary works.
