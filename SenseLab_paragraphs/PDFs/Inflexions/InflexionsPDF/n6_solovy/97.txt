The   architect  Greg   Lynn,   who   was   interviewed  in   the   Reversible  Destiny Exhibition catalogue, favors  what  he calls “animate design”:  “the  co-presence of motion  and   force  at  the   moment  of  formal   conception…Force  is  an  initial condition, the  cause  of  both  motion and   the  particular  inflections of  a  form defined by multiple interacting vectors…unfolding in time”  (Lynn 1999: 11).
