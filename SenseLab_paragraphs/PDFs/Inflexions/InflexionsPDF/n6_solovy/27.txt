C.-E. No sense of body  separate from worldâ€”boundaries permeable. Everything as  everything  undifferentiated.  Sensory,   spatial,  temporal,  material,  spiritual input twists,   fuses,  leaks,  bashes   together creating a  nauseating supra/hyper animate sensory blur  periodically interrupted by a solid  black  void.  Event-field intense, very  small  and  close to body,  the most  contracted space  imaginable. No dimension or depth of field. All near-near ground.
