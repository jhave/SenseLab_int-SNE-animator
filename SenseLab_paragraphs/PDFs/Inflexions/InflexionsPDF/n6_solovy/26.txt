B.-G. No cognitive scales of action.  Scale has “lost its traction on sited  awareness and  the  process  of venturing forth  has  completely blurred nearground, middleground  and   farground”  (Arakawa  and   Gins   2002:  76).  Almost    no perceptive and/or proprioceptive skills. Barely functioning on a cellular  level of awareness.
