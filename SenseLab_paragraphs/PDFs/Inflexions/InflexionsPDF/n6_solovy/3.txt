Five years  before I was introduced to the work  of Arakawa + Gins, I was hit by a car going  40 mph.  According to medical authorities, I should have  been killed  or severely  crushed  but   I  managed  to   survive  numerous  potential  crises   by improvising peculiar moves,  sitings,  and  projections, solving  problems not even being  imagined, let alone  addressed by medical teams.  Many  of these  activities saved  my life, organs, brain, eyes, and ability to speak  and walk again.
