Though the  accident continuously stirred up  many  plausible (and  implausible) “domains of indeterminacy,” all three  types  of “landing sites”  were  cast out and greeted in many  configurations, zones and fields. I / we / they were able to be as far or near as we deemed necessary, “rerouting landing site dispersal.” The “raw process” of venturing forth  was  clarified,  even  in  this  chaotic  situation, as  we were  able  to  construct multiple vantage points, tipping rather than   violently rotating, spongy, pliant rather than  steep  and  angular forms  and  motion. We not only  saw  the  seeing,  heard the  hearing, etc., we saw  the  seers  seeing,  heard the hearers hearing.
