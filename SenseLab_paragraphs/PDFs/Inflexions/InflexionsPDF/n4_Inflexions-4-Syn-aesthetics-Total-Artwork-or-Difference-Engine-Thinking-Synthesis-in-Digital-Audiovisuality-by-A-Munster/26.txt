In the work  of Nicolai,  Robin Fox, Ryoichi Kurakawa and  others,  in festivals  such as the  yearly  Cimatics audiovisual extravaganza, in VJing and  in the  curation of digital art into exhibitions such as See this Sound, in Linz, the senses  are getting a work  around.3   Weaving its way through these  various events  and  performances is a concept that  intermittently pops  up within aesthetics: synaesthesia.  Thought about  the synaesthetic has traversed both artistic  composition and  scientific approaches to human perception â€“ artists  and  writers such as Rimbaud, Rimsky- Korsakov, Scriabin,  Messaien and  so on have  been  labeled as possible or actual neuro-synaesthetes (van Campen, 1997; Harrison and  Baron-Cohen, 1997). Twentieth century  artists   such  as  Kandinsky and   Cardew have   suggested  a necessary conjunction  particularly of the  visual  and  the  sonic;  that  art  made  in one necessarily calls up the other  sensory modality.
