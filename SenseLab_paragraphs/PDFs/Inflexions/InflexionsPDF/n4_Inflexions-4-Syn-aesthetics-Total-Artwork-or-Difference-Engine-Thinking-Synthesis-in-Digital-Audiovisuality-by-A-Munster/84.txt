6  The Studio  for Electronic  Music  was  founded by Hans  Hartmann, the director of West German Radio  in Cologne in 1953. Members of the Groupe pour Musique Concrète, which   included  Stockhausen, used   it  to  experiment with   electronic sound using  various analogue and  early digital synthesisers.
