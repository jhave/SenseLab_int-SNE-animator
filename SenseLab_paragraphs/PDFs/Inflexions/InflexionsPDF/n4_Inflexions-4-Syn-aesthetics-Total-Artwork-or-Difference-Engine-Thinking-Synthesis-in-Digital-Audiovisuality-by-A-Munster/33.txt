response  to  a  perceptual  stimulus  (Cytowic,  1997:  23;  Ramachandran  and Hubbard, 2001: 4).  Neurological research into  synaesthesia can be ’sorted’ into two  prevailing  approaches:  on  the  one  hand, the  idea   that   ordinary neural
‘pruning’ in human development fails to occur leaving in place an originary synaesthetic brain;  and  on  the  other,  the  idea  that  different sensory modalities and  their  functions are located in separated areas  or modules of the brain,  which are ‘cross-activated’ in synaesthetes.
