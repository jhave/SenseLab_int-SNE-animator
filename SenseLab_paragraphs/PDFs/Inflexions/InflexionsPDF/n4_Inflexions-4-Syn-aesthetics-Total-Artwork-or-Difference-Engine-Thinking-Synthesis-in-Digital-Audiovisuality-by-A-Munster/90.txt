10  For general information about  the MAX/MSPJitter environment, see the Cycling’74  website at  http://cycling74.com/products/maxmspjitter/.     In particular the  page  on  ‘control’  is interesting.   As  will  be  seen  from  a typical segment of a MAX ‘patch’ on this page,  although the software proclaims its ease of control,  this is because, as it says, ‘everything is connected to everything.’  See the  following page  on  the  website: http://cycling74.com/products/maxmspjitter/control/.   Effectively,    then, control  is less  about  a command line  algorithm in this  environment and  more about  the capacity for anything to become  a controller, that  is, for any module of the customized environment to modulate any other  module.
