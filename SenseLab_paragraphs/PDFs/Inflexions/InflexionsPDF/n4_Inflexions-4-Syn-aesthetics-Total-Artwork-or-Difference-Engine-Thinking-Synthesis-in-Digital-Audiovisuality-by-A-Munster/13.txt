process of binding the  varying elements. Interfacial synthesis becomes  the  pre- given   ground  upon  which   multi-mediated  sound,  image,   text   and   so   on magically melt,  one  into  the  other.    The  role  of the  computer in  the  Wagner- multimedia genealogy is to stage  the  immediate and  transparent passing of all transcoded sensory elements into  each  other  such  that  synthesis miraculously occurs.    The coded environment breathes as the  contemporary incarnation of a whole  that has transcended its own senses.
