But there  is a more  general discussion of synaesthesia as a phenomenon of contemporary audiovisual spaces,  as  if,  somehow, the  digital and  perception have    become    necessary   compossibles.      This   hinges    on   the    idea    of   a fundamentally connective analogue sometimes implicit,  sometimes explicit between the neural and  the digital. Although this connection opens  up a number of interesting possibilities around the concept of plasticity, it also suggests a slide into the reified  model of wiring.  Prominent neurological conceptions of the synaesthetic and  models of the  movement and  flows  of data  through software and  information architecture such as the database converge.  For example, Christopher Cox’s analysis of Nicolai’s telefunken draws together synaesthetic experience with digital/electronic signal:
