Thus  the spectator transplants himself  upon the stage,  by means  of all his  visual  and  aural  faculties;  while  the  performer becomes  an artist  only by complete absorption into the public.   Everything, that breathes and  moves  upon the stage,  thus  breathes and  moves  alone from  eloquent desire  to impart, to be seen  and  heard within those walls  which,  however circumscribed their  space,  seem  to the  actor from his scenic standpoint to embrace the whole  of humankind; whereas the  public,   that  representative of  daily   life,  forgets   the confines  of the auditorium, and  lives and  breathes now  only in the artwork which  seems  to  it as  Life itself,  and  on  the  stage  which seems the wide  expanse of the whole  World  (Wagner, 1895: 186).
