It’s  a  stinking hot  day  in  mid-July  in  Venice,  literally.   The  mosaic  stench  of refuse,  algae  and  petrol  fuelling the  vaporettos rises  visibly,  up  off  the  city’s tepid canals.   I am  here  for the  52nd  Biennale  of the  Arts,  2007, and,  like many
‘art’  tourists, the  parklands of the  Giardinni, housing the  participating nations’ pavilions and  première artists,  provide some  air-conditioned respite.  Here  the footsore can disentangle that  particular criss-crossing of sensory boundaries that unravels when navigating the Veneto.   I head  for the Russian pavilion: not only does   it  hint   at  an  associated  coldness  but   in  publicity  announcements  I’ve already discovered that  this year  Russia’s  theme  is the relation between ‘the real world and  technology’.  Nothing colder.   An eight-metre water tank greets  me on entry,   with   a  rhythm  pulsating  along   its  length.

Suddenly,  the   sensation  of   cold,   purified  water  is everywhere, gliding over my sweaty limbs.

At the same time and  relentlessly, each ‘view’ is replaced by an image  of water, which  is relentlessly replaced by a ‘view’, which  is wiped away…
