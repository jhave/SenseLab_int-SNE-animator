Ryoichi  Kurokawa’s digital cross-processing audiovisual sculptures and performances crop up in festivals,  clubs, art galleries and  music  video.   He is a VJ but  one  who  is less  interested in image  for music  than  in  experimenting with what  we  might  call relational sculpture.   The  term  ‘relational  sculpture’  is my paraphrasing of  the  term   ‘animated  sculpture’,  which   can  be  found in  Erin Manning’s  analysis of David  Spriggs’  work  (2009: 143–50).   Manning suggests that  these  ‘sculptural  objects’  draw us  in  to  the  ‘seeing’  of the  force  of visual perception as we move  around them,  expecting, but not quite  making out, bodily forms within their glass cases.  The sculpture itself is not animated; rather it is the relation that  the  relational sculpture-viewer assemblage triggers between visual perception and  movement that  comprises the  animation.  An  animation of the virtual in/of  perception.  Similar,  perhaps, to what  Olafur  Elliason  has  said  in relation to the aesthetic problematic that animates his work  – the seeing  of seeing or the sensing of sensing (2004).
