sonority perhaps rendering audible something that  is inaudible: changes in electrical   current as  it  is  conducted through the  materiality of  the  transistor. Notably, voltage controlled synthesizers are analogue in terms  of the signal  and in terms  of the ways  in which  an electronic signal  acts upon another; that is continuously variable.  But there  are elements of the design and  of the hardware that also make  this kind  of synthesizer a precursor to digital instruments  – specifically its use of modular design and  of transistor devices.  Importantly, too, this  very  design of  a  ‘control  line’  for  passing signal   through the  system is cybernetic insofar  as it sets up an architecture for one pass or feed of information to pass  or feed  into  another layer  of information.  But it is more  than  cybernetic once   the   ‘control   layer’   becomes    digital,  effectively    allowing  many   more operations upon operations and,  what  is more,  allowing these  operations to shift from  the  status of ‘force’  to that  of ‘execution’.   In the  digital synthesizer, this
‘control layer’ is not itself a force but rather becomes  removed from the actions  of forces,  from  forces’  affectivities  (the  way  forces  affect  and   are  affected).     In becoming executable (executive, perhaps) it turns algorithmic.
