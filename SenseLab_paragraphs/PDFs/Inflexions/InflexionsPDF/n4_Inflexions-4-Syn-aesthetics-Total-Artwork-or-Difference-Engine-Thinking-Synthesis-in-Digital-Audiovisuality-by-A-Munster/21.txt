music  – that  form in which  music  connects theatre, language, architecture, dance and  visuality.    This  total  offering  up  of the  arts  in the  dramaturgical Gesamtkunstwerk   was   to  provide  the   opportunity  for   audiences  to  connect directly to all senses  at once and  hence,  in Wagner’s view,  to nature (1895: 188–
193).  Music in Wagnerian opera  was intended to provide a mobilizing force for unification and  it is in this that  a particular kind  of meta-synthesis is found. But the  question  of  passing as  a  process  of  relation,  of  something  passing  into something else is passed over here in favour of immersion.
