Interestingly enough the programming environments for much  cross-signal audiovisual  processing in  software such  as  MAX/MSPJitter  deploys a  ‘patch bay’ diagram in which  signal  flow is directed in and  out of processes such as filtering.10   A number of VJing packages such as GridPro alternatively use a kind of array  interface in which  signals  are ‘sent’ places  via circuitous routes in order to interact with  each  other.   So although there  are plenty of algorithms working away  crunching the  signal  and  executing effects  what  seems  to  have  been  left behind in the cross-processing environment is the architecture of the control  line. This is not to say that  there  is not a lot of data  instructing other  data  what  to do. Is this the re-appearance of a meta-form in the guise of meta-data?
