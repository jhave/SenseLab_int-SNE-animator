We could  of course  imagine algorithms as something different from  operations that execute  functions of code and  as new condensations of forces. As Adrian MacKenzie has suggested, algorithms are complex condensations of code and sociality  in which  what  is ‘ordered’  is already subjected  to a certain  epistemic setting into place, an ‘ordering’ of things by their  place, by their  time (2006: 44).
