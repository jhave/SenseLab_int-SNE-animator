However, the  debate moved into  somewhat different territory during the  1990s with  the  emergence of both  ‘environments’ that  were  art works,  such  as virtual reality  art, the dominance of video  installation at biennales and  festivals  and  the art criticism  of Nicolas  Bourriard’s ‘relational aesthetics’ (See Nicolas  Bourriard, Relational Aesthetics,  Paris:  Les  Presse   Du  Reel,  1998).  Bourriard  emphasizes notions  such   as  participation  and   interaction  as  key  aspects  of  twenty-first century art: neither object nor  concept is crucial,  instead the ‘experience’ counts.
