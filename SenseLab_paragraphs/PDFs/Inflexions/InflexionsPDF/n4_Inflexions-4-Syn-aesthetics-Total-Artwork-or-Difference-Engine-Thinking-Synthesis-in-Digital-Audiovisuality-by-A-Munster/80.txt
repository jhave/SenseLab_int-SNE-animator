4 It should be clear that  the aim of this essay  is not to provide an explanation for synaesthesia as a neurological phenomenon.  However, this does  raise  the issue of  why   it  is  that   synaesthesia  as  thought  neurologically requires  a  causal explanation as such.   If, for example, an ontogentic approach were  to be adopted by neurologists (following Simondon), synaesthesia might  simply sit within a spectrum or continuum of human perception as a potential mode  through which perception individuates.  Synaesthesia would already be part  of the ontogenetic field  of  human perception;  one  of  its  potentialities.   To  a  certain   extent,   the concept  of   neuroplasticity  (ie  that   the   brain   is  in   a   constant  relation  of neurobiologcal formation with  its milieu),  which  is now becoming more  accepted within the  neurosciences, holds  out  the  possibility that  a more  ontogenetically inclined mode  of thinking might  permeate this field.  If the brain is process rather than  entity  – suggested by the  neuroplastic notion that  neurobiological change can and  does consistently occur – then  this might  also suggest that perception too is no longer  an ‘outcome’ caused by certain  wirings of the neural pathways.  For a good  and  accessible  overview of neuroplasticity, see Norman Doidge, The Brain That Changes Itself:  Stories of Personal Triumph  from the Frontiers of Brain Science, New  York: Penguin, 2007.
