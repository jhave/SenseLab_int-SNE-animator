Modular systems dealing with  the organization of electronic systems were  on the rise during the 1960s.  Together with  hardware such  as transistor devices,  entire systems for electronic sound synthesis could  be packaged in smaller more transportable units  that  were  customized but  mutually compatible (Manning,
2004: 101–5).  Filters  and  oscillators could  be put  together to synthesize the  one sound  simultaneously.    Previously sound  synthesizers  featured  sliders   and knobs  where the  electronic signal  was  processed at one  point,  synthesized and then   passed down  the  signal   line  to  the  next  point   of  synthesis.    So,  first oscillated,  then   filtered  for   example.    However  now   the   system  could   be designed so that  an external set of voltage characteristics could  control  the signal outside its passing from  one process to another.  This allowed a secondary set of interconnections to produce the control  information for any of the individual modules, creating the beginnings of a meta-data or ‘control’ layer  of data,  which acted  upon the signal  allowing it to be processed in a way specific to the forces of those  actions  (that is, the particular set of voltage characteristics).
