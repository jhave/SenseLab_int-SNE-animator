The  chill  rising   up   through my  bones   comes   from   the  orchestration  of  the aesthetic and  political  dimensions of this  work,  which  mesh  so brilliantly and evoke   for   me   everything  that   is  truly   chilling   about   contemporary  digital aesthetics.  Here  digital art’s  cultural signals  are  cross-processed with  a proto- fascist politics.   This installation, so overwhelmingly immersive and  epic, at once strips  its audience of complex sensory engagement with  its world.  We are left to slouch  against the  wall  and  submit instead to its total  spectacle.  The  world it evokes  is one  of violence  without force.   Its models are characters in battle  with each other,  using  weapons borrowed from gaming; rockets  perpetually launch in the background; the models loop  through endless gestures of bloodless, yet relentless, conflict.    This  is  anaesthesia – the  nonsensing  space  of  mainstream digital visual  culture – a flat space that, as Last Riot intimates, is also synonymous with  the contemporary politics  of perpetual war.
