11  The  concept of metadata has  been  around for  about  40 years  and  was  first coined  and  then  trademarked as Metadata by Jack E. Myers  in 1973.  In general, computer and  information scientists and  librarians agree  that  it is data  about other  data  and  that  it is linked associatively to that  other  data  both  temporally and  spatially, as for example with  ‘tags’ that  provide keyword semantic descriptions of web  content.  In general computational terms,  metadata handles and  locates  this ‘other data’  in a more  efficient  way  so that  the bulk  of the other data  does  not have  to be processed.  Its position is not entirely clear, though, as other  data  can  become  metadata too and  from  the  point  of view  of processing, metadata is just  data!
