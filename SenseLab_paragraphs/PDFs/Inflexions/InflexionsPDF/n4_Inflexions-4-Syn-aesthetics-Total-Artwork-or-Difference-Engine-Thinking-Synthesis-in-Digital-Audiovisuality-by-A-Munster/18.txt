synthetic aesthetic of Last Riot is recursively produced across a number of planes. The most obvious can be found in the digital scenography, compositing beautiful live models into computationally synthetic backgrounds, blending all into a synthetic world.  There  is also  a fusing  of variable aesthetics through bringing together  the   digital  image   and   palette  with   the   Romantic  compositions  of Wagner.   Synthesis is likewise performed across  the  senses  via  the  particular spatialization of  the  installation in  the  Russian pavilion,  which,   in  its  screen tryptych, lands  the  public  inside  a hallowed architecture, somewhere between altar  and  IMAX.  A body’s sense  of this space  in relation to all these  syntheses is of being  brought in to (immersion) the  already synthesised; of inhabiting a pre- given   mesh   of  digital and   lens-based  media,  colour   palette and   epic  audio. There’s little room  to move.
