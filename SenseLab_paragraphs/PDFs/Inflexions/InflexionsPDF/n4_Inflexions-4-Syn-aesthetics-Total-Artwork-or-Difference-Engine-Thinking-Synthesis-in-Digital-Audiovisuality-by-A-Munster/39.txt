In  the  living  being,  individuation  is brought about by the individual itself, and  is not simply a functioning object that  results from an individuation already accomplished, comparable to the  product of a manufacturing  process.   The  living  being  resolves its  problems not  simply by  adapting itself    which   is  to  say  by  modifying its relation to a milieu  (something a machine is equally able  to do)  – but by modifying itself through the invention of new  internal structures…The living individual is a system of individuation, an individuating  system  and also a system  that  individuates  itself (Simondon, 1992: 305; original emphasis).
