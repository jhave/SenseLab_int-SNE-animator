There  are two  main  competing neurological hypotheses for synaesthesia: Cross- Modal  Transfer (CMT) and  Neonatal Synaesthesia (NS).   One  derives from  the other   but  makes   more   radical   neurological claims.     The  CMT  hypothesis is slightly older  and  was developed as a result  of work  by Meltzoff and Borton who posited that infants have the ability  to recognize objects in more  than  one sensory modality (1979).   So, for example, something that  a baby  has  only  touched can nonetheless be visually recognised by it. The  process involved in this  infantile experience involves the transfer of sensory ‘data’ across modes – haptic  to visual. Visual  recognition is  here  understood as  something  that  must   exist  prior   to intermodal processes.  The process is possible because of the infantile brain’s cognitive ability  to abstract representations from objects. It is this capacity for abstraction that  points to where joining  – the ’syn’ – of all the sensory modalities occurs.    The  CMT  hypothesis rests  upon the  proposition that  synaesthesia is primarily a function of inherent cognitive capacities for abstraction and representation in the human brain.
