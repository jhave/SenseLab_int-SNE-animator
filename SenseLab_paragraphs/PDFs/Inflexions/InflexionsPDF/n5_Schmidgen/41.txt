In  this  connection, Simondon criticizes  the  direction of technological progress. The case  of the  telephone is here  perhaps the  most  striking. Again,  the  images speak   for  themselves.  As  they   make   clear,   the  exterior  forms   of  telephonic devices  have  been  condensed between the 1920s and  1950s. The receiver  and  the cradle  came closer to the body  of the dial apparatus, which,  in turn,  was reduced in its size.  However, a look  at the  interior of two  exemplary devices  from  1928 and  1951 quickly  demonstrates that  only  minor  improvements took  place.  The apparent  concretization reveals   itself  as  a  mere   adaptation  of  the  casing   to practical use.  Simondon comments this  as if it were  a kind  of ideological trick “The  course   of  minor   improvements is  one  of  detours;  useful   as  they  are  in certain  cases  of practical use,  they  hardly lead  to the  evolution of the  technical object” (Simondon 1989: 37).
