In  his  photographs, Simondon shows  technical objects  of different kinds,  size, and  age.  He  focuses  on  two  prime examples, the  combustion engine   and  the vacuum tube.  With  respect to  the  former, he  draws on  motorcycles from  the simple  VÃ©losolex  to racers  such as the Norton Manx and  the Sunbeam S7 as well as automobiles of the 1930s, 1940s and  early  1950s (Simca 6, Renault Juvaquatre, Peugeot 203). In the  case of the  vacuum tube  he shows  triodes (6Q7G, 6J6, ECC
83, etc.) and  pentodes (B 443, E446, EF 50, etc.) from the period between 1920 and
1950.  The  third  example is  the  telephone.  Here,   Simondon  focuses   on  two anonymous devices  dating from 1928 and 1950.
