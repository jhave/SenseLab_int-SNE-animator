This  bivalency  is  not  simply  resulting  from  a  compromise.  Rather   it  is  the outcome of a dynamic convergence or “concomitance”. Differently put,  it refers back  to one  of the  dynamic processes that  characterize the  concretization of the technical  object.   Simondon  defines  concretization  as   the   “convergence  of functions into a structural unit”  (1989: 22). More generally he states,  “The essence of concretization of a technical object is the organizing of functional sub-systems into the total functioning” (1989: 31). This, then,  does not mean  a Vers le concret in the sense of Jean Wahl, i.e. not a movement in which  the Ideational, Cognitive or Philosophical would come increasingly closer to the “material opacity” of reality
– for example, from  the  idea  of some  engineer to the  successful realization of a technology (or the non-successful ‘realization’, as in Latour’s Aramis) ( Wahl 1932:
14; Latour 1996).
