touched upon their  genesis.  However, how  should a series  of images  be able to depict this  genesis  without being  confronted with  the  double difficulty of (a) pushing  the   origin   farther  and   farther  back,   since  the   discovery  of  earlier versions or models always remains possible, and  (b) jumping immediately to the “simplest form”  that,  as shown in the Pitt-Rivers’s example, remains a postulate with  little significance?
