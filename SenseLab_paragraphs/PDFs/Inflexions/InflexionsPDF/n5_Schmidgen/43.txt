value   of  technical  objects  with   “social  myths” (mythes  sociaux) and   “opinion trends” (mouvements d’opinion). As a result,  his perspective on the technical object seems  to be less  an  internalist than  a normative one.  It consists  in emphasizing and,  if necessary, defending the value  of technology with  respect, and  in contrast to,  other   values   (economical,  sociological,  psychological,  etc.).  As  with   the telephone,  his   corresponding  conclusion  with   respect  to   the   car   is  rather pessimistic. “The automobile, this technical object that is so charged with  psychic and  social implications, is not suitable for technical progress: whatever advances there   are  in  the  automobile come  from  neighboring  areas,   such  as  aviation, shipping, and  transport trucks” (Simondon 1989: 21). In  fact,  the  photography that is devoted to the development of the piston rod clearly shows  how the shape of this rod in the Peugeot 203 was modeled after the same rod in a Ford transport truck.  In other  words, this  component of a technical object did  also not develop continuously but was suddenly imported from one of the regions in which  – just as  in  the  matériel de guerre – technical  aspects  are  still  more   important  than economical ones.
