In the projection room  of this cinema  of technology we encounter one of the basic insights  of   material  culture  studies.  Some   years   after   the   publication  of Simondon’s   book,   the   art   historian  George   Kubler   has   presented,  in   his remarkable book  The Shape of Time, a similarly sequential notion of the  object “The  oldest  surviving things made  by man  are  stone  tools.  A continuous series runs  from  them  to  the  things of  today […] Everything made  now  is either  a replica  or a variant of something made  a little time  ago and  so on back without break  to the  first  morning of human time”  (Kubler  1962: 2).   Kubler,  a former student of Henri  Focillon,  assumes that  the  sequence of things has  never  been interrupted. One could  say that  it is the closeness to precisely this sequence that allows  Simondon to  relate  the  technical object  back  to  its  earlier  versions and models. However,  Simondon does  not  confront the  object  with  the  writings, drawings and  calculations that  accompany and/or follow  its production. Hence, the task that the cinematographer of technology faces at this point  consists  of presenting the  technical object as an authentic motion picture. Simondon has  to set the film of structures and  function into movement, from  the back to the front that  is, since he is going  from the present to the past.  The first example for this is the combustion engine.
