This becomes  quite  obvious in a remarkable passage where Simondon addresses domesticated  plants  as  artificial   objects.   The  breeding  process  breaks   up   a hitherto coherent system of biological functions, in order to focus on a distinctive property, such as blossoming. During this process, the plant  becomes  dependent on a new and  much  more  specific environment, i.e. the greenhouse. As if he were anticipating   current   discussions   concerning   biotechnology,   [2]   Simondon explains that  the  corresponding breeding product is comparable to an  abstract technical  object.  In  abstract technolog y,  the  functions  are  organized  in  poor coherence  and   therefore  remain  dependent  on   specific   surroundings,  “for example a laboratory, or a workshop or, in certain  cases,  a factory” (Simondon
1989: 47).
