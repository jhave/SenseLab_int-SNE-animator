As an organizing as well as integrating tendency, concretization situates itself in the concrete, in the contracting materiality of the technical object. It seems  by no means  accidental then  that  the  concept acquires here  a meaning which  can  be found in one  of the  philosophers that  Wahl  presents and  discusses in his book, namely Alfred  North Whitehead. Similar  to Whitehead, Simondon conceives of concretization as a concrescence, i.e. a “process of passage” bringing actual  entities “into conjunctive unity” (Whitehead 1960: 32).
