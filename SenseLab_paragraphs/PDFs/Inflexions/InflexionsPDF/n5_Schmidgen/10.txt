After disassembling his technical objects and  decomposing them  down to piston rods,   control   grids,   and  resistors,  Simondon  starts   their  photographic reassembling. First,  he  shows  the  development of the  combustion engine  on  a total of seven  b/w-photographs. Five of them  depict single motors against a dark background, while  white  writing on the  photograph identifies parts  such  as the cylinder, the explosion chamber, the spark plug  and  cooling  fins. The two  other photographs show  corresponding clippings of motorcycle images.  The resulting series is segmented and  distributed onto two pages.  The aforementioned is complemented by two  additional photographs in which,  Simondon presents the “evolution of the piston” and  the “evolution of the piston rod”  – i.e. two interior parts  of the combustion engine  – in an overview that  puts  four  respective forms into chronological order.
