Huxley’s Evidence as to Man’s Place in Nature (1863) that  staged a row  of gradually erected skeletons leading from  the Gibbon and  the chimpanzee to homo  sapiens. At the same time, it connects itself with  the origins    of   the    anthropology   and    ethnography   of   technology   and    the corresponding  collection   and   exhibition  projects.   In   particular,  it  was   the
