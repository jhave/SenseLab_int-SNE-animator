[1] In what  follows  I am quoting from  the  partial English  translation by Ninian Mellamphy, published as typescript under the  title  On  the Mode of Existence of Technical Objects, with  a Preface  by  John  Hart,  University of  Western Ontario,
1980. References are given  in brackets with  no further reference. In some  cases, I have   modified  quotes  from   the   English   translation.  Where   terminological precision and  further clarification was required, I co-quote the French  original.
