the  volumetric unit  (the  cylinder or  cylinder-head) from  the  heat dissipation unit.  If one were  to grind and  saw  off the cylinder gills in  an  air  cooled   engine,   the  volumetric  unit   constituted by  the cylinder alone  would no  longer  be viable,  not  even  as volumetric unit;  it would buckle  under gaseous pressure. The volumetric and mechanical unit  has  become  co-extensive with  the  heat  dispersal unit because the structure of the whole  is bi-valent (Simondon 1989:
15).
