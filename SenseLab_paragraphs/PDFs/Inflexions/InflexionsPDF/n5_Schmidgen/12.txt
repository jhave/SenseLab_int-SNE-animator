Fig. 1 Photograph by Simondon showing the evolution of the electronic tube  from  1924 to 1952 as a concretization process. His  commentary (top  left)  reads: “The  ebonite socket reduces itself  and disappears.  In  contrast,  the   active   parts  evolve and  occupy the   entire  volume  of  the   glass ampoule” (Simondon 1989).
