The  same  year  that  Simondon’s  book  was  published, Alain  Resnais  finished a commercial  documentary,  titled   Le  chant  du  styrène.  In  this   movie,   Resnais follows   the   way   of  styrene  through  its   production   process.  Showing  the transitions of  this  chemical   substance, he  comes  from  its  fluid  state  and   the granulation to its fixation  in plastic  goblets  and  bowls,  while  in the background Raymond Queneau reads  his  commentary-poem “[...] ô matière plastique / D’où viens-tu?  [...]  Remontons  de l’objet/  À  ses aïeux lointains!”  (Queneau n.d.).  In  a similar  way,  Simondon retraces, by means  of his image  series, the changing form of technical objects. However, this retracing is not happening with  respect to the production process (as in  Resnais)  but,  as it were,  with  regard to  the  process- product: as a scaling  down of the exterior and  a condensation of the interior, as a moving together of  components, as  with  their  differentiation. In  a  procedure similar  to time-lapse cinematography, Simondon’s series – his juxtaposed photographs of single  objects  as well  as his photographs of juxtaposed things – temporalize  the   technical  object.   They   reconstruct  the   past   of  the   object. Simondon has  no  interest in a history of technology that  would emphasize the role  of  inventors and  engineers, institutions and  interests. Rather,  his cinematographic method aims  at a history of things that  focuses  on the  “internal necessity” (Simondon 1989: 17) of  the  technical object  and  its  “adaptation to itself” (1989: 13).
