internal necessities of the technical object seem  to go very  far, for example when he  no  longer   refers  the  standardization of  exchangeable machine parts   to  the social and  economic history of the factory  system but to the developmental status of the objects themselves. “It is not the production-line which  produces standardization;  rather it  is  intrinsic standardization  [of  the  technical  object] which  makes  the  production-line possible” (Simondon 1989: 17). However, the social  actors  and   forces  are  not  missing in  the  first  section   of  his  book.  For example,  Simondon  discusses  the  relation  of  economic  and   technical requirements (the  reduction of the  required amount of raw  material converges with  the concretization of the technical object). He points out that  the automobile is situated in a polarized field  defined by the individual wishes  of the customer on the one side  and  commercial strategies of producers and  sellers  on the other. In addition, in his discussion of the  electronic tube  he names the  scientists and engineers involved, from  Tellegen  and de Forest back to Fleming  and  others.
