With these  explanations, it becomes  plausible why  Simondon, in the first part  of his   book,   places   much   emphasis  on   the   seriality  of  technical  objects   and somewhat backgrounds their  discontinuity. This focus can be seen as reflecting a cultural situation in which  the  act of inventing is far less wide  spread than  the use  of new  and  old  technical objects.  But above  all the  primacy of the  series  is based  on  methodological decisions that  translate the  fact  that  the  sequence of things, the movie  of matter has always already begun before  we, as constructors or consumers, have  the impression we are watching it from  the  very  beginning. By means  of his serial  photographs Simondon pictures the  times  of technolog y. In that sense, he can be called a cinematographer of machines.
