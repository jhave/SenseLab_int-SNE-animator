Eventually it is the  text  that  responds to this  problem. It answers the  question concerning “the absolute origins  of a technical lineage” (Simondon 1989: 40) with the  argument that  a “definite act of invention” (Simondon 1989: 41) constitutes the authentic basis for generating new  technical objects. This argument is supplemented by  the  thesis  that  “inventions” of new  technical objects  do  not simply rely  on ideas  and  inspirations and  do not  depend on collective  interests and  imaginations. Rather,  Simondon embeds the  act  of invention as  deeply as possible into  the  sequence of things that  surfaced in  his  detailed engagement with  the  evolving materiality of the  technical object.  In Simondon’s  view  then, the creation of new  technical objects is necessarily linked to the presence and  the use  of  already existing   technical objects,  a  use  within which  these  things are produced, varied and  selected, until  an  oriented mutation brings  about  a new bifurcation and  a new  object that,  in turn,  can be again  reproduced, varied and selected. In  a  similar   context,   Kubler   speaks   about   the  emergence of  “prime objects”  which  he also calls “mutants”, or simply of “things of great  generative power” (1962:  41)  that   become   the  material  model  for  a  new   succession  of replicas  and   variants.  Similar   to  Queneau  (Remontons  de  l’objet/  À  ses  aïeux lointains!), Simondon prefers to speak  about  the “forefathers” or “ancestors” (ancêtres) of a family  of things through which  and  in which  the  technical object develops. In the petrol  engine  for example, this ancestor-thing is the gas engine. Despite the  fact that  this  engine  displays some  analogies to the  steam  engine  – for example by the arrangement of the cylinder, the piston and  the transmission system – it breaks  with  this  structure because it embodies a schematic feature that  did  not  exist  before  “In  the  steam  engine,  both  the  boiler,  producing gas under pressure, and  the  heat  source  were  outside of  the  cylinder. In  the  gas
