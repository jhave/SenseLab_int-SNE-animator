The  image   section   does   try  to  respond  to  this  problem,  for  example when separating isolated sequences from  the total  series  of the electronic tube  and presenting them  separatel y. However, this only  shifts  the problem, and  it seems a  completely different  kind   of  picture would  be  required in  order to  show authentic discontinuities, for example a Darwinian bifurcation diagram such  as the knife chart by Friedrich Kiesler (fig. 4).
