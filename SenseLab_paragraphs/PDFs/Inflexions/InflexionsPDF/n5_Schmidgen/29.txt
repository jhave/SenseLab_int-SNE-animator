The   cylinder-head  of   the   thermal  internal  combustion  engine bristles  with  cooling  gills  specially developed in the  valve  region which  are subject  to intense changes in heat  and  high  pressures. In early engines, the cooling  gills are as it were  extraneously added on to cylinder and  cylinder-head which,  in theor y, are  geometrically cylindrical: they  fulfill  a  single  function only,  that  of  cooling.  In recent  engines, these  gills have  an added function of a mechanical kind,  that  of preventing the  buckling of the  cylinder-head under gaseous thrust. In these  conditions, it is impossible to distinguish
