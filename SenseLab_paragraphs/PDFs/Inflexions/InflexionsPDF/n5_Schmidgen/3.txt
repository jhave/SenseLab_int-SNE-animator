The first section  of Simondon’s book on the mode  of existence  of technical objects is devoted to studying the genesis  and  evolution of these  objects. In this section, the images  are of decisive  importance (Simondon 1989). [1] At first sight,  the photographs that  Simondon presents in the appendix to his book merely seem to illustrate the  fact that  technical objects  have  indeed a material gestalt. In other words, their  mode  of existence  cannot be reduced to that  of a “pure scheme  of function” (schème pur de fonctionnement) or a mathematical formula. In contrast to abstract depictions of machines, as they  are  known in the  engineering sciences, these  photos indeed display concrete visual  forms.  Insofar  as they  are indexical signs,   one  could   even   say  that   they   confront  us  with   bodily   traces   of  the technical. However, that  is not  all. Simondon’s images  serve  a far more  general purpose. By means  of juxtaposition and  chronological arrangement, the photographs make  comprehensible that  and  how  the material gestalt of technical objects changes over time. They do not illustrate a process that  is already known and  understood. Rather  they  establish this process in a quasi-inductive manner. In other  words, these images  picture Simondon’s argument before it is written.
