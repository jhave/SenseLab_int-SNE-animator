The decisive  point  here  is that  this history is never  accomplished or achieved. In other  words, history does  not  function as  the  simple  pre-history to  some  final form.  Rather,  the  past  of the  object is, in a certain  sense,  its presence. Simondon insists  on this point  “the genesis  of the technical object is part  of its being,”  (1989:
12) and  “the  past  evolution of a technical being  remains as an  essential of this being  in  its  technical form.”  (1989: 12, n.  1) In  a sense,  then,  the  image  series transforms the  technical object  into  a movie-like being.  For  Simondon such  an object  ‘is’  precisely the  series  or  sequence of  earlier   technical things that  are evoked  by  the  respective present  thing   –  not  by  way   of  more   or  less  free associations, but according to the genetic  method, i.e. with  respect to the internal changes of its structures and  functions. As a consequence, what  is called  ‘object’ appears to be a kind  of film or strip  of matter. However, this  strip  is often  only accessible  by means  of stills from the end of the movie.
