Neutrality with   respect to  the  guiding  opposition of  ‘nature/culture’  is  also claimed when Simondon insists  on the asymptotic character of concretization in technical  objects.  As  he  explains, these  objects  “tend towards concretization, whereas natural objects, as living  beings,  are concrete right  from  the beginning” (Simondon 1989: 50). It becomes  obvious here  that  drawing genetic  analogies between technical objects  and  living  beings  does  not  result  in  identifying one with  the  other.  To the  contrar y, Simondon’s  genetic  method guarantees at this point  that  his  study of the  technical object  is not  resolving itself  into  a kind  of general biology.  Concretized technical objects  are  not  natural objects.  However, they  can be compared with  living  beings  in instructive ways,  e.g. with  respect to their  inner  coherence, their  relation to the environment and  the required or non- required interventions of  human beings.   Conversel y,  drawing such  analogies underscores that  technical objects necessarily require a specific empirical science, a  “general technology or  mechanology” (Simondon 1989: 48) taking   seriously their  status as  concretized objects,  i.e. as  objects  that  do  not  correspond to  an
