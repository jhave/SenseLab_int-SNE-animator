However, Simondon is neither an  anthropologist of technology (Ã  la limite he could  be  called  an  ethnographer of modernity), nor  a museologist, curator or draftsperson. His  images  of technical objects  are  technical images.  Insofar  they open    yet   another   perspective.  They   make    clear   that   the   philosopher  of technology acts,  in the  first  section  of his  book,  as a kind  of cinematographer. Despite the fact that  Simondon uses the photograph and  not the film camera, his obvious goal consists  in picturing the time of machine beings.
