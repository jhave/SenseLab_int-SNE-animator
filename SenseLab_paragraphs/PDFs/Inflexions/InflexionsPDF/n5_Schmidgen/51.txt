Simondon makes  a similar  argument with  respect to the  vacuum tube.  In this case,  it is obviously the  diode that  functions as ‘ancestor’  of the  triode and  the pentode. Conversel y, the diode is related to the gas discharge tube  developed by Crooke  and  Coolidge. However, the electrodes in these tubes  were  not polarized, so  the  conductance remained symmetrical. Only  the  discovery of  the thermoelectric effect  allowed for  the  possibility of building an  analog  tube  in which   a  functional asymmetry  between electrodes could   be  installed, i.e.  the diode. This  is  how  the  beginning of  a  new  technical  object  was  defined. Its functional scheme  remains active in the triode and  the pentode.
