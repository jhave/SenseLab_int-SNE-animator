Simondon’s  text  accentuates the  distinction characterized by  means  of the  two stills.  On  the  one  hand, he  calls  the  technical  object  an  object  of  “analytical order”, while  the concrete is “synthetic” (Simondon 1989: 18). On the other  hand, he  compares the  initial  (abstract) form  of the  technical object  with  a regime of “manufacture”, whereas he  compares its  advanced  (concretized) form  to  the “industry”.  Eventually, the  abstract object  appears as  the  result   of  applying combined resources of practical knowledge. In contrast, the concrete technical object   cannot  be   understood   simply  through  the   application  of   existing knowledge. Even scientific insight does “not make  possible an absolute and rigorously precise  forecast  of all effects” that emerge within the object (Simondon
1989: 32). In other  words “The technical object is never  completely known” (Simondon 1989: 32).
