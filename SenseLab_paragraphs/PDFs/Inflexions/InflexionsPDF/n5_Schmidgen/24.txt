In the  modern engine,  each  critical  piece  is so connected with  the rest by reciprocal exchanges of energy that it cannot be other  than  it is. The shape of the  cylinder, the  shape and  size of the  valves  and the shape of the piston are all part  of the same  system [â€¦] in which a multitude of reciprocal causalities exist. To the shape of these elements  there    corresponds  a   compression  ratio   which    itself requires a determined degree of spark advance;  the  shape of the cylinder-head,  and   the  metal   of  which   it  is  made,   produce,  in relation to all the other  elements of the cycle, a certain  temperature in the spark plug  electrodes; this temperature in turn  affects the characteristics  of  the  ignition  and,   as  a  result,   the  whole   cycle (Simondon 1989: 13-14).
