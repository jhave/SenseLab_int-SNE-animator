investigation  of  the  changing  interior  of  the  technical  object  is  based   on  a similarly polemic vision  of development. In his perspective, the  technical object appears as a “theater of a number of relationships of reciprocal causality” (Simondon 1989: 22), i.e. a scene  of structural and  functional conflicts  that  are solved  gradually or  suddenly. The  goal  of this  process is a state  in  which  the object  is “no  longer  divided against itself”  (Simondon 1989: 30) or,  to be more precise,  “no  longer  fighting with  itself  (n’est plus en lutte avec lui-même)” (1989:
34).  One  could  say,  then,  that  Roux’s developmental mechanics of the  embryo renews itself here as a developmental mechanology of the technical object.
