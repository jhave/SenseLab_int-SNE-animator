Similarly  structured are his photographs of vacuum tubes.  The image  concerning the “evolution of the vacuum tube from 1924 to 1952” shows  ten successive types of tubes:  from  the  clunky and  bellied  shapes of the  twenties and  thirties to the small  and  slim  models of the  fifties (fig. 1). As with  the  combustion engine,  an additional series of images  – a total of nine photographs – depict the evolution of separate components of the technical object: the socket, the electrodes, the control grid,  etc. With  respect to the  telephone, Simondon eventually juxtaposes the  six photographs of the two devices  that  he has dissected and  investigated. They are shown from  the top  and  the bottom as well  as inside  and  outside, with  separate photos for the receiver.
