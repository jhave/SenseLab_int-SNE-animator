The reason for this rather direct  engagement with  things is simple.  According to Simondon it is not sufficient to define  a technical object by means  of its belonging to  a  specific  ‘kind’  or  ‘genre’  because the  corresponding  categories are  often defined with  respect to the  use  or  purpose of the  object in question. Headings such   as  “power  machine”  unite   quite   heterogeneous  things,  e.g.  the  steam engine,  the  combustion engine,  the  water motor,  and  the  clockwork driven by springs or weights. Simondon’s objection  is “there is a more  apt analogy between a spring-engine and  a bow  or  crossbow than  between the  former and  a steam engine” (1989: 11).
