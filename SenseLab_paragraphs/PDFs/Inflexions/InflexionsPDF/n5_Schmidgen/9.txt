appropriate ways.  That is the reason why  Simondon applies a “genetic method” (1989:  12,  n.  1)  that   operates  on  the   basis   of  comparisons  and   focuses   on structural  analogies.    This   method  investigates  the   ontogenesis  of  various technical objects,  and  at  the  same  time  takes  into  account the  genesis  of other kinds  of objects,  for  example aesthetic objects,  and  above  all living  beings,  i.e. natural objects.
