model of thinking processes - notably cognitivism and constructivism - but in many ways, the influence of Pavlov’s dogs has been so great that these alternatives find it difficult to escape the shadow of the dogs - their harnessing, their testing, their conditioning, their reduction to more abstract diagrams and models, their experimental neurosis. Under the powerful magic of a model such as Pavlov’s diagrammed dogs, alternatives can run the risk of multiplying the impact of cognitive-behavioural models (which are now often found together, as in CBT) on cultural practice. I also think it is Pavlov’s dogs that very effectively demonstrate how models arise from embodied experience.
