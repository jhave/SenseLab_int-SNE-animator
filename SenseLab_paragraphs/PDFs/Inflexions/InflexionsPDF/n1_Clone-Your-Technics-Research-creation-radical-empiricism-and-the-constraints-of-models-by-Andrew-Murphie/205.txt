predominant model of communication - the Shannon-Weaver model. This is a model that famously attempts to reduce noise in favour of clear, one-way linear transmission of signal through a docile channel. This is, of course, very sensible when trying to get a message through to a gunner - in the very noisy situation of battle - to shoot down an incoming plane. Yet, thankfully, this is not the situation we find ourselves in most of the time.
