One of the first counter-intuitive ideas in Deleuze’s Difference and Repetition is that repetition in itself inevitably opens to difference. This is because it is in repetition that we contract  events  into  a  sensed  duration.  It  is  this  which  enabled  us  to  feel  differential movement (in the martial arts or dance, for example, two repetitions of established sequences of movement feel simultaneously related and always different). This contraction - as habit - is fundamentally enabling. In Deleuze’s view, habit is never a matter of ‘just repeating’ things as they were. It is rather a matter of creating the smallest durations between one instance and another  in  order  both  to  repeat  and  to  differ.  Habit  -  even  within  one’s  own  isolated experience - is therefore always relational. We are not just our relations with others. We are quite literally made up of relations to ourselves - shifting differential durations - through time. Even if we can clone our technics - our modes of repetition - we can never clone our selves.
