For all these reasons, creation is often folded into institutionalised research in a particular manner, the more so as creativity becomes an industry. Martin Heidegger’s description of research  as  ‘ongoing  activity’  (1996:53)  remains  apposite.  For  Heidegger,  the  ongoing activity of research attempts to confirm a certain ‘world picture’ - aligned with certain disciplines and faculties. More importantly, the very idea of affirming a complete and stable world as picture - as being able to be represented - becomes the central aim of research. It is important to note again that even here such research is not uncreative or even closed in any absolute sense. Heidegger’s term ‘ongoing activity’ reflects this.
