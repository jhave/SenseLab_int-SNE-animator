Despite this sensitivity - such as it is - I want to point out the obvious. The sign of Pavlovâ€™s dog, and the models associated with it, have had an enormous effect on cultural practice (not least within educational and other performance cultures, although I am certainly not suggesting that all of this has been negative). Constraint in research-creation is a double- edged sword.
