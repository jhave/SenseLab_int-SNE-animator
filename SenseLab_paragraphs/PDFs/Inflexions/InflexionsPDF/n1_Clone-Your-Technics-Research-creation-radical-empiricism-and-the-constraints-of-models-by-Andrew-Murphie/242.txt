it with propositions, is actualized’ (Deleuze and Guattari, 1994: 118). Alliez takes this further, suggesting that functions - even functions that, somewhat like signs, envelop matter in a metric schema (Alliez: 49) - might slow down matter without abandoning that which ‘draws [this  schema]  outside  itself’.  Thinking  this  way  allows  for  a  ‘definition  in  tension  of  the modern power of science, which sees integrated into its functional practice the force-field
that constitutes it’ (Alliez: 49).
