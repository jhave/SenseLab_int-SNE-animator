Some caveats or principles about where to start when working with embodiment. First, it's not a good idea to insist that mind should be embodied, or that it should be taken as extended throughout an ecology (that is, mind is ‘brain, body and world’, as Andy Clark puts it). Mind already is both. Second, not only do we ‘not know what a body can do’ - as Baruch Spinoza points out - in theory – and we do not know what we might be able to do with body one day. We don't know what our bodies will do, in practice, from moment to moment (thus another important aspect of questioning habit and the micro-constitution of experience -keeping up with embodiment). We keep only a rough control - sometimes like a sailing ship in a breeze, but sometimes also like the same ship in a perfect storm.
