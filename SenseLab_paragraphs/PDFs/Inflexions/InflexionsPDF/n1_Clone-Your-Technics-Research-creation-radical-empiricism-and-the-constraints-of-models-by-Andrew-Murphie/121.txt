The technical complexity of much of this is relatively recent. However, it draws on the frantic vestiges of 1950s cognitivism, in which every proper thought had to be processed neatly and cleanly, within a defined and knowable technical system that would tidy up the performance not only of communication, but of thought itself. As new forms of reaction-creation seem to overwhelm older institutions - as new technics begin to be cloned - the way we think differently about the processes of thinking will be crucial.
