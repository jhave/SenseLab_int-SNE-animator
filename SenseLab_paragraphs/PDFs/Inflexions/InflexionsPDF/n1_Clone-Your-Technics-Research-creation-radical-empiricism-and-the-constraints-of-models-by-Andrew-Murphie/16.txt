Research-creation  does  not  mimic  biblical  creation.  It  is  not  so  much  an  engagement between us on the one hand and the world on the other. It is more a matter of what Massumi calls ‘worlding’. Here “the self-network is a worlding of the human” (Massumi 2002: 128). There is an ongoing mix of relations between habits, perceptions and the movement of our specific ecological contexts. To create the new is to participate in worlding differently.
