Worlding with awareness is made possible by the refusal - a technically orchestrated refusal - of the world to be owned, by legal deed, by concept, or by experimental design. To research is to focus, then, on how participation occurs. This is again a question of technics. Technics describes the partial, always incomplete attempt at what used to be thought of as agency (now
agency as participation and becoming) within worlding.
