One can only understand the aspects of thought we call faculties - or in fact any elements by which we think we know, and therefore arrange, thought, from the point of view of their destruction by their objects. Moreover, here “one cannot prejudge the outcome of research’” (Deleuze, 1994: 143). Some well-known faculties may “turn out to have no proper limit” (and can therefore never be understood, thus Jacques Derrida’s ‘différance’ without limit). There may be “new faculties ... which were repressed by … common sense” (Deleuze, 1994: 144). This is before we get to the destruction of any image of thought, as per Deleuze’s Artaud.
