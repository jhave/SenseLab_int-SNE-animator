‘How do you do it?’ has a simple practical answer. Tell people what works - technically. Clone your technics. Make copies. Distribute them. Make them available to others on the web (make an interpersonal equivalent of BitTorrent for research-creation technics, learn from the Open Source community). It’s like giving cuttings of plants to others for their garden. It’s actually hard to begin to understand research of any kind until you’ve done it - especially its precise technical limitations and possibilities. Moreover, although we are not the first to experiment - there have always been radical empiricists, and a radically empiricist mode of living - we are only now perhaps developing and popularising the vocabulary, the concepts,  the  technics.  It’s  often  hard  to  explain  exactly  the  vocabulary,  the  concepts.
However, technics are something that can be easily communicated, experienced.
