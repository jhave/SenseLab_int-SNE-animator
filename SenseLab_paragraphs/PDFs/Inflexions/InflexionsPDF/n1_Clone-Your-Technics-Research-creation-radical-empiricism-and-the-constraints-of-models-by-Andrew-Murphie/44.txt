I will write more about dogs and empiricism below, but for now I’ll note that some of the workshops I’ve been to that worked best in terms of opening out to a radical empiricism were those in which animals (usually dogs, but also sometimes cats, or even kangaroos or kookaburras in Australia, the latter of which have a laugh which is an instant call to radical empiricism) wandered through, and often children as well. All these carry their own leaky radical empiricisms - their percepts, their affects, their creation of concepts.
