David E. Johnson has pointed to the significance of the dog at a crucial moment in Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason - perhaps the crucial moment not only of this book, but of whatever it was that was to become the modern and the West. Johnson doubts that Kant took a dog along for his famous walks. Yet the dog - as concept - nevertheless accompanies him ‘at the moment in the Critique of Pure Reason that he determines the possibility of the conceptualization of sense perception’ (Johnson: 19). Here time - and therefore contingency, shifting ecologies of relations, perhaps relations themselves - are subjugated to the search for the structure of the
faculties - the modeling and regulation of cognition.7
