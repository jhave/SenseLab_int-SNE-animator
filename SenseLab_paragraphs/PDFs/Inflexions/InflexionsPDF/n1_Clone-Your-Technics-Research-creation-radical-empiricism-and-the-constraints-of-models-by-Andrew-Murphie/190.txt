[...] breakdown in the dogâ€™s behaviour became known - perhaps misleadingly - as an experimental neurosis [...] In one [experiment], a dog had been conditioned with great difficulty to salivate when an electric shock to one of its rear feet was the conditioned stimulus. Originally, the dog had responded to the shock by struggling in its harness and trying to escape the situation. After many reinforcements with food, however, it began to accept the shock calmly, and immediately began salivating when it was administered. On the crucial trial, the shock was applied to a different leg from that to which it had become accustomed. The stimulus elicited a much stronger avoidance response than the animal had ever shown before [...] All of the earlier conditioning disappeared, and the animal required several months to recover from its neurosis.
