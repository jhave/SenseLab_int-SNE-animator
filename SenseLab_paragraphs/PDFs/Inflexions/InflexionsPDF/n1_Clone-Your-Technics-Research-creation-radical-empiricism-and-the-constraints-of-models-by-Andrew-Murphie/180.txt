The  second  of  these  cultural  practices  related  to  experiment  is  one  that  to  some  extent inverts the first, or sometimes, if this is possible, simply ignores it. This is radical empiricism
- in which the reality of contingent experience, of relations, of multiplicities, of encounters, is not corralled but taken into account. Experiment here has a very different meaning in that it is relations, contingent experience, that lead out of models.
