It is not states of affairs that are the problem. It is the imposition of fixed arrangements - certain technics - by which thought is considered to be thought. Thought is the opposite to a fixed process or form of self-fulfilling recognition. The process or aim - such as there is one - is creation. For Deleuze, ‘To think is to create - there is no other creation - but to create is first of all to engender thinking within thought’ (1994: 147). In the process, given arrangements of thought are destroyed.
