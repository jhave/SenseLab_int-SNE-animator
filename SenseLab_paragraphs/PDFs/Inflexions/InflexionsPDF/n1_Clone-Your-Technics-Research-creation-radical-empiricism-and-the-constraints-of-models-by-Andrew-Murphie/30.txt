impossibilities of closure (art). Just as importantly, we are all increasingly immersed in the bigger pictures of science and art as these two dramatically reconfigure their relations, often with us as their laboratory. Better known examples might be the dramatic increase in the use of pharmaceutical products targeting the brain, basic self-improvement or performance management, or the regulation of teaching and learning via technics of preterritorialisation (defining learning outcomes and aligning these with assessment, learning activities, and constrained forms of student feedback, all of these in turn feeding into performance management).  These  situations  -  in  which  it  becomes  harder  to  picture  a  stable  world  - suggest that we are truly situated in a worlding of shifting self-network relations (not always of the most ethical sort), more than a world picture. This is not only by virtue of what is almost a command to take up ongoing activity, as both scientists and artists. We are also immersed as subjects in a series of ongoing experiments (whether by the World Bank or global warming) that the Futurists themselves could not have dreamed of.   So the stakes
involved in thinking through research-creation are very high.
