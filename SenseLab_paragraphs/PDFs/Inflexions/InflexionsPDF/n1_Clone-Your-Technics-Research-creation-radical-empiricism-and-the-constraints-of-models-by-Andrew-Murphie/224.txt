In short, one’s thinking processes  - or more accurately the need for a model of thinking processes - become the basis for experience, not the other way around. To put this slightly differently, one understands one’s own thinking on the basis of one’s models of thinking processes. Relations, contingency, time are subjugated to these models. In the process, there seem to be a lot of dead dogs. It is perhaps interesting in passing to note, there are also dead ducks, as much later, Norbert Wiener, the founder of cybernetics, saw the whole problem of
cybernetic systems as arising from his experience as a duck hunter.8
