George Lakoff and Mark Johnsonâ€™s theory of metaphor is useful here. For them metaphor is always an abstraction - if initially a slight abstraction - that can only be meaningful because we relate it to embodied experience that we ourselves have had. In short, metaphors in everyday life are an example of how a kind of low-level radical empiricism is turned into model. Simple examples are those of feeling up or feeling down.
