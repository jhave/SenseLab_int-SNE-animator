1 One could see a new domain of contemporary politics opening up here at the level of the emergence of events, one for political research-creation. This is at once the domain in which there is a struggle between preterritorialisation, what Erin Manning has labeled
‘preacceleration’ (2007), the feeling that comes just before an event of movement, and what Bernard Stiegler has called the ‘pseudo a priori’ (2003), a technics that regulates what comes before by reconfiguring it afterwards, as if such things had always been this way (as Stiegler points out, for example, ‘the a priori of synthetic judgment of consciousness takes place after the event’).
