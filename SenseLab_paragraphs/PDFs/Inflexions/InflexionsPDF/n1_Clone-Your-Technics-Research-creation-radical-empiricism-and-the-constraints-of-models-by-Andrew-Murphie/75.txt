We need to think about cloning our technics then, in terms of the way that this cloning fosters an awareness/experience of difference within research creation. First, this is not only a question of a morphogenetic variation but a variation over time within the relations that hold any form together. Second, with this more complex understanding of our habits as a kind of basic series of techniques for holding our own difference and repetition together, and our technics as a kind of ecological form of difference and repetition, we can see technics in research creation as a way of habitualising our existential ecologies differently, of finding the micro-forms of living that can tolerate/work with impossible closure, impossible openness.
