structure immanent to any given interaction, which exceeds it, but inheres within it, and makes it possible. As Deleuze puts it, ‘The reality of the virtual is structure. We must avoid giving the elements and relations which form a structure an actuality that they do not have, and withdrawing from them a reality which they have’ (1994:209). Think of a delightful picnic, or a nightmare. Think of the elements and relations which exceed this picnic or nightmare, but from which picnics or nightmares come into being, or more correctly, actualise as durational experience over time.
