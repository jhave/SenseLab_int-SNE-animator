Technically then, the question is not one of whether we should have research-creation or not, but of what kind of research-creation we are able to have. There can be little doubt that much research  is  pushed  -  particularly  by  institutions  which  are  constantly  reconstituted  by  a certain mode of technics of discipline or control - towards what I am calling here preterritorialisation. This is the attempt to standardise and recuperate research into a certain order  before  it  occurs,  even  if  in  terms  of  a  standard  deviation  or  pre-fixed  range  of variations or possible modulations. This attempt at order is doomed in absolute terms (after all, change changes), although technics is all about the extent to which such a doom can be postponed.
