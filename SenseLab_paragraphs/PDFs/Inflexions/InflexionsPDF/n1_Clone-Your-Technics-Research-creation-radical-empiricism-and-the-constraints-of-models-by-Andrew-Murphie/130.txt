To radical empiricism. This is a “philosophy of pure experience” (James, 86), and experience here is of the continuous transition of movement-matter. More than this, it is the relation of one transition of movement-matter - involving brain, body and world - to other transitions. This interwoven series of transitions produces shifting intensities which in turn (recursively) produce transitions. Thus experience is both of and via the ongoing (intensive) differential relations which for all these philosophies make up the world. Put simply, “experience itself, taken at large, can grow by its edges” and “life is in the transitions’”(James, 87).
