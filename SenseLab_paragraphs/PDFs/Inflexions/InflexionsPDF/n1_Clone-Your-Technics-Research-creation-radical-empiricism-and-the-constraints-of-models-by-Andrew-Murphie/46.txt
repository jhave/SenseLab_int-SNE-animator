It is of course said that one should ‘Never work with children and animals’.  Why? They’re unpredictable. They don’t follow the script. Put a dog or a child on stage and they will explore it for what it is, not what it represents - or perhaps freeze, not having been habituated to performing their part but aware that something is demanded – a script must be followed. For the radical empiricist, however, it’s the script that, while often enabling, needs to be departed from. This is in fact a purer empiricism as nothing, not even habit, sticks to the script, even in the most rigorous repetition.
