Let’s return to Pavlov’s dogs. As with Shannon and Weaver, a particular embodied context, namely a dog freely moving around, is not only reduced in its field of action (harnessed in a lab).5 It is then abstracted, reduced to this abstract. If you look for pictures of Pavlov’s dog on the web, one of the first things you’ll find is that there are few actual pictures, but many diagrams of the dog constrained within a little apparatus - so that its saliva can be collected and the bell rung (and shocks given, etc). The dog is reduced to a cartoon of salivation (there are  literally  lots  of  joke  cartoons  out  there  concerning  conditioned  reflexes).6    These diagrams, in turn, form the basis for an even more abstract model, namely of the conditioned reflex (or even behaviourism). This all begins quite literally - in direct experienced relations, excluded from the diagrams and models  - with the constraining of the real dog into an apparatus.
