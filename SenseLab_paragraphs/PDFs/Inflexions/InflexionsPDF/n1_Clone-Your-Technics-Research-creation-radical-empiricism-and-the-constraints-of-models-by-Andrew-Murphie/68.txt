Standardization does not guard against change because, famously, as described in Deleuze’s Difference and Repetition, repetition and difference are mutually involved. For Deleuze, difference is not a difference between objects, but a difference over the time of the repetition, in duration, the new intensity of flows that shipping containers make possible, for example (the difference container shipping keeps making to the world). Such forms of differential repetition supplement the human in order to express the human in interaction with other forms of supplementation, of rocks, of animals, of climate (think here of the shipping of King Kong from a remote island to New York perhaps). In supplementing the human, the technics of   differential   repetition   also   define   the   human,   and   thus   Deleuze   and   Guattari’s
‘mechanosphere’ (1987: 514) or Bernard Stiegler’s understanding of technics (1998).
