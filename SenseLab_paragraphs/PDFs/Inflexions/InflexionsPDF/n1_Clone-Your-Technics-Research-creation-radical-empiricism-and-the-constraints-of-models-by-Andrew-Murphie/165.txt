As  I  have  suggested,  a  crucial  series  of  models  is  that  involving  thinking  processes themselves. Indeed, perhaps most basic models for Western culture are those of thinking processes. It is via these models that thinking becomes cognition - and not only in theory. Such models perform a kind of ‘brain-magic’ (Murphie,  2006) - a transformation of forces and  relations.4   Via  the  magic  diagrams  of  models,  thinking  really  does  tend  towards becoming cognition, technically speaking, which is to say, in how it operates, what it does.
