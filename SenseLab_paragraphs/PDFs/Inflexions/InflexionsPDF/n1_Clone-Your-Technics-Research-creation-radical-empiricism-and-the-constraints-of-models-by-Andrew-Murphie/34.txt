Tommy - the border collie, Labrador cross in this picture - is, like all dogs, a natural and radical empiricist. He is thoroughly and unashamedly focused on the relational. For example, one of his things is to lie down with his paw over your foot as you sit on a chair, often  licking  both  paw  and  foot together so you can’t tell which is which. He is of course incomprehensible in his relatedness. Yet  he  demands  to  be  thought  with. It’s in his eager gaze.
