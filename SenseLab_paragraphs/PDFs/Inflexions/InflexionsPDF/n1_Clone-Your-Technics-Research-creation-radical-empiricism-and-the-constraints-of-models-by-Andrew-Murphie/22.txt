Technics’ freedom to impose a certain temporary order in the face of this doom tell us that order of a kind is possible - that a semblance of order can be found. However, the fact that technics can rework the order of things freely  also tells us that there is no natural sovereignty or hierarchy to forms of knowing.  Neither are disciplines nor faculties given (whether in the university or the brain/mind). It was certainly never a given that there were C. P. Snow’s famous ‘two cultures’ of science (knowing/research) and art (creation), although it is just as certain that there has never been one, but many cultures. Any order within this - even an order of preterritorialised variation - within forms of knowing has to be constantly recreated
immanently ... and technically. 1
