Although it is intuition - the passive synthesis of time and space - that is foundational here, in what is left of ontology for Kant - intuition is, first and foremost, an aspect of cognitive structure (if one strangely inside and outside of it). One’s understanding of intuited relations is determined by one’s understanding of given cognitive structures. So is the understanding of the transformation of sensed experience into perception.
