It’s a strange thing to look an animal in the eye and have it look back at you and think (although  one  will  never  know  what).  It  happened  to  me  once  with  a  polar  bear  in Copenhagen Zoo. We looked at each other from a metre and a half away, although separated by  two  rows  of  thick  steel  bars.  It  happens  too  with  Tommy.  I  remember  one  time  in particular, just playing, yet one which both Tommy’s owner and I still remember years after. Tommy loves repetition and difference in that dog way that turns simple repetition into an ongoing relation. Once when he was half-grown, we played endless chasings around a pillar in the centre of the house. The best part for Tommy seemed to be the moment when he paused on the other side of the column, looked around the corner at me, and waited for something in my eyes to give away the direction in which I’d try to catch him. This was a pause of pure relationality - no pretence at preemption or outcomes. Yet it also felt like the most agency one will ever get (that is, partial, incomplete, totally immersed in relations). Not
just becoming-dog;  becoming-chasings.
