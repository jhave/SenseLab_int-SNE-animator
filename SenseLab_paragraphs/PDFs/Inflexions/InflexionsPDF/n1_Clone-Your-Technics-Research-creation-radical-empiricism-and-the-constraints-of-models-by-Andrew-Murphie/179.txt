The first of these cultural practices related to experiment is one in which the sign - and, even more effectively, the conjunction of signs known as the model - envelopes difference in a totalising manner. To experiment here is to explore the new, but it is also to bring it to order, usually via reductive practices.  Difference is constrained in accord with a constellation of previous model-practices in order to draw out a new constraining model-practice. In the process, embodied behaviour - without which we could not imagine models or any other kind of abstraction - is put on a leash, as I hope to show shortly is precisely the case concerning Ivan Pavlovâ€™s dogs.
