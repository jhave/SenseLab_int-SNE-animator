There are other important cognitive trials, diagrams and models that have had surprising cultural effects.  Among them is what was once known as the Hebb-Hayek synaptic learning model. Donald Olding Hebb, a distinguished neuroscientist who founded the notion of the neural network, was also the scientist who pioneered research into more constrained behaviours - this time involving sensory deprivation. It is these experiments that were to form the model for torture techniques (McCoy - earlier I mentioned Ronell’s linking of torture and testing). Hayek is of course Friedrich Hayek, Margaret Thatcher’s favourite economist. Hayek’s model of cognition - outlined in a book appropriately named The Sensory Order was crucial to his theory of the market, and thus to neoclassical economics and neoliberalism. All of these start with constrained/constraining behaviours, whether of dogs, sailors or even neurons or markets, and extrapolate models from them in something of a cognitive turn. Via what Ronell has called the ‘test drive’ and other ritual activities, such as the implementation of the ‘big think’ by marketing professionals or in productivity measures, the cognitive turn
becomes the cultural turn.
