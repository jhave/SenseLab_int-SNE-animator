Signs are a question of how experience of difference (between the element of the sign and the presence of water for example) is contracted into relation and the consistency of a duration. For Deleuze, this is an active contraction - or synthesis - which occurs more in the contemplation of differences over time, than in direct action per se (which is based only subsequently upon the synthesis involved in contemplation) (Deleuze, 1994: 73). Thus the crucial nature of the contemplation of difference - of the problematic task or demand - within research-creation. Of Tommy the dog and I stopping to think in our game of chasings.
