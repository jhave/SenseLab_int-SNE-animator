Each faculty must be borne to the extreme point of its dissolution, at which it falls prey to triple violence: the violence of that which forces it to be exercised, of that which it is forced to grasp and that which it alone is able to grasp, yet also that of the ungraspable (from the point of view of its empirical exercise). (Deleuze, 1994: 143)
