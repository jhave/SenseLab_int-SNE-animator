Just  yesterday I read in the Greenpeace journal that this year they are no longer attacking whaling boats. The reason is interesting: what matters, says Greenpeace, is to convert the Japanese. Boat attacks create such negative reactions, and what interests Greenpeace is to make the Japanese think as they do. Here we see the proper being of politics in motion. Before we wanted to create an issue, to create an affair through acts of provocation and opposition. Now we enter into another phase: we must convince and turn  Japanese opinion in our favour. These are moments of one and the same cycle, of the same curve. I am reconstructing Greenpeace’s position, which seems quite subtle to me. We needed to make visible the insanity that was the scientific pursuit of whales, and we had to make ourselves seen in the media, but now we have to do something different.  We see the issue in motion, and we see the positions of those who want to move the issue change. The issue is transforming itself. And this is very interesting because it’s a mode of recharging in a certain way the definition of politics, in the banal sense of
the term. I am adding a pixel in the definition of the commons, in a certain sense. The important difference for me is first “is this object-oriented or not” (is there objective content in some sense) and secondly, does the curve
of politics, what I call the circle of the political, tie itself around this object. It’s here that politics becomes really interesting.
