I was talking to an economist this morning who was telling me: “it’s wonderful – I spent 2 weeks in Indonesia and now I really get the Indonesian economy.” He was obviously not saying that he had understood everything – this would be arrogant. He was saying that because of economization, the Indonesian economy has become susceptible to description for someone from the outside. This is what measured measures refer to – they simplify judgments, creating effects of coordination. We no longer have to go into the details of what really constitutes an economist – we just have to say what their  score is on Google and that’s it. The fundamental point Tarde makes is that this is a quantification of the qualitative, which would be a kind of classical version of an economic critique which would purport that the economy calculates while our passions are incalculable. Tarde, on the contrary, says that our passions are quantifiable and you  economists can only quantify a very small  fraction of them.
