BL: Isabelle Stengers doesn’t like us to say that there might be a link between Tarde and Whitehead since she finds Whitehead wonderful and Tarde banal… The argument is that the whole is always inferior to the parts. It’s simply that since the whole is not a superior being – this is Tarde’s argument against Durkheim – the whole is an abstraction, an extraction. To facilitate this extraction, we have measuring instruments that simplify judgment and make the social readable to itself. It’s a question that really
interests Tarde, the press. He would have been fascinated by Google and
the Internet, he would have jumped for joy, since all the elements that make the social readable to itself, including glory, reputation, appetition, purchasing are there… He would have spent hours on Amazon trying to understand why  Amazon tells you  to buy this or that, making the social traceable. This is really part of Tarde’s argument.
