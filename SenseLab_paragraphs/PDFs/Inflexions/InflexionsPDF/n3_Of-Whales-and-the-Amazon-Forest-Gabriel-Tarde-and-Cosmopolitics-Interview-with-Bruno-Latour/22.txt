EM: So the question of possession. It seems to me that when I think of possession, religion immediately comes to mind. We think of exorcism: when we are possessed, we are possessed by a force that undermines the notion of the subject, of the self as such. Is this the idea of possession we find in Tardeâ€™s work?
