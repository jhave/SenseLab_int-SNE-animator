This is my experience: I tried everything with construction, all the possible combinations for thirty years, so I have a long experience with the concept and still I never managed to make it stick. And every time I fell into the same trap, so to speak. If I had been engaged in aesthetic issues, aesthetic philosophy, as Souriau was, it would not have been such a problem. The problem is that doing constructivist work on the sciences where the distance between the constructed and the non-constructed is more vast – it’s obviously more difficult.
