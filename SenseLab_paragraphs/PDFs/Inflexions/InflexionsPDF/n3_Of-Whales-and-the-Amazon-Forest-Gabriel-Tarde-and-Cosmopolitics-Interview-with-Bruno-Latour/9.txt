BL: For Tarde there are quantities but we must always attend to the difference between measuring measure and measured measure. These are real quantities. That is to say that measured measures quantify: each monad quantifies from the moment that it evaluates and evolves as more or less. The problem is that afterwards you have to see what you can do with this real quantification.  And I’m speaking here of measuring
measures – that which affects the judgments of others. The very nice example that Tarde uses is that of the advent of the printing press – now we would say “before Google…” – before the advent of the press we didn’t know how to measure value, how to assess the respective glory of literary writers, novelists, etc. Once the printing press comes into existence, we become capable of making this judgment, which obviously does not mean that we measure the reality of what literary glory signifies – measured measure – which continues to count but in the form of a plurality of dual logics, specific to those for which there is no simplification or unity.
