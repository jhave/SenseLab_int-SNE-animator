BM:  I am trying to think of an example of a meeting with the non-human and what comes to mind is whale song. The interest in whale song erupted at a certain moment in the 1960s and was taken up and recontextualized by a number of different disciplines and domains. There were artistic engagements, mystical ones, quasi-religious responses, biological experiments, and all kinds of mobilizations and political or pragmatic position-taking – all of which emerged from  this same point of
encounter. For us, the micropolitical or transdisciplinarity are conceived as
points of emergence or irruption that differentiate themselves through different modalities, bringing with them a plurality of new problems for the public, new issues, thus  becoming nodes for negotiation and
contestation. In the end, they are regulated, but only to eventually be put back into question. This is the idea of “instauration.” Could we imagine a technique, an activity, that would correspond to this? Would this be a pragmatic philosophy? A micropolitics? An aesthetic practice in a larger sense?
