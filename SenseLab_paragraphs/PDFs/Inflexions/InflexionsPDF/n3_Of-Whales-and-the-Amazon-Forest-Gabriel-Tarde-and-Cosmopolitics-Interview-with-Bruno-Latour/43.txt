technique has everywhere been so badly understood by philosophy with the exception of a few rare cases which can be counted on one hand. The word “project” is a way of trying to avoid the notions of object, subject etc. – it’s a way of trying to make apparent an interest for technicity. As Bergson says, all philosophy is the realization of a unique project, a unique intuition.
