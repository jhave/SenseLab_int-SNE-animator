BL: No, no, I don’t think so. Not  at all. There is nothing religious in Tarde. He’s just not interested in it. He uses possession in a very technical sense, a way that fascinated Deleuze, as it does Debaise. It’s based on the argument that having is much more interesting than being for the excellent reason that when you say “I have,” you are linked to the thing you have, whereas when you say “I am” you are cut off, you are defining your identity as a subject, separately. Thus the whole argument on possession and property is important since he says that the equivalent of identity is property, what “I have.” Give me your  properties and I will tell you what you are. The notion of property in everyday language is at once what we possess and what we are, our identity. This is the paradox. To have is stronger than to be. To have is to have property, so we also have being. When we have being alone, we have nothing. This is a nice reversal. He has this famous sentence: “philosophy would have been wholly other had it worked with the verb to have rather than the verb to be.” Because the had and the having are linked while being and non-
being are separate. So I imagine the  history of philosophy with Parmenides
asking himself  not “to be or not to be” but what is the relation between the had and the having. With the had and the having we would have a completely different history of philosophy. This must have really amused Deleuze – also the notion that to exist is to differ.
