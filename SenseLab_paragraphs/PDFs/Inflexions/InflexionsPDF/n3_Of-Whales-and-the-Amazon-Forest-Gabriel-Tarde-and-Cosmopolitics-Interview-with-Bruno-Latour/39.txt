So here we reverse the idea. We say that the composition of the commons is not there yet, we have to create it, we have to compose it. And this is the cosmopolitical in the sense of the politics of the cosmos that Stengers proposes, where the political is there to prevent that cosmos become “nature” and cosmos is there to prevent that politics be occupied only by humans. In this sense, the cosmopolitical takes over the place usually occupied by nature. There is no longer any nature as such but instead a political debate about nature.
