BL: Itâ€™s a complicated question. There is perhaps a misunderstanding with respect to the human/non-human. Saying that this sociology or this philosophy is interested in human or non-human relations is not enough to bring non-humans into political thought. Relations between humans and non-humans are found as much in art as in science, in techniques obviously, in the economy, in religion. What is odd is the modernist version where the relation subject-object creates the dichotomy human/non- human. The originality of the argument does not rest in the idea that in politics we are interested in the non-human. The originality rests in making strange or unthinking, retrospectively rendering almost incomprehensible, even monstrous, the fact that humans and non-humans have been related only as subject-object.
