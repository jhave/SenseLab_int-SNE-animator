It’s evident that the economy is at the interior of ecology as an instrument of measure – in the inside of the house, so to speak. So the economy is not the world where we are, we don’t live in the economy – this is one of Whitehead’s arguments – any more that there are Galilean objects in a Euclidean space. Locally, yes,  there are Galilean objects in Euclidean space, but they don’t interweave. It is therefore incumbent on us to find the intellectual tools to understand what becomes of the measuring instruments of the economy in the house of ecology.
