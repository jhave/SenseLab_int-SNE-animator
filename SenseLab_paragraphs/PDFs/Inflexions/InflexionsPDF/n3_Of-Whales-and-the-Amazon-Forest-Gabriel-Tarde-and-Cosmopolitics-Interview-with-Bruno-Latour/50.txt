And so I engage in this search for the being of politics and I do this by focusing, as I often say, on the adverbial contrast between “speaking of politics” and “speaking politically.” It’s not the content of the proposition
but a certain twist, a certain spin that defines the political and permits us to say “there something is going and it really  is political.”
