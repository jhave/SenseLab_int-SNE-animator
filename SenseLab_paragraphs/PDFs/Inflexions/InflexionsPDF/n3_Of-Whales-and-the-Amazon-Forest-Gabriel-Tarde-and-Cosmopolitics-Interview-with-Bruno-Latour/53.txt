have in common. I find interesting in the turn  toward objects (what I call the politically-oriented-object) this idea of “give me your  issues and your movement and your  navigation and I will know something about politics.” Here the Web becomes interesting, since the Web is a good mechanism, in this regard, for measuring measure, a good way of following the development, the deployment, the confusion, the isolation and the disappearance of issues. This goes pretty well with Tarde’s early argument
– made long before the Web at the epoch of newspapers and the
beginning of public opinion and even the very concept of the public. In the end perhaps I am redefining what you call the micropolitical?
