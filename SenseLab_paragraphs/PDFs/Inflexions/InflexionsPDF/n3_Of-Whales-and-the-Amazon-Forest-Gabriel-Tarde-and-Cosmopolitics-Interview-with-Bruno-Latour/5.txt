BL : This is Tarde’s first and oldest idea. It’s the concept that kept him going throughout and right  away in his second article – the year after – he applies it to the economy. His second article is on the economy. He’s always worked with this idea that the economy is a bit like the amazonian forest: when people arrive in the amazonian forest, they think the forest is very rich and deeply rooted in the European way, while  in reality, as pedologists have shown, the amazonian forest is hung on the sky in a certain sense. It is almost ungrounded – it hangs from the top through a rapid water circulating system, the circulation of nutrients, of organic products. If you  cut the forest, the ground immediately disappears and you find that the forest is attached by its branches to the sky and not rooted into the ground. The economy for Tarde is the same. This is a metaphor but Tarde saw right  away that the economy was in fact inversed. We plunge it into what we think  of as material infrastructures when it is in fact attached or connected to what he calls « passionate interests, » that is, evaluations of belief and desire.
