BL: This is the problem: in all these questions of projects, of works, the problem is the institution. The question is how to transform the notion of the institution into a positive concept. And evidently how to create an institution capable of becoming-work (faire oeuvre) – and this is
altogether another challenge. Anti-institutionalism doesn’t help... We must
also somehow manage to rework the notion of the institution at a political level, to link instauration and institution. There is a link but to my knowledge it hasn’t been thought for a long time.
