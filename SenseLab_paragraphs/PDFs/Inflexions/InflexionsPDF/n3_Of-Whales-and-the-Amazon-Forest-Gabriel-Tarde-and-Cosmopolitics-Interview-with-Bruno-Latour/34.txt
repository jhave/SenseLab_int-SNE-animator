BL: What is it to live together? Do whales belong to the commons? Perhaps yes, perhaps no. But suddenly everyone is asking themselves political questions about all kinds of beings externalized up until now. These are really fundamental questions and, certainly, the language of economy does not deal well with them. But if we say that economics are measuring instruments, the performers for Callon – what he calls calculative devices – then we can situate them in the interior of the
political house of ecology. And behind, or beyond, or this side of it, there is the immense continent of that which we must be able to study by other methods, the economy-thing, in the sense of the uncountable relations of evaluation between subjects, between goods and words – it’s an
immense continent. It is the reversal we were speaking about earlier: the economy is like the amazonian forest, it has its roots in the sky, and so the earth is not very well known, it is evaluated very badly.
