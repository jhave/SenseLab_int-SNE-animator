ecologists up until now have not been particularly useful, and I’m speaking of professional ecologists since in the end we have here a bizarre mix of a very classical technical dream, a very modernist expert- based approach that is even apocalyptic if not religious. How  to detach from  this a political space, where politics no longer means a politics that is
founded on nature as its ground? And not a simple critique or a deconstruction. So, a definition of the political as the composition of a commons that has not yet been achieved. I think my position is quite easy to validate now – in any case, my argument holds. We cannot continue
to attempt to found politics in reason, saying “the commons is already there, it’s the universal, the rights of man, it’s a whole series of values, it’s the economy, it’s modernization, in any case things that are already there and that politics will sort out”… This is the idea of cosmopolitics in the
sense criticized by Stengers and used in David Held,  for instance, it’s
exactly that – cosmopolitical principles are born universals in a certain way.
