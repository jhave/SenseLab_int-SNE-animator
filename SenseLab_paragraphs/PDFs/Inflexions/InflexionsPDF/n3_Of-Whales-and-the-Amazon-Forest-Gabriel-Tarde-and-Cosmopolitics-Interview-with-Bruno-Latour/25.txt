BM: I wanted to return to the question of quantity since you  also lay claim to Jamesâ€™ radical empiricism and his idea that relations are as real and primitive as beings. In this thought of quantification that you  were speaking about just now, where do you place the relation? Could you bring together this Tardian way of thinking the economy with relation in the radical empiricist sense?
