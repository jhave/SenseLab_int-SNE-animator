BL: When you speak of micropolitics, are we speaking of the microphone that registers whale song? Just  kidding. Whale song is interesting. First, the dimension of the problem of whales is not defined. It changes with respect to the public. So it’s not particularly micropolitical. For the Japanese, for instance, it’s an essential problem of identity, so for them it’s not micro. Speaking of which, last week the campaign for whaling took off again, so it’s not micro at all. What concerns me about micropolitics is that it is always in rapport with the institution that  would be invested in the politics of what we call  “macro.” What we absolutely have to avoid is that the micro position itself against the political institution, when the real question
is how to deal with the political institution at all its levels.
