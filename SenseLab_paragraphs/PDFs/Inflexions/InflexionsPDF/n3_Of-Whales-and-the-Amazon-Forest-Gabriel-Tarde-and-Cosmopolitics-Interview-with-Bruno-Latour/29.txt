BL: For Tarde, economy as a science is not the house, the oikos, where we live. Our house is another oikos, the ecology. But the passage from one to the other house is difficult. First because the economy, by definition, has externalized too much and internalized only a very small proportion of the beings to “be taken into account” and, what’s more – and here we’re back to the problem we were discussing before – we are limited to the capacity of the instruments to measure what is measurable, in the sense this time of “bottom line” and “red ink.” We are missing the instruments that would permit us to take good measures.
