EM: This reminds me of the difference that Whitehead traces between appearance and reality. Appearance for Whitehead is the limited prehension, while  reality is always there in its totality but cannot be submitted to (or directly prehended) since it is unmeasurable, virtual. Would there perhaps be a link?
