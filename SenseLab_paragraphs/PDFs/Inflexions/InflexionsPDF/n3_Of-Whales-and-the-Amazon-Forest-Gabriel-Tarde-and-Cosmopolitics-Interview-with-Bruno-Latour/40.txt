Who are the ecologists who have taken up this argument? I don’t know. It’s a very complicated problem. But the main difficulty is that having undone ourselves of the question of nature, having deepistemologized politics, we now have to characterize this particular curve which is political enunciation. And this curve is very strange. We constantly rationalize it even though it’s impossible to rationalize. Or, rather, it is rational but in the sense of working within conditions that are extremely demanding. And so, we lose it all the time – we think we have it and we lose it.
