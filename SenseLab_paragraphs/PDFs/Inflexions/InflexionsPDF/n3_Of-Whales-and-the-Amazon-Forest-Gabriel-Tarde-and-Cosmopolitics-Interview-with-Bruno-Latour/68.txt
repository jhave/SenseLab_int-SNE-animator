instauration is that we leave the lexical field of critique where the notion of construction is completely immanent.  Isabelle Stengers has made a great effort to speak of constructivism in a positive way. I completely failed at
this perhaps because I tried to do it in the sciences, which is precisely the
place where it is most forbidden to speak of constructivism. Afterwards I tried to upset the balance by saying that the important question was to engage the well and badly constructed to replace the opposition between the constructed and the not-constructed. Here, it starts to look like instauration.
