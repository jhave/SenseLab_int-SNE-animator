It’s going to be a very different endeavor if you engage the political relation in a technical project, or in an artistic one, in the creation of a market or an institution. As regards the moral question, there will necessarily be a link between humans and non-humans, but the political question, the isolation of a mode of existence that is properly political, this is a complicated question that demands close attention. If you take Deleuze and Guattari in What is Philosophy, you  find that politics is not conceived as a singular mode. But you do find philosophy considered as such (this is difficult for me to understand, but this is another question). It would be interesting to use this same kind of approach to explore what is the proper being of the political. As they do for philosophy – in this case it’s the concept – and for science – where it’s the functive.  We must define this proper being of the political, no matter whether we position
ourselves on the right,  the left, the micro, the macro, the meso etc. We will
always need to be able to define something that circulates.
