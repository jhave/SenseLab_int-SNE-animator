This is quite a paradoxical argument. On  the one hand, Tarde says “the monads always quantify.” But since there are millions of monads that quantify tons of things, he admits that we will never fully be able to fully quantify due to the lack of adequate instruments. But on the other hand, when we have a measuring measure, the potential for descriptability and the judgment of others increases. For example, when my economist colleagues want to hire someone, they no longer speak about what this person does. They go instead to Google Scholar to check the “publish and perish” site and see what this person’s score is. This is exactly what interested Tarde. They grasp a tiny bit of the measure which in turn simplifies judgments, even more so due to current standardizations. This then allows for an understanding between people, which leads toward
what Michel Callon calls a performative economy (Tarde does not use this
