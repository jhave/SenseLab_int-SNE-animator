BM: You referred earlier to the curve of politics and its complexity within your thought. It emerges from an encounter with the non-human and
then there are all the vicissitudes of capture, the developments, that raise problems for the  public, all of which ends up creating a certain commons that is never beyond contestation. As a result  there is a repoliticization of already closed questions. The question this non-disciplinarity of philosophy raises concerns the fact that this encounter with the non-human remains external to or infra to these captures by the disciplines. So if philosophy is indeed the non-discipline of thought, are there political practices, assemblages, techniques which can target the pragmatic level of philosophy?
