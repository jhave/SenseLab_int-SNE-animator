BL: Yes, but the political has always been cosmopolitical so… The work around the question of the political is another undertaking. This work requires many successive operations. First, we need to liberate the political from science, separate science from the State, as the good Feyerabend would say. The political idea is very influenced by epistemology. It’s an enormous work because we always come back to the idea that we cannot found the political without turning to epistemology as a crutch. And since this dates from Plato, it won’t be transformed quickly. So, this is a first point. To detach, in a sense, the conditions of enunciations proper to the existence of politics which are very particular, of a foundational dream based on economic science, a historical science – read rhetorical – that remains a very strong aspiration for a whole slew of rationalists in every sense of the word rationalist.
