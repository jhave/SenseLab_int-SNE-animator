EM: Through Tarde, you  bring back the question of quantity. It’s an interesting problem, a complex problem for us, since where you situate the concept of quantity via Tarde, I would often replace it with quality or James’ radical empiricism. I was wondering, if we return to the context of the economy, where we’re at when the economy becomes purely speculative, when there is little or no quantity as such. In such a context, how would you situate the concept of quantity as Tarde understands it?
