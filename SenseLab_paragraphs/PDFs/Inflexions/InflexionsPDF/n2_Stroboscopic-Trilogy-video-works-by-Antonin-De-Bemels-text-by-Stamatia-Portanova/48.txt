In Deleuze’s work,  the ‘last word’ in the philosophical conceptualisation of time is neither given  by the first, repetitive synthesis of the present (the material contraction of wall-time and  video-time), nor by the pure  past as the ground for a representation of memory as ‘past’ present (Lilith as significant representation). It is rather the future which,  by allowing the constitution of a third kind  of temporal synthesis, represents time’s last word (Deleuze, 2001:
85-91). Deleuze and Guattari insist that memory plays  only a small part in art,
whose  finality  resides in an 'enlarged perception', where this perception is enlarged 'to the limits of the universe' and 'breaks with  the identity to which memory rivets  it' (Deleuze and Guattari, 2002: 166). The ambiguity consists  in the fact that whenever art appeals to memory it is, in fact, appealing to something else. Apparently connecting a contemporary present with  a distant past,  the reminiscence resolves itself into a ‘mere’ impression, something
‘common both to the past and  the present’ but more  essential than  either  of them:  a sensation. The experience of sensation is not one of continual flux, but one in which  the ‘harsh law’ of passing reality  is neutralised and the transcendental form of time (which  is not ordinarily visible to us) is given all together in an image  that makes  it sensible,  or ‘thinkable’. Beyond  its quantitative relation to quality as an experience of the present, and beyond its representational relation to memory as a figure  of the past, sensation has a direct  relation with  thought, where it becomes  the equivalent of an Idea. The last synthesis of time involved by the sensation-idea is therefore static,
because time is not subordinated to movement anymore but appears as the
virtual form of change that does not change:  Time as idea, the caesura indispensable to thought to ordain a before and  an after, to create the possibility of time, to generate the repetition of the future as the condition of
