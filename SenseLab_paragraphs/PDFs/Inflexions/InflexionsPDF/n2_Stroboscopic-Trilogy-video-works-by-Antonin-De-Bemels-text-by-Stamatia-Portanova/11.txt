“When [thinkers] see what  microscopes show  them,  they see a confirmation of it: the microscope is the instrument that gives us a sensible  and  confused presentiment of this activity  of the infinite  under any finite relation.” [2] For the visionary scientist, it did  not really matter that the dissection of compounds, molecules, atoms,  could  not go ad infinitum, insofar  as it showed a way, or a tendency, towards the infinite.  It is exactly in this sense that, if not ontologically or phenomenally, the microscopic manufacturing of light by digital video  reveals  a capacity to approach the molecularity of perception at least imaginatively, inducing our attention to wonder on the interstice, the interval, the infinity of the in-between-cut.
