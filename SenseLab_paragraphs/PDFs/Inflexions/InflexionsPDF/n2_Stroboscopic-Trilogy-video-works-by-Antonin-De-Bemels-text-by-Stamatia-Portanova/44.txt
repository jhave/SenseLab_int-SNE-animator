which  is also proper of De Bemels’ work:  the important presence of a constant framing structure for the perspectival emerging of difference, or rhythm. If
the precise  digital composition of the stroboscopic technique already provides a stable  structure to the videos of the Trilogie, the painterly quality of this
work  and its more shaded effects demand for a different framing technique. It is the reason  why  the video  needs  to be so solidly  and  tightly secured in a niche, which  becomes  the necessary structural or compositional ‘witness’ of the multiple variations, meltings and re-formations undergone by the moving image  (almost  realised as a ‘moving painting’) through the digital effects.
