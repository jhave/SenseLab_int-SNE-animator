Au quart de tour (2004, 7â€™, dancer Bruno Marin)  consists  of three different shots of the same action filmed  by two cameras on the same tripod, with  the same travelling, panoramic and zooming motions but different lights. Each of the six shots  is alternated at the rate of 1 frame  per second, only taking one frame from the first sequence, one from the second, one from the third, and so on...
In the actual  shooting, a man swings his arms against a black background, but
the final effect of the stroboscopic technique is the appearance of someone running in the dark.  As if a movement and its speed were  already virtually contained in the still body  and were actualised by the operations of the technical machine.
