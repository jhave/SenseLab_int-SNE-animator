The challenge represented by the quantitative/qualitative variation from one movement (or one scale or movement) to another, is also always accompanied by the impossibility to comprehend all the movements and  variations simultaneously and  continuously occurring in nature, like a failure  not only
of perception, but of the imagination as well. The question of whether the
digital is ontologically and  materially distant or close to the virtual, needs therefore to be replaced by a different problematic: how can a body  conceive simultaneity as an idea (and  therefore a virtuality) in itself? For Deleuze, it is only a prerogative of thought to think  the simultaneity of all movements, while perception and imagination can only give us the isolated reality  of a relative movement-section. It is what  Kant defines as the ‘mathematical sublime’: imagination trying to apprehend all the possible relative movements, with  their implied qualitative and  quantitative variations, by continuously converting its unit of measure, while thought simultaneously reaches  what  overcomes imagination and  the senses,  not the too much  or the too many  but movement as a whole,  absolute movement or the
‘unmeasurable’. [8] This second  aspect  of movement, not the present of the sequential intervals but the openness of a changing whole,  does not correspond to a succession of units  and  its velocity  but to a simultaneity and its differential speeds. Bergson  distinguishes these two aspects  as the material and  spiritual poles of movement, respectively related to a physical and a transcendental exercise of the faculties  (perception, imagination, thought): in other  words, it is never  possible to go from one to the other  and  to reach infinity,  or the wholeness and incommensurability of movement, by simply converging the unit of measure, but only by reaching towards the incommensurable in relation to every faculty.  Simultaneity appears thus  as
the impossible, imperceptible virtuality forcing  sensibility and all the faculties
to face their own limit and  reach their ‘nth’ power, or to ‘transcendentalise’ themselves (Deleuze, 2001: 141). The question is therefore how to reach, in every  sensible  entity,  this ‘nth’ power of sensitivity in itself.
