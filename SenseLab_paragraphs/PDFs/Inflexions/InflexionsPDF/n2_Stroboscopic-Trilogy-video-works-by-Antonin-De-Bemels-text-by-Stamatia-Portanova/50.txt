Lilith overflows with  time, or with different times. The repetitive mathematical working of technology and its visual  effects, the material cadence of the video loop and its lingering in the dilated time of memory, the qualities of the video and the structure of the church wall: the video  is the coexistence of all these aspects in one framed image.  But one fundamental aspect  seems  to envelop the significance of the work  in a comprehensive way: its nature of open installation, its insertion into the wider city landscape, which  at the same time constitutes its carved setting and its ‘dissolution’, its real significance and its ‘groundlessness’. Acting  as a large multidimensional frame,  the external environment enters  the compositional process, penetrating the time of the moving image  with  its own timings, and  even more  importantly, giving  it its own sounds. It is this temporal interpenetration in
the qualitative fabric of the urban setting, this juxtaposition and  mixing  of time-frames, which  makes  of Lilith a moving crystal,  an immobile image  of rhythm in itself. In the changing whole  of the landscape, its own time coincides with  the duration of an instant glimpse, a sensation. In this framing, the video  image becomes  a sign of what  we can define  as a ‘mathematical intuition’ of rhythm, a sensation and  a thought implicitly contained in the numerical understanding of light, movement and  time by digital technology, and  explicitly  actualised through its direct  contemplation of the infinite  world extending itself beyond its frame. As usually in art, everything happens in proximity to us, but beyond us.
