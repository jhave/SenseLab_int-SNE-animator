creative processes with its potential indeterminacy, a potential connection or differential relation which  is yet to come. In other  words, it can be argued that ideas  are the ‘special effects’ constituting the virtuality of the real. [4] These incorporeal effects act autonomously from their direct  physical causes, establishing a kind  of precedence that transforms them  into sufficient reasons, as “the generative conditions – the ‘meanings’ and  the ‘reasons’ – for the very processes that physically produce them.  Deleuze calls such generative after- effects “quasi-causes”” (Deleuze quoted in Shaviro’s  blog). [5] Quasi-causality is “an unreal and  ghostly causality”, more  an insinuation than  a determination, both objective  and  undetermined (Deleuze in Shaviro).  While inducing the productivity of the actual,  the paradoxical quasi-causality of the virtual represents a transcendental dimension that “neither copies the real,
nor prefigures it,” partaking only of an “extra-being” which  in itself is totally
“sterile,  inefficacious, and on the surface  of things” (Deleuze in Shaviro).
