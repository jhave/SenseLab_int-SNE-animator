The stroboscopic technique is based  on a very simple  mathematical juxtaposition of different layers in the editing program. For example, in a series of four juxtaposed layers  or shots, for the first layer, 1 frame is made visible, the remaining 3 frames  invisible. For the second:  2 frames  visible, 2 invisible. For the third:  3 visible, 1 invisible. Fourth layer: no effect. The use of this montage technique allows  De Bemels to productively engage the idea of the ‘limit’, pragmatically proposing a ‘sensational effect’ where the too small (the isolated digital bit always enveloping other  invisible micro-fragments) directly comes to coincide  with perceptual excess. In Difference and Repetition, Deleuze conceptualises two different ways  to deal with  the idea of the limit (Deleuze, 2001: 148-153). The first way is quantitative and  qualitative: in this sense, digitisation becomes  a possibility towards the production of the ‘too many’ and  the ‘too fast’ which,  in relation to the limited scale of human perception, are already proper of matter in its molecular composition. The human limit appears thus  as much  more  ‘limited’ and less comprehensive than technological capacity in itself. Thanks  to its analytical and  selective function, human perception can capture the infinitely repeated vibrations of light and  heat, contracting an unbearable multiplicity into a unified image: trillions of external oscillations need  to be condensed, or filtered, into a millisecond colour  vision. [7] Every sensorial interface acts as a reality
‘converter’, translating, or ‘trans-ducing’, one velocity  into another, one scale
of movement into another, and producing the different degrees of clarity at which  the material world appears to us.
