[1] Deleuze and  Guattari define  the ‘machinic  phylum’ as “matter in movement, in flux, in variation, matter as a conveyor of singularities and traits  of expression” (Deleuze and  Guattari, 2002b: 409). In other  words, the
definition of the phylum is more related to the ontogenetic value  of the matter in itself, than  to the different ontologies of the different codifications and moldings it undergoes throughout its movements. For this reason, it seems important to understand, or rather to follow, the matter-flow of light as the particular material constituting the cinematographic phylum, throughout its different analog  or digital variations.
