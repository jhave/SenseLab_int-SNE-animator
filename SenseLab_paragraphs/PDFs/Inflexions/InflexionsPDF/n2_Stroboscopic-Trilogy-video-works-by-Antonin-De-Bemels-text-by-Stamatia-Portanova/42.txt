In some of Bacon’s works,  such as Head VI (1949) or Figure Standing at a Washbasin (1976), the body’s  effort to escape through the basin pipe, or even through its own mouth, is caught as a movement which  is not provoked by any external impulse but originates and happens in the body itself (Deleuze,
2002c: 41). In the body,  or in its painted materiality: the effort is therefore not
so much  represented, as it is materially conveyed through the paint  brushes and  their coposition, as a tendency or a virtuality of the figure and of paint itself, an intensity going beyond the body’s capacities not so much  because of its ‘un-realizability’, but in the sense of proclaiming its ‘inactuality’ or ‘in- actualisation’ (the virtual as always being too much,  in temporal excess with respect to its possible actualisations on a canvas).  The paint-figure is caught in the spasm of a tendency, an intense immobile effort which  is too much  for its limited actuality and for the limited space of a framed rectangular surface. This effort is made  visible as the hysterical moment of the figure  pushing
hard to leak and  reach the material structure, to finally dissolve in it... All the
gradual passages undergone in preparation of the escape are conveyed by the simultaneously careful  and chaotic  composition of the artistic  material, by the diagrammatic distribution of paint,  as ‘sensations’. The passages between levels, orders or fields of sensation, constitute the painted rhythm of the work.
