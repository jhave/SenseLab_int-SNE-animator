Following Nietzsche, Deleuze defines ‘differenciation’ as a form of reciprocal determination between magnitudes (to be intended here as the different forces of attraction of ideas),  of which  one is always superior to another (Deleuze, 2002a: 61). As Nietzsche himself  reminds us in his late writings, the tendencies (or virtualities) of matter have their  own qualities, a ‘qualitability’, as Deleuze defines it, which  is the evidence of an emerging difference, the apparitional consequence of an irreducible material inequality that the philosopher can paradoxically understand (or critically  evaluate) through
‘metric scales and  numbers’ (Nietzsche quoted in Deleuze, 2002a: 65). In other words, the quality of a force is nothing more  than  the corresponding perceptible evaluation of a quantitative difference between magnitudes. As a consequence, qualities become  measurable, or interpretable, along  numerical scales (which  for the philosopher represent the only instrument of critical discernment free of any ‘too human’ intellectual, emotional or phenomenological bias). Nietzsche’s extreme affirmation clearly highlights how the problem never  resides in metric  quantification per se, but in its scientific use according to homogenising parameters that only reduce difference to identity. In this way, the Nietzschean paradoxical reconciliation of quantity and quality in the virtual field (quantitability and qualitability), is the pre-condition for the inevitable split between the qualities-quantities in
the actualised world.
