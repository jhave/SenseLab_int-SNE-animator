Rather  than  just being reducible to a simple  process  of quantitative filtering (a measurement, distinction and  selection  of particles), transduction implies qualitative change. We can paraphrase this argument in Deleuzian terms, considering the two aspects, the numerical quantification of particles and  the qualitative transformations implied by their passages, as two actualisations of the same effect. Qualitative difference thus  becomes  the corresponding value of a variation in the ‘unit of measure’ (from light and its own unit of measure to the digital metrics,  from light to our senses and  brain)  (Deleuze, 2002b: 56-
66). In the passage, it is always possible to count  and  discern particles ad
