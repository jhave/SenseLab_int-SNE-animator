[7] In the 1950s, Henri  Bergson defined the brain  as a central  telephonic operator: more  than  a centre  of conscious representation, the cerebral membrane appeared to him like a switchboard letting  only a small amount of information pass through, while  relaying the rest. See Bergson  (2002).
[8] On the Kantian notion  of ‘mathematical sublime’,  see Deleuze (2002b). [9] On the ‘line’ of difference in itself, see Deleuze (2001: 29). On the idea of
the sensation as cut or ‘caesura’, see Deleuze (2002: 78-79).
