The digital technique used  for Lilith is not that of the stroboscope: the whole work  is based  on a series of meltings, traces and  blurs  obtained through various digital effects reproducing the techniques of ‘long exposure’ or ‘slow shutter’. Another technique used  in this piece is what  De Bemels defines as
‘déformation temporelle’: a calculation of additional frames  interpolated to
create smooth slow motions from normal speed sequences (some kind  of
‘morphing’ technique, but applied between frames  and  to a whole  sequence). The overall  effect is therefore more textural, painterly and  ‘shaded’ than  the sharp cut style of the Trilogie Stroboscopique. The author himself  mentions some of Francis Bacon’s paintings as the main ‘ideas’ at the basis of his work, and  apart from the obvious representational similarities and  technical differences between the two works,  a series of interesting parallels seem to emerge on the compositional level. Immediately, we recognise the three basic elements characterising the composition of this video: the material structure
of the church, the frame  or contour of the niche, and the video  positioned in it,
three  fundamental features appearing as the creative variations of a
‘Baconian’ compositional schema...  (Deleuze, 2002c).
