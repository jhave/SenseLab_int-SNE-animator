In De Bemels’ microscopic video-choreographic cinema,  a particular quality seems  to emerge from digitisation and its precise  mathematical functioning. Through the use of a deterministic binary metrics,  digital technology divides and  ‘interprets’ electromagnetic energy according to a precise  scale, measuring movement along  a linear  spatialisation of time, for example through the sequential alignment of frames: a code accompanying a quantitative increase coinciding with  a qualitative modification. From analog cinema  to its digital transduction, the quantity of space and  time containable in the in-between cuts increases: the frames  multiply themselves, giving  a different velocity  and an amplified possibility of re-combination to the montage techniques. This qualitative modification does not only relate  to the different velocities  obtained in movement, but to a different way to perceive and  ‘treat’ it: while  the software produces particular realisations through its numerical code, it is the virtuality of the cut as a ‘special effect’ that moves technology and  its quantitative and  qualitative actualisations.
