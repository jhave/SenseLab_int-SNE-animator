What  happens to architecture if the horizon bends  and  closes into a circle? How can the  human being  identify its location  when “up” and  “down” are  replaced by “center” and  “periphery,” when the relation to the ground is lost and  the emptiness of the sky becomes  ubiquitous? The space  station Continuous Horizons investigates how  to satisfy  basic human exigencies of orientation, and  visual  and haptic  stimulation in the absence  of planet earth.
