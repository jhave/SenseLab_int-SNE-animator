The sphere is the  simplest, purest volume. Unoriented, without focus.  It is only the interruption of the continuous surface  and  the relation to other  volumes that gives  it definition. Thus,  it is ideal  for  the  study of orientation and  hierarchy. While  the  interior  of  one  spherical  volume  can  be  viewed at  a  glance   and provides an  archaic  feeling  of wholeness and  calmness, the  layered depth of a deep,  sponge-like structure  animates to  explore,   passing by  complex exterior, interstitial spaces.
