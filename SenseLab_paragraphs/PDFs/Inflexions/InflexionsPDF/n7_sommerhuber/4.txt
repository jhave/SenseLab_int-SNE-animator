The  station  is  composed  from   a  ring-shaped  agglomeration  of  intersecting spheres  and   rotates  to  provide  artificial   gravity.  The   inhabitants  are   fully immersed in  the  centrifugal force  and  cannot  perceive it,  but  the  spheres are deformed collectively as if through the rotation and thus  indicate directionality.
