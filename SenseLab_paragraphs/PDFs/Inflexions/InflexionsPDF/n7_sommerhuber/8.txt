The  main  level  continues all around the  station. On  two  opposing sides,  three more  levels  are  inscribed into  more  fragmented zones  where a  multitude of overlaid  volumes  open   up   to   each   other.   Towards  the   rotation  centre,   a multitude of apertures allow  the  inhabitants to  view  the  opposite side  of the station and  eventually to spot  other  beings.  Sun  light  penetrates the  windows, illuminates these  central  activity  zones,  casts  light  spots  that  continuously run over the interior surfaces, creating an effect similar  to a disco ball. In outer  space, where endless darkness starves the  human eye, these  moving spots  of sunlight provide  a  vital   visual   stimulus.  To  satisfy   the   haptic   sense,   some   spheres, especially in the peripheral, darker, more introverted zones, do not feature floors. Instead, they  are  filled  with   water, sand,   upholstery, rubber, etc.  With  their curved surfaces, that  transition smoothly from  floor to seating to wall,  these experience rooms  invite  to engage with  the offered  materials in various positions and using  the entire  body.
