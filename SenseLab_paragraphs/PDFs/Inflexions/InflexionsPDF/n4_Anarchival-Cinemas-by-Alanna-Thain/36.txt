world that  is interiority:   “I am surrounded by me and  my  mind is surrounded by me”, and  “my mind goes out in the world and  then  comes back inside  of me”. That  this  is not  a closed  circuit,  or an  opening of a bounded interiority, comes across  in  her  statement that  “sometimes I say  the  first  part  and  my  mind is stimulated by  a  new   direction”.    Both  the  video   and   Holt  share   a  sensory derangement;  Holt  describes her  audition, here  reduced and  minimized to  a world held  in the embrace of the headphones, as a feeling  of “eat(ing) words”, a synaesthetic serialization of incorporation, an indistinction of the aural  and alimentary canals,  or better  yet, a mutation of their  functionality.
