1  As an example of such  sampling, we might  consider Christian Marclay’s Video Quartet      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VmXoeZir7A     (2002),     which combines  clips   from   multiple  Hollywood  musicals  projected   on  four   large screens  arranged horizontally along  a single  wall.   Here,  the  sampling of clips doesn’t simply decontextualize them  in order to tell a narrative history, as in a film like That’s Entertainment!,  (1974) or to make  explicit  an implied alternative logic  as  in  the  queer  compendium The Celluloid Closet (1995).   Marclay’s  work functions both  as display of archive that  plays  off of the pleasures of recognition, while   simultaneously  making  felt  the   emergence  of  newness,  as  the   clips generate an audio-visual entity  of the installation in fluctuating tension with  the discrete clips.    A 2002 review cites  Benjamin  Weil,  the  piece’s  commissioning curator from  San Francisco’s Museum of Modern Art noting that  “’Christian did this with  a home  computer, but  two  years  ago that  couldn't have  happened, the materials weren’t available at the consumer level.’ Had  the piece been edited the old-fashioned professional way,  on  an  Avid  system, said  Weil,  ‘it  would have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.’”; such  avant-garde sampling is available to anyone today with  a laptop, though single  screen  juxtaposition  remains the norm  in popular uses such as fanvids on YouTube  (Helfand).
