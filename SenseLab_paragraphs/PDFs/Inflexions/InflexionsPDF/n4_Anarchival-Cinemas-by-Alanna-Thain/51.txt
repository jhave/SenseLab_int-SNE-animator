I could  see that  some  other  people appeared to have  the same  set of instructions as  me,  albeit  at  a staggered time  delay.    At  first  I kept  wondering if I should listen  to the  voice,  whether it was  reasonable to be so passive, but  in fact, I did not  feel passive at all.   For one  thing,  I was  clearly  part  of a choreography that was  neither improvised nor  rehearsed--a decidedly unusual experience and  one with  a distinct and  distributed temporality.  Secondly, the  intimacy of the  non- deboned voice  in my  head  made  my  movements and  my  body  into  a resonant space;  I  became   for  the  time  being   a  hollow body   with   a  distinct sense   of standing apart from  myself  while  being  fully  in control  of my  actions  as well. This  apartness  was   doubly  resonant,  both   in  the   unfolding  echoes   of  my movement  alongside the  other   participants  in  the  space   and   in  the  interior occupation of my body.   In other  words, I felt myself  engaged in what  Whitehead terms  “prehension”, the  activity  before  action.   While  the  first  half  of the  piece was active--do this, do that--eventually I was “shot” and  instructed to crumple to the floor.  After a while,  some people came and  dragged me to a different part  of the  room,  and  the  sound changed from  physical action  to  mental imagery via detailed descriptions of scenarios, inducing in me an almost  hallucinatory state of virtual doing. As I lay there,  I was dreaming the visuals of this strictly  aural description into being.   This was my first experience in the piece of a becoming- cinematic.
