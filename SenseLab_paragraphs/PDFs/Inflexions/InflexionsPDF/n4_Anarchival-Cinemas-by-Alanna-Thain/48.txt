The  Other   Theatre  is  a  Montreal-based  experimental  performance  company founded by Stacey Christadoulou. For Spiral Jetty, she collaborated with  architect Enrique Enriquez and filmmaker Tamara Scherbak,  producing a piece which exploited the time lag characteristic of cinema  to reanimate the immediacy of live experience in such a way as to call attention to expansive and  intensive modes of embodiment.  Inspired by Robert  Smithson and  in particular his site-specific installation   Spiral   Jetty   (1970),   the    Other    Theatre  sought   to   develop   a participatory performance using  MP3 players that  would transform audio experience “into both an internal and  external cinema”.  In April  2009, I joined  19 strangers, in  an  abandoned  church now  converted to  a  contemporary dance studio.  We were  each  given  an MP3 player and  told  to follow  the  instructions. At  first  these  were  simple  and  even  banal--walk around the  space,  raise  your right  arm  in the air, stand in a circle around the jacket.   In this clip, you  can see and  hear some of what  took place.
