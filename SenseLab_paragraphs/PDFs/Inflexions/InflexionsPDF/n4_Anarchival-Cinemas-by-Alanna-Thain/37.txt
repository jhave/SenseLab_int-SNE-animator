Holt and  Serra’s video  intensifies and  isolates  one sense in order to intensify synaesthetic confounding.   In  “Anxious Loves”,  Sean  Cubitt   writes,   “Cinema prefers the closure  of sound into an inward-directed stereophony which  imitates not  the  world as soundspace through which  one  moves  altering the  sound, but the  imaginary fullness of  a  consciousness at  the  assured centre  of  its  world” (1998).  How  might  we imagine a different cinematic effect that  asks us to think carefully about  cinematic hearing--a technological audition?   More  importantly, what  would this  tell  us  about  cinema’s  demeasured place  in  the  world?   This video,  itself an example of the non-newness of cinema’s  ambiguous place, stages through headphones a  different  kind   of  audio-visuality  than   the  one  Cubitt describes as characteristic of institutionalized cinema.
