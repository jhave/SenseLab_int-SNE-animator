Our  engagements with  media allow  us  to  experience our  corporeality via  an intensive extension.  By this,  I mean  an extension of the body  that  is not simply spatial,  but  one  that   works   via  the  resonance  of  affective   encounter on  the incorporeal dimension of the body,  allowing us to sense the bodyâ€™s ongoing becoming.  This intensive extension doubles our  sense  of immediate perception, introducing a  perceptible  delay   into  experience,  a  minor   gap.     No  longer   a question of a perceiving subject  and  a perceived object, this intensive extension makes  relation felt as a resonant reserve of potential.
