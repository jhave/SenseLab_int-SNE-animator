Against every  scenario which  asserts  the  dematerialization of the audiovisual, its  reduction to  information and  virtuality, we  must note  the contemporary explosion of artifacts.  Quasi-cinematic toys and   trinkets,  portable  storage  and   display  devices   and   other material props of an audiovisual culture have  proliferated, each offering  images  and  sounds in distinctive ways  dependent on their own  technological complexity and  purposes.  As screens  take  their place  in the  corners of our  kitchen or in a range  of transportation vehicles,   they  mark   and   define   space  in  ways  which   belie  their status  as   simple    carriers  of   an   information  whose    origin    is elsewhere.   As  much   as  these  proliferating screens   invite   us  to rethink the status of audiovisual information, they  suggest that  we consider new  ways  in which  that  information comes  to be attached to space (118).
