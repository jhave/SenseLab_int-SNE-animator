In  part  this  essay  comes  from  a  set  of  speculations inspired by  this  clip,  an instance of  a  contemporary mobile  media in  several   ways.    That  was  David Lynch,  in  an  interview ripped and  remixed into  a cheeky  commercial for  the iPhone  from  the  “bonus” material on  the  two  disc  set  of Inland Empire (2006). Beyond  Lynch’s impassioned rejection  of cell phone cinema,  the clip alone  raises the  question, where exactly  is  the  event  of  cinema  today?   In  what   way,  for example,  does   such   extra-theatrical  bonus  material  count   as   part   of   the “eventness” of a film like Inland Empire?  How  does  the circulation of this clip on YouTube  cannibalize and  reanimate a conceptual persona like Lynch who  stands in for a very specific type of cinematic experience?
