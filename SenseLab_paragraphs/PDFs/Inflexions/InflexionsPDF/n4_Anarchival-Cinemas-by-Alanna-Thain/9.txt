mobile   immersive  media.    Actually, strolling  around  the  city,  immersed  in choosing the screen  and  choosing a song on my iPod,  I’ve somehow managed to survive, largely  by a cross-purpose sampling of the  screen  and  surroundings as my   eyes   assessingly  flicker   back   and    forth.       Such   sampling  is   indeed characteristic of contemporary cinema,  its disjunctive database exploited in museum  installations and   the  remix   culture  of  live  cinema,   two   prominent examples of a newly  mobile  contemporary cinema.1 [1]   We should remember that  the “violent threat” to the body  in its incorporation of media technologies is not  merely the  stuff  of media fantasy but  also  of disciplinary control,  and  we might   ask  instead, what   else  is  possible from  this  disjunctive  articulation of sensing body  and reproductive media? Why think  of this as a blind  spot, or if we do, how  might  we think  of other  cross modal sensory perceptions that  might  be re-attuned in creative compensation?
