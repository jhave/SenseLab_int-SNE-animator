In  describing the  diagram that  doubles and  disrupts the  archive in  Foucault, Deleuze  speaks   of   a   return  to   an   anonymous  murmur  underpinning  an authorized  and   determining  relation  between  the  seen   and   the  said   in  the archive,  the  basis  of  representation  and   interpretation.   Such  an  anonymous murmur emerges in the  doubled resonance of Nancy  Holt’s  self-perception, in the  hesitation  of  pedestrian  movement in  Kaiser  and   Eshkar’s  piece,  in  the automatic cinema  produced by the  Other  Theatre’s headphone choreographies. In Maddin’s film, such  a murmur emerges in the  superposed mappings of city and  self  via  cinema.      In  the  multiplex strangeness of this  encounter, we  can perhaps see  the  place  of  a  spatially uncoordinated  cinema   dispossessed of  a singular space, and keys in hand, wandering errantly, making itself at home.
