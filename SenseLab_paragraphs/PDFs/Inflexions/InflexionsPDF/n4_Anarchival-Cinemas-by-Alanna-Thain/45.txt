Part   of  that   inhumanity,  I  would  argue, stems   not  from  the  interface  with technology, but  from  the  renewed sensitivity to environmental agents,  and  not just other  people.  One  reads  here  both  the  echo  of Deleuzeâ€™s control  society  of modulation, in which  the doctrine of flexibility  takes  the guise  of agentic  choice in order to produce a frequently brutal availability, adaptation and  alterfication, but   also   another  potential  in  the   absorption  of  flows   which   sparks  not   a conservative flexibility  but a monstrous mutation.
