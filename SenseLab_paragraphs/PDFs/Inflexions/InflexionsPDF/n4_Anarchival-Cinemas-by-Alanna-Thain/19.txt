As the  space  of cinema  becomes  increasingly redistributed in part  due  to its in- and  ex-corporations of digital technology, we might  think  of this process as a de- measuring of the place of cinema,  no longer  definable by a Cartesian positioning, discrete  subject/object  relations,  or  the  centered  orientation  of  a  perceiving subject.   This de-measuring includes the loss of a space  that  provides a singular external orientation for a spectator.  Gilles Deleuze identifies such  a loss of scale at work  in a form of cinema  in which  there  is no longer  any “out  of field”, that  is to say the  creation of a contiguous space  that  continues outside of the  frame  of the shot.   “The organization of space here loses its privileged directions, and  first of all the privilege of the vertical  which  the position of the screen  still displays, in favour  of  an  omni-directional  space   which   constantly  varies   its  angles   and coordinates, to exchange the vertical  and  the horizontal” (Deleuze 1989, 265).
