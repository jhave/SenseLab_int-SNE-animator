In Shelley Eshkar  and  Paul  Kaiserâ€™s 2002 digital installation Pedestrian, originally created as an homage to New  York city following the 9/11 attacks,  synthespians (digitally created  actors)  produced  through  motion capture technology move through a city space  projected from  above  onto  a sidewalk or gallery  floor.   In this work  of digital projection as public  sculpture, these  de-measured characters reanimate walking in the city via a vertiginous compression of perspectives and orientations.  The piece  folds  the horizontal and  vertical  axis, creating a moving sidewalk  that   brings    the   view   from   above   to   street   level.	 This   digital embodiment of the synthespians is thus  doubled for the viewer, their  pedestrian movement  that   negotiates  an   immediate  perception  of  the   actual   situation interfacing and interfering with  a memory image  sampled from the modern archive, the iconic image  of the city from  a skyscraper and  the tiny  people down below.
