The  double audition of  écouteur--both  listener and   headphones--refers to  the double articulation of a new  mode  of embodiment.  Marcel  Duchamp once  said that  you  can  see seeing,  but  you  cannot hear  hearing.  To hear  hearing, as we might  in this  double audition is to stretch open  the  reconfiguration of the  body that  merely speaking puts  into proximity.  When  we speak,  we do hear  a double audition, both  the  vibration carried through air to the  ear  but  also our  voice  as conducted by  bone  and   body   to  the  inner   region   of  the  ear,  an  intracranial sensation.  As Douglas Kahn describes this, a speaker hears  one voice, but others hear it deboned; thus   “the presence produced by voice always entails  a degree of delusion” (2001, 7).  What  is if we are not  simply deluding ourselves, however, but  engaging with  what  Deleuze calls the powers of the false, a double audition that  repeats the  self, an auto-audition as auto-affection of the  self, that  sense  of becoming other  to what  we have been?2  [2]
