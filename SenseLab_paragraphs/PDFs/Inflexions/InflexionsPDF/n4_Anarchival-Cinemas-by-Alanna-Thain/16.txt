As I attempt to sketch  a few affective  cartographies of the place of cinema  today, I  want  to  draw on  Gilles  Deleuze’s  notion of the  diagram, in  particular as  he develops it in relation to the  work  of Michel  Foucault, to suggest that  today we are  we  experiencing a topological relation to cinema.    A topological relation is one defined by folding;  it is one of multiple folds.   Thus one way we could  think about  the place of cinema  today is to move  away  from the concrete actualizations of multiplexes, characterized by  a division into  units  that  can  be multiplied, a disciplinary simultaneity that  restricts cross-movie sampling and  relationality, and  a historical separation of cinema  from  the  flows  of urban space,  towards a virtualization of the  multiplex, as the  reanimation of its Latin  root  in the  word “to fold”,  a multiplicity of perspectives.  How,  where and  when might  we sense such  multiplex cinematic foldings?  To think  about  the  place  of cinema  now  is also  to  think  about  the  potential for  cinematic modes of subjectivation,  modes that,  like the cinematic medium itself, may gain strange new  possibilities in their attenuation  from   institutional  practices and   habitual  encounters.    Too  often cinema  is thought of as an escape  from reality,  a source  of illusory experience, or even  a technique for cannibalizing the real.   How  can we think  otherwise about that   strange  doubling  of  immediate  experience  that   we   might   have   in  an experience of becoming-cinematic?
