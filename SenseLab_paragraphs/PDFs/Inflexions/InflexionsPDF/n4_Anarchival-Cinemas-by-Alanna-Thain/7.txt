recent   Hollywood  trilogy   (Lost  Highway  (1997),  Mulholland  Drive  (2001)  and Inland Empire), in which  Hollywood as real  place  becomes  a topological site  of incommensurable  yet  indistinguishable  relations  between  the  acted   and   the lived,  onscreen and  off, dream and  waking life, studio and  location,  and  film and video.    His tirade emerges from  the discomfiting friction  between the divergent series   of  a  notion of  a  properly  cinematic experience and   the  host   of  new technologies implicated in a new  media and  the mutant reproduction of cinema. As cinema  stutteringly incorporates and  is excorporated by digital technologies, these  divergent series  extend our  own  corporealities via  intensity, what  Anna Munster  describes  as  an  extension  that   is  not  itself  corporeal  (as  with,   for instance, prosthetics) but “comprising an intensive capacity for being  affected  by the diverse speeds, rhythms and  flows of information” (2006, 19).    The effect of this,  she  notes,  is an  “extensive vector  that  draws embodiment away  from  its historical capture within a notion that  the  body  is a bounded interiority” (33). While Lynch’s words resonate deeply with  me, I am not sure  I want  to so easily dismiss a  new  mode   of  embodiment that  the  small  screen  of  portable media might  produce as a cinematic architecture.  What  happens when we re-imagine the  event   of  cinema   as  no  longer   characterized  by  a  spatially  discrete  and immersive place,  but  in  terms  of  the  relationality of bodies  moving in  space- time?     Another,  more   practical question  might   be:  will  we  ever  be  able  to navigate mobility while  immersing our  eyes in the  ways  that  we do now  easily with  the disjunctive ears of headphone listening? Imagining this I thought, there is only one way that this could  end: roadkill.
