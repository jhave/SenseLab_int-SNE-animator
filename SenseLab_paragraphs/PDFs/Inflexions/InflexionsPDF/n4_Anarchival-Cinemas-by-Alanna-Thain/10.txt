Walter   Benjamin’s  cautious  proposition  in  “The  Work   of  Art  in  the  Age  of Mechanical  Reproduction”  for  the   radical   possibilities  of  the   distraction  of cinema  is re-emerging as mobile  screens  mutate out of portable listening and communications devices  and re-orient our attention away  from the exclusive immersion of face to face encounter (both  with  other  people and  also  with  the screen).    A mobile  cinema  might  not be a simple  extension of the atomization of crowds  immersed  in  private  worlds  of  media  and   communication,  but   can provide  a  critique  of  “interfaciality”  as  interactivity  that   dominates contemporary ideas  about  active  spectatorship.  Lynch’s outburst shows  that  the question of where is cinema  today is one of affective  urgency and  its counterpart, uncertainty.  Affect is a sign  of a hesitation of habitual response, the  embodied engagement before  information.   Cinema today is out  of place,  or  rather, it is multiply positioned in a vertiginous explosion of possibilities.    My question is not  how  can  we  fix the  place  of cinema  today, but  what  is the  potential of a cinema   out   of  scale,   one   whose   contemporary  expansion  and   contraction produces a becoming–cinematic in unanticipated ways.
