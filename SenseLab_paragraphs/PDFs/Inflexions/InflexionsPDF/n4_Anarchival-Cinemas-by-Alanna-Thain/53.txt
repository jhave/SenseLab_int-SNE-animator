standing aside  from  myself,  and  recording without registering my  engagement with  the  world.	 Such  automated  choreography, a  guiding of  perception and affective  modulation, is deeply familiar from watching movies.   Spiral Jetty made explicit  the  kind  of directed attention that  editing, framing and  soundtrack do implicitly by pre-selecting which  elements of a shots  are  crucial.    However, by juxtaposing  such   explicit   selection  (imagine  this,   picture  that)   with   a  long sequence where we were  left to dream our  own  guided imagery reveals  that  lie at the  heart  of apparatus theory, which  sees cinema  as a mechanical production of standardized effects, ignoring the haze  of potential that  every  spectator brings on-scene.	Instead,  Spiral  Jetty  makes   apparent this  potential of  a  machinic producer of  difference, where  the  machinic is  the  term  for  articulation.	 The active  passivity of Spiral Jetty also  shows  the  limits  of a critique of cinema  that posits  its salvation only in “interactivity”, such  as “choose  your  own  adventure” models of fragmented narratives.  I myself  was the recording device  in the piece, playing back my affective  sensation at a delay  as with  Nancy  Holt.   What  would it  mean   to   understand  a  becoming-cinematic  of  space   as   a   hallucinatory experience?	Would this  not  simply return us  to  a simple  sense  of subjective experience? Where  is the dissonant self that can become  other  than  what  it was? As a coda to these,  I want  to come back to the scene of the screen  and  a different mode   of  walking that,  like  the  transversal experiments of  the  Other   Theatre, Pedestrian  and   others,   is  an  affective   cartography  of  cinema   today,  from   a filmmaker best known as a memory worker.
