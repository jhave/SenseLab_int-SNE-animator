Walking on the swarming sidewalks of a city like New  York, have you ever had  the feeling—this is a personality test—that you were: a)  an  unconscious performer in  a  complex but  unacknowledged dance,  or b) a cell in a von  Neumann-like self-organizing system? Either  sensation could  have  come  from  your  simultaneous recollection of having looked down earlier,  from  a high  office  or apartment building, at the transitory patterns formed by the pedestrians below,   who   couldn’t  help   but   remind you  of  ants. Down   on   the   streets,   however,  you   can   forget   about   overall patterns for a moment and  concentrate on the singular, shifting, unrepeatable beauty of each “ordinary movement” as it unfolds before you.    This is to look at the street with dance  eyes, I suppose—though  long   before   I’d  acquired  such   a  thing,   I  was finding the same beauty with  film eyes (111-12).
