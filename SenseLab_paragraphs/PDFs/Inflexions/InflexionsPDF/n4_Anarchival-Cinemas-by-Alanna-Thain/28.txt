For   Kaiser,   the   key   problem  and   potential  he   worries  over   in   mediated movement lies in what  he understands as technology’s ability  to abstract motion from the body,  an excorporative theft.   If we imagine the abstraction he describes less as an excorporative theft,  and  more  as the  generative action  of the diagram (which  Deleuze also  calls  the  abstract machine), we  can  better  understand the way  that  Kaiser’s  words turn  in  on  themselves as  the  marker of  change.   In Foucault, Deleuze argues that  diagrams “never function in order to represent a persisting world but  produce a new  kind  of reality,  a new  model of truth…It makes  history by  unmaking preceding realities and  significations, constituting hundreds of points of emergence or creativity, unexpected conjunctions or improbable continuums. It doubles history with  a sense  of continual evolution” (35).      In   other    words,  the   diagram  or   abstract  machine  provokes   new articulations in an  existing  social  field  by abstracting virtual potential, creating new  assemblages.  As Deleuze and  Guattari write  in A Thousand Plateaus: “There is  a  diagram  whenever  a  singular  abstract  machine  functions  directly  in  a
