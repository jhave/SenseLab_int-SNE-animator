In French,  the Walkman is a baladeur. In his books on cinema,  Deleuze draws on a double sense of bal(l)ade—both the song and  to stroll, to propose a certain  type of detoured wandering that for him, characteristic of a cinema  coming  unmoored from a spatial determination and  habitual extension of action.3 [3]  I’d like to take such   a  detour  now,   to  explore   how   the  mobile   écouteur might   reanimate  a cinematic archive and  the  synecdoche of  the  screen.    In  short,  what  happens when we  think  the  cinematic medium through headphones? In  keeping with Munster’s suggestion that  the mobile  écouteur might  be the figure  of new  media aesthetics, I want  to look briefly at an event  based  on the MP3 player that  for me, reanimated the  cinematic archive;  the  Other  Theatre’s Spiral Jetty.   Through its use  of the  ambiguous embodiment of headphone listening and  almost hallucinatory evocation of what  we  might  term  a virtual ecology  of the  audio- visual  screen,  my experience in the participatory event  of Spiral Jetty powerfully produced a new existential territory for thinking cinema.
