With  the  emergence of portable media devices  like the  Walkman and  the  iPod, we  are  granted  access  to  an  immersive  experience  that   promises  subjective control  in  terms  of affective  modulation over  our  surroundings--if not  exactly earlids, an aural  environment.  However, I’m less interested in starting from  the question of  the  subject   than   I  am  from   the  question of  sociality   and   social relations.    To  do  so,  it  is  crucial   not  to  understand  immersive headphone listening as an  act of disembodiment or  disengagement, but  as a discontinuity that   activates  the   potential  for   producing  new   kinds   of  connection.    The immersive listening of headphones may  reawaken us  to elements of the  visual field in all their  strangeness and  the potential of delay.   The affective  mobility of headphone listening reminds us of Bergson’s claim that “real movement is rather the transference of a state than  of a thing” (202).
