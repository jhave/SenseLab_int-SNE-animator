Form  and  expression become   increasingly  indistinct  in  his  work,   and   it  is  ironically through  the cinematic self-portrait of  “Guy  Maddin” that  he  approaches Foucault’s “anonymous  murmur”,  redistributing  consistency and   heterogeneity.    This trilogy  is marked not only by an obsessive attempt to explore  the past  of context but also through experiment with  cinematic forms  from the early  days  of cinema culture,  including  live  orchestration  and   narration,  installation  of  peephole cinemas.  This following clip is from  the delightful My Winnipeg, commissioned by the Documentary channel, is a diagram of that city shot through at every  level with  the  uncanny liveliness of the  media archive.  If Maddin’s films have  often figured Winnipeg as the radiant heart  of a continent, as in his recent  short  Night Mayor (2009), My Winnipeg is an attempt to make  sensible  the virtualities underpinning, intersecting and  resonating amidst the affective  and  actual cartographies he describes.
