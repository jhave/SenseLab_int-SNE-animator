possibility extend well  beyond the  new  tools  for  creation and  exhibition, and disrupt  communication itself.	 As  Brian  Massumi  has   argued:	“When  the communicational medium ceases to be transparent and  perforce stands out in its materiality, information blends into  perception.	 Information then  precedes its understanding:  it is experienced as  a dimension of the  confound before  being understood and  used  and perhaps lending itself to invention” (2001, 1082). Deleuze’s concept of the diagram and  his topological aesthetics offer us a way to articulate such  an  experience of  the  twisting and  folding of  information into perception.  Our  perceptions are not  of a world, but  immediately part  of it, in a space-time that  changes as  we  move  through it  in  an  immanently relational configuration.  The diagram is deforming: if the archive is a “history of forms”,  as Deleuze writes  in his study of Foucault, it is “doubled by an evolution of forces”, or the diagram (43).  A diagram does  not only map  existing  actualized forms  nor what  Deleuze terms  “possibility” or what  we already know  can occur  based  on what  is already there.   The diagram is a topological transformation of an existing social  field,  engaging both  with  possibility and  also  with  virtual potential, a reserve of newness and  difference.  Memory is one  name  that  Deleuze gives  to such potential.
