matter” (142).   The  diagram is the  inseparability of body  and  milieu;  in  other words, we no longer  have the relation of subject and  object, but only a relation of forces,  differential intensities and  our  propensity for assemblage that  allows  for an intensive experience of an actualization and  of the virtual elements of an assemblage,  the   swarming  mass   not   individuated  but   made   visible   in   its multiple, heterogeneous compositions (cells, ant, memory, matter, movement, technology).  The “double vision”  that  Kaiser  describes is itself always a part  of what    the   movement  of   the   body    entails.      Pedestrian  produces  a   super- positionality of walkers not simply by projecting images  into  real spaces,  but  by making forces  felt in that  space  through a confounding of perceptive strategies (proprioceptive and  visual)  and  a doubling of  the  everyday via  memory, the memory of the feeling  of walking in the city as you hang  back on the edge  of the screen,   the   memory  of  a  multitude  of  viewing  positions  compressed  and overlaid,  and   the  memory  of  a  horizontal  relation  to  a  vertical   screen:   the memory of the familiar made  strange. In redeploying all of these cinematic tools, Kaiser  and  Eshkar   make  a  machine for  living  cinematically that  reroutes the mournful response to September 11, an  event  all too  often  described as “like  a film”, into the problem of how now to act and move,  the “yet to come”.
