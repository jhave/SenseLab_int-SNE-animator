3. Extend  individuation beyond being-individual. Individuation does  not  stop with  the  individual. The  error  of thinking about  individuation in general is to make  the  individual the  final  phase, which  would end  the  process of individuation. It is as if from  the  moment an  individual is formed, there  is no more   room   for  a  new   individuation  to  occur   to  it.  Rather,   individuation  is extended within and  beyond the individual. And  what  arises  from individuation is  not  a  completely autonomous  individual, which  would exclude the  nature from  whence it came  – this  preindividual nature, source  of the  possible – but  a hybrid  shape, half-individual, half-preindividual.  As  an  individual, it  is  the result  of an individuation and,  as a bearer  of preindividual dimensions; it is the actor of new individuations, of new possible actualisations of the possible. It is as if the  individual extended beyond itself  – never  in total  adequacy – towards a wider nature, more  undifferentiated than  it carries  with  it. The frontiers of the individual, which  define  its identity and  which  differentiate it from all other individuals, are fuzzier, more  dilated than  they  seem  at first sight.  There  would be  in  the  individual what  we  might  call  “fringes” which  extend it to  a larger nature and  which  participate in its identity. Simondon talks  of an  “individual- milieu”,  a   hybrid   shape,  charged  with    potentials  and    singularities.   The individual, from  an individuation of nature, seems  to finally  be no more  than  a kind  of folding, which,  unfolded, redeploys all of nature.
