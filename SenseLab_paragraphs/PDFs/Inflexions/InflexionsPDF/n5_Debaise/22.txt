opposite that  Simondon intends to highlight by distinguishing the  possible and the  actual:  if  the  possible is  what   gives  rise  to  individuation, the  individual, which  arises,  differs  from the possible which  led to its individuation. To produce or spark off does  not  mean  “contain”: the  possible does  not  contain the  already actual  before  it emerges, because every  individual is an event,  which  cannot be reduced to all the elements required by its genesis  (we shall return to this later).
