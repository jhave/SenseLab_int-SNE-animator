technical object,  the  living  or  even  physics), all true  relations being  essentially processual. It is because it has  cut  the  relation and  individuation that  modern thinking has only been able to reproduce false problems such as how individuals can  form  groups, how  subjects   can  enter   into  relations with   objects  etc.  We suppose  that   the  relation  comes   after   the  formation  of  the  terms   (subjects, individuals, objects,  groups). But  what  the  construction of the  plane  of nature allows  is for the relation prior  to the term  to be within individuation. Individuals communicate in groups because they  are all taken  in individuations, becomings. Similarly,  subjects  are  in relation to objects  because they  all tend  to something other  than  themselves, something, which  contributes to their  identity. What communicate are not subjects  between themselves, but  regimes of individuation that meet.
