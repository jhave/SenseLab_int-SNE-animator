Then:  that  the  relation  concerns a  part   of  the  individual  which   is  not  itself individual. It concerns preindividual singularities, those  charges of nature of the possible  which   all  individuals  hold   and   which   allow   them   to  extend  their individuation and  produce new  ones.  The relations between individuals rarely focus  on what  they  are but  on a space  of indeterminacy; this  zone  of preindividuations  connecting them  to a broader nature. Therefore, we  can hypothesise  that   if  preindividual  nature  precedes  all   distinctions  between domains or modes of existence,  the individual forms  itself and  extends elements which  are  at  once  physical, biological, technical and  social,  and  which  form  a milieu  within the individual itself.
