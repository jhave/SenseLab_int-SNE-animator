These  regimes of  individuation enable  the  question of  individual existence   a larger,   more  profound dimension to  which   it  participates and  from  which   it cannot be  abstracted. This  larger   plane,   necessary for  constructing a  way  of thinking  individuation  which   is  at   the   same   time,   thinking-relationally  – requiring the  two  to  identify with  one  another – Simondon calls  this “preindividual nature”.
