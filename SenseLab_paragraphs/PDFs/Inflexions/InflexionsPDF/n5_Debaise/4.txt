With   Simondon,  there   resounds,  once   again,   the   assertion:   everything  is relational. More precisely, he centres  all the exploration of nature, in its multiple aspects, with  the  fundamental principal of “being  is relation”. By drawing on a lineage   of  philosophers,  from   Leibniz   to  Whitehead  by  way   of  Tarde,   who attempted to make  the relational a transcendental or genetic  principle, he asserts that  the  question of being,  without losing  its pertinence, should be decentred in favour of the  relational. It is this  major  reversal that  we  would like  to analyse here   by  presenting  evidence of  its  effects  in  our   experience.  If  Simondon’s philosophy is to be relevant today it is because, in our view, it proposes the most contemporary  of  problems:   how   among  the   diverse  registries  such   as  the physical, the biological, the psychic  and the social do we characterize relations?
