source  of all individuation, regardless of the level of complexity, Simondon calls preindividual singularities. What  is a preindividual singularity? Any  definition is  always specific  because the  very  characteristic of  a  singularity is  that  it  is defined  only   by   its   function:   it   breaks    the   equilibrium;   [6]  it   creates    a transformation or  an  individuation. It  “may   be  the  stone  which   initiates the dune, the gravel  which  is the germ  of an island in a river carrying alluvium” (Simondon 1964: 36, translator’s translation). We could  establish in all domains the  singularities of a field  from  which  a situation becomes  unstable, transforms itself,  follows  a new  trajectory which  spreads (transductive propagation) [7] to the  entire  field.  The  characteristic of a singularity is that  we  cannot define  its effects  before  they  are  established, that  we  cannot a priori delimit the  space  in which  these  effects will operate (a technical object may  cause  a rupture in a field and  propagate something of its  operation in  other  fields).  But  these  examples have  limitations as they  return to already constituted realities, while  the  notion of  singularity  arises   on  a  “preindividual”  level;  it  is  therefore  necessary  to imagine it as short  of the  constitution of these  examples, that  is to say,  prior  to the grain  of sand,  the technical object or the  stone.  [8] Therefore, we distinguish radically the  notion of  singularity from  that  of  the  individual (which  implies identity, autonomy and  a relative invariance).
