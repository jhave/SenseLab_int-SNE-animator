We  can   stretch  this   principle,  beyond  that   of  knowledge,  to  all  forms   of participation in schemes of individuation: they imply  individuation in the assemblage of elements from  which  they  are composed. A collective  is nothing other  than  the encounter of a multiplicity of psychic,  technical and  natural individuations, which  extend and  overlap with  one  another. The  collective  is neither a superior reality  to the  individual, nor  the  foundation of all collective existence.  What  comes  first, are the schemes of individuation, which  are at once psychic  and  collective,  human and  non-human.
