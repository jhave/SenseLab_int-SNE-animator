[6] The concept of equilibrium refers  here to what  Simondon calls a “metastable” equilibrium, which  is to  say  a tense  balance,  beyond stability, held  by  a high energy potential. Without this metastable equilibrium, a singularity would never be   able   to   “break  the   balance”.  It  is  the   fragile,   unstable  character  of  a heterogeneous relation, which  gives  a singularity the possibility of transforming the equilibrium.
