Preindividual nature is to be constructed to be able to report each individuation by  linking it  and   by  giving   it  larger   dimensions. This  is  the  methodological principle of Simondon’s approach: in each situation encountered in experience, it is to invent and  to construct a plane  which  increases its dimensions and  puts  into perspective the manner in which  it is constituted and  relates  to other  elements of experience. Whatever the intended domain – physical, biological, psychological, collective  or  technical – Simondon builds a plane  (a surface),  which  he  poses prior  to  their  differentiations and  which  allows  him  to  start  with  what  relates them  before  differentiating them.  This  is the  condition so that  the  problem of individuation is not  the  simple  mirror of a thought of being-individual, that  it does not generalise characteristics.
