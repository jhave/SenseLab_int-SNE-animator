2. Consider nature as the “actually possible”, which  is to say, that  which  is likely to  create  something. By saying  that  nature is the  actually possible, Simondon intends to make  an  important distinction between the  possible and  the  actual. The possible is the preindividual singularities, which  can cause an individuation, whilst  the actual  is the individual produced by the individuation. This constraint involves a valorisation of the possible, that is to say, singularities whose  actuality is just an expression or an effect. This allows  us to clarify and  vary  our definition of  individuation:  it  is  the  passage from  nature to  the  individual, which   now means  it is the passage from the possible to the actual,  or even from singularities to individuals. Nevertheless, we must  be very  careful  about  the relationship possible/actual, as it could  suggest that  the possible already contains the actual, or even that nature includes virtually all being-individuals, and  that the latter  are merely the  realisation of  an  already given  nature. However, it  is  exactly  the
