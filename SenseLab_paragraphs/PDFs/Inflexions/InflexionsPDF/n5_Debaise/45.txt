[9] Simondon uses  this  idea  of  a praesenti to  account for  the  relations in  the present, produced simultaneously with  individuation. He writes  of concepts that they  are “neither a priori nor a posteriori but a praesenti, as there  is an informative and  interactive communication between that  which  is greater than  the individual and  that which  is smaller than  it” (Simondon 2007: 66, translator’s translation).
