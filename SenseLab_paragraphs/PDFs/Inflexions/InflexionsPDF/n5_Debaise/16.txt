Simondon retains from  physis only  its requirement: to place  oneself  at a level  of reality  prior  to that  of things and  individuals, the  source  of their  creation. We would say  that  the  individual comes  from  nature or  rather is part  of  nature. Nature is not all things that exist, but the principle of their  existence,  the “transcendental” of all individual existence.  However what  strikes  us as fundamental,  is  precisely  the  difference  that   Simondon  notes   in  relation  to thinking the  physis in a way  that  could  be called  “romantic”. For him,  and  it is this that  particularly interests us, preindividual nature is not something that  we should return to, to which  we should strive  to be the most adequate possible, it is not the basis of all the elements of our experience, a sort of standard or a selective principal; it is a pure  construction.
