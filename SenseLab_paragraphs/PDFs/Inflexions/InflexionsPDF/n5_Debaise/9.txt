If we  wish  to rid  ourselves of this  abstraction, it is then  necessary to switch  to another plane,  to pose  the questions – whatever their  field – at another level. In Bergsonian  terms,   we  would  say  that   we  must   move   from   an  exclusively “reality-made” approach, to  a general approach of “reality as  becoming”. The problem  must    be   re-posed  at   the   level   of   the   assemblage  of   processes, fabrications, the emergence of realities that we experience, that is to say, we must move  from the “being-individual” to individuation.
