Meanwhile Iâ€™m sucking stones,  begging some marrow from the bones  of the decimated. And  where does  this  leave  you?  To what  end  do  we  feel guilt,  or relief or sorrow? Remorse or anger  or vengeance or pity?  To what  end?  It is all doing  and  doing  and  done.  Do. Move. Forward or back and  inward and  out and thoughtful and thoughtless. Just move. Start the path  and it will appear.
