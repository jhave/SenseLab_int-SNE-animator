Only  the  history remains. Some  carry  it  as  saviors,   some  as  victors,  some  as slaves.  And  yet  we’re  still  here,  those  of  us  who  are  still  here,  and  if every generation  more   disappear  then   every   generation  has   a   memory  of   the disappeared and  if ever the disappearances end, then there  will be an end to disappearances. It never  ends  it can end  it won’t  end  it does  end.  Start  the path and it will appear.
