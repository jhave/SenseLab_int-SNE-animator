[3] Each Methodology has its own  life history. It starts  as a dodge facilitating the accomplishment of some  nascent urge  of life.  In  its  prime, it represents some wide  coordination of thought and  action  whereby this  urge  expresses itself as a major  satisfaction of existence.  Finally,  it enters  upon the lassitude of old age, its second childhood. The larger  contrasts attainable within the scope of the method have  been  explored and  familiarized. The satisfaction from  repetition has  faded away.  Life then  faces  the  last  alternatives in which  its fate  depends [....] When any methodology of life has exhausted the novelties within its scope  and  played upon them  up  to the incoming of fatigue, one final decision determines the fate of the species.  It can stabilize itself, and  relapse so as to live; or it can shake  itself free, and enter  upon the adventure of living better  (Whitehead 1929: 18-19).
