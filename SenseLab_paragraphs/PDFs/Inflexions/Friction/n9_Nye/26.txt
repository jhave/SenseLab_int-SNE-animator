[6] In  Samuel  L. Delany’s  Dhalgren, the  aspiration-less drifters in  the  fictional, post-apocalyptic American city  of Bellona  are  startled one  evening to find  that there  are not one, but two moons hanging largely  in the sky. Two moons become a signifier  for  a landscape in  flux,  vibration, motion. The  narrative of the  text functions as a möbius strip,  the “beginning” of the text folding into its “end”, the landscape reconstituting itself (but different) as a locale unfixed in normative functionings of time and  space.  Most of the characters in this narrative are black, queer,  female,  or immigrants to this city out of time. A möbius strip,  of course,  is a ribbon  riddled with  improbability, its facets only ever virtual. Wildness knows no bounds.
