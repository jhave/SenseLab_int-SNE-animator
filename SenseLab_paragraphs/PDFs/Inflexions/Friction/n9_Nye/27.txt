[7] In the crystalline, you can never  see all images  at once. “Crystalline narration will   fracture  the   complementarity  of  lived   hodological  and   a  represented Euclidean  space.   Having  lost  its  sensory-motor  connections,  concrete   space ceases   to   be   organized  according  to   tensions  and   resolutions  to   tension, according to goals,  obstacles, means  or even  detours.” How  would a landscape versed  only   in  the  crystalline  perform?  What   fugitivities would  it  support, wildness would it let in? How  might  it fold back on itself, in clever concealment? (Deleuze 2005: 128)
