Continuing:  A number (x) of these  strings quietly present themselves, nearing the foreground of your  attention. [2] Coming from somewhere off in the distance to  your  left  and  disappearing somewhere over  to  your  right,  they  maintain a directional tendency but  retain  an  independence from  each  other;  these  string- things are following the  course  of their  string-ness from  and  into  imperceptible depths. There  is no  sound here,  but  the  space  resembles an  aural  field,  full  of reverberation, events  far out of sight creating vibrations in the lattice of your immediate surrounds.
