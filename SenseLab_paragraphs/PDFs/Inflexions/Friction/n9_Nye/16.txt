On a plane  adjacent to these two moons, other  ribbon-surfaces depict landscapes. These  landscapes are  larger  than  a single  plane  might  hold,  but  many  ribbons folding in on themselves, creating structures of dodge and  weave  start  to do the work  of holding it  aloft.  Each  landscape is not  contained on  one  surface,  but pours over the fold, continuing out of sight, to the interior or the opposite side of its  crystalline form.  [7] Borders  lose  their  cohesion. A single  face of landscape belies  but  does  not  hold  its entirety. Imagined continuity takes  the  place  of the whole,   the   virtual  supplanting  the   real,  while   the   real   is  tucked  away   for safekeeping. A landscape can now  be carried in the mindâ€™s eye. A border can be traversed from the centre,  meaning made  by the juxtaposition of one moon  to the next, one homeland to another. A homeland, its scale hidden by the deceptively simple  operation of tucking the  real  into  the  virtual, carried on a fold  no larger than  a postage stamp. Tucked  into the cuff of your  pants for safekeeping.
