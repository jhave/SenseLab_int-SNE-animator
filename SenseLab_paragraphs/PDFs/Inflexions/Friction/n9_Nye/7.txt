These   strings  are   not   still.  They   don’t   perceptively  move,   but   on  singular occasions their  trajectories shift,  to align,  caress,  run  abreast of each  other,  in a choreography of being both together and  separate. Had  these strings not selected themselves out,  you  would not  have  noted their  gambol—their here  and  there, the resonance of their  fluctuation between concrescence and  form-taking. After a moment, they separate—split – fray – bound off in unknowable directions. “You” reconstitutes itself again  for its next sojourn.
