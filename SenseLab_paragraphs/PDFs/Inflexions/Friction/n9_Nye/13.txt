Return to this spiderâ€™s web of cotton  lines zipping to and  fro, and  substitute with ribbons  careening  this  way   and   that,   ripping  past   one  another, turning  on themselves into complex crystalline forms,  presenting fragments of truth and untruth. Ribbons  fold  in on  themselves like origami, creating faces adjoined  to faces  in both  space  and  time.  The  perspectival force  of progression has  folded itself into an unknowable knot.
