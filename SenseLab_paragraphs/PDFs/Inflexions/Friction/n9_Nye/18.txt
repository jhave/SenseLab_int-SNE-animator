[1] On a different life-plane as a becoming-architect, I was  tasked with  the same initiation of many  in the field: learn the daunting, seemingly impenetrable task of mastering AutoCAD. As with  other  vector-based software, all points in its virtual reality  are relative:  placing your  cursor in the softwareâ€™s black void  is imprecise, its  confluence of  x,  y  and  z  vectors   difficult   to  locate,  let  alone  conceive   of. Adjusting to this reality  is like learning to trust  the placement of you  foot in the next step in a pitch black room; time, and an awareness that the distance between points is a leap of faith towards the speculative and conceptual.
