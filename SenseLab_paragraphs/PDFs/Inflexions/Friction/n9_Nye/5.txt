You  are  within this  uncountable number of  strings, lacking  coordinates. But, “you”  are a(n impossibly) suspended “you,” an invisible “you,” a “you”  without agency.  You are a vector,  a “you”  of convenience, set to expire  the instant “you” is/are no longer  required. Don’t  worry;  “you”  will continue to be reconstituted with  new  qualifications for  some  time,  iterations echoing  forward and  behind, the terminus of this journey of you-ness only known by the stillness of its arrival. The end of the line. [1]
