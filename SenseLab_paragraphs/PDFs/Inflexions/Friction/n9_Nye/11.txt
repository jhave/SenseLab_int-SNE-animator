Instead, imagine a ribbon  that has more than  two planes. It maintains its thin and thick, its coming-to and going-away. But it also adds the capacity to carry, to turn sideways and  hide,  to catch, present a face, to slice. A ribbon  offers an affordance of rest, layer, and surface.  Imagine this ribbon  has the capacity to be as wide  or as invisible as its evasion of capture requires, carrying imaginary homelands across linear  perimeters of time and space. Side-step the line.
