Slow  the  moment down. Pause.  Feel the  line  slack,  cut; let out  the  line,  line  by line,  remember that  these  cotton  lines  with  their  sumptuous tactility  are  just  a proposition that   you  have   been  entangled by,  a  wild   nest  that   ‘you’  is/are trapped within, iteration upon iteration of the illusion of choice, a becoming anything-but-other. Imagine that  gorgeous, dandelion-like nest  of lines  of unrealized and  realized potentials, and  recall: in the network-making, border- linking,  searching for-  of family  resemblances, these  logical  connections which are so highly  prized are the trip-line of something else.
