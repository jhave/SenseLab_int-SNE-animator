It  is  not  possible to  see  all  facets  of  a  ribbon   at  once.  Invariably, one  side  is hiding. One  side  of a ribbon  may  display an  effect, where the  other  contains a cause.    Logic   is   hidden,   unavailable  for   inspection.  Progression  loses   its coherency, its narrative disjunctive, misaligned.
