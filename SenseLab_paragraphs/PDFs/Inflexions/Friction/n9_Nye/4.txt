Picture  an uncountable number of strings in space: cotton,  unbleached, soft to the touch   and  casually fuzzed, in  the  way  that  only  natural fibres  can  be.  Taut: coming  from  and  receding to distances beyond your  field of vision.  The strings, shooting in  every  possible direction, create  a delicate network that,  were  it to have  edges,  might  resemble the  hazy  blowball of a dandelion in bloom.  These strings, their  networked connections, the  structure that  they  compose have  no knowable  borders,  for  their   plane   of  experience bounds  outwards  with   an appetite that exceeds  timeâ€™s will to march  forward.
