[4] How  to do Research-Creation? At the SenseLab,  our  research location  resides in the hyphen; but that  hyphen represents a territory in and of itself, an important locality   underexplored  by   current  thinking  on   the   subject.   Sawchuk  and Chapman  start   in  this   direction  with   their   research  category  “Creation-as- Research”, hinting at its radical potential to upend knowledge production - “It is in  this  sense  that  such  creative work  can  be  understood as  a  strong form  of intervention, contributing to knowledge in a profoundly different way  from  the academic norm.” But  why  do  we  shy  away  from  a total  radicalization of this form  of knowledge production, buffering this  hybridity by mimicking creation- as-research work  within more  established “theoretical articulations? (Sawchuck and Chapman: 2012)
