Nature is not  mute.  It is eloquent:  discursively structured and therefore meaningful throughout, saturated with  messages and stories,  and  without any  stuff  (energy), so far as we  shall  ever know,   that  is  unpatterned - all  of  which   includes, but  vastly exceeds,  both  us  and  our  language, the  latter  itself  a subset  of our own discursivity. (Curry 2008: 59)
