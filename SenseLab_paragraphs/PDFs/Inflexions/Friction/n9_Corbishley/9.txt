In January 2011, I drove Mildred, an elderly local, around the Valley (she was ninety so too old to walk up and  down the Valley). At one point  she asked  me to stop  next to the flat park  which  is the top of the landfill  and  said, “A creek used   to  be  under  there” (Pfeffer,  personal  communication, November 20,
2010). But no visible  trace  could  be seen.  I had  never  considered that  a creek existed  at the bottom of this deep  valley.  It was  as if the filling and  flattening of the valley obliterated all potential thoughts about  the creek itself.
