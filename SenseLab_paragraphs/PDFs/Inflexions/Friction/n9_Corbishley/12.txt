When   we  locals  drew a  life  size  map   of  the  creek  on  the  surface   of  the park/landfill (above  where it  lies  inside   a  pipe  now)  in  February 2012 it slowly  awakened a deep  keening; a strange new  but also old feeling  emerged of a collective  wanting to cradle  the creek in our  arms  and  gently  lift it to the surface.  A “call to arms” coming  from the creek itself.  It was as if, in the space between one moment and  the next, something was born; rhizomatic thoughts and  feelings  emerged and  transversally connected with  others' thoughts and feelings  via some  kind  of unexpressed acknowledgement of a deeper keening about  loss. Until then,  no one had  thought about  the creek or even cared.  The life-size drawing of the creek traced  on the surface  of the ground was in some ways  a map  because it was representative of a pre-existing creek, but in other ways  it was  a diagram because it summoned forth  new  kinds  of spaces  filled with a new audience, and a community yet to come.
