The creation of conditions for a minor to emerge resides between humans and rocks, the young tree and  the chickens  - the internal variability created in the relational in-between. This variability is an on-going process  of aesthetic co- composition.   Necessitating more  than  just  human participation, requiring instead the  collective  expression of  intensities generated  by  corporeal and non-corporeal  things.  In   conversation  with   Andrew  Murphie,  he   said, “everyone has  a  lost  creek.  The  experience of  a  creek  being  buried under rubbish or concrete” (2015). In order to break  through the “rubbish/concrete,” it seems  that  all we need  to do, is to generate minor conditions. One way  we do  this  is by engaging in collective  speculation and  generating propositions about  the creek. From  time  to time  during these  encounters it feels as though the creek makes  itself felt collectively, through, between and around us. When this occurs  a threshold is crossed, and  a new type of space appears and  with  it a new type of relation to both the creek and each other.
