A process  in time,  whereby innumerable particular terms  lapse and   are   superseded  by   others   that   follow   upon  them   by transitions which,  whether disjunctive or conjunctive in content, are themselves experiences, and  must  in general be accounted at least as real as the terms  which  they relate. (James 1912: 57)
