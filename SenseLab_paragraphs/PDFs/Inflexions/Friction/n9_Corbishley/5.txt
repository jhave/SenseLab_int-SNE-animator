In  the   1940s,  the   Wellington  City   Council   decided  to   create   a  landfill (domestic and  industrial rubbish dump)  in  the  Valley.  [1]  The  creek  was piped and  buried beneath five  to  thirty   meters of  domestic and  industrial waste.  There,  inside  the  pipe,  it has  continued to flow  for sixty  or so years,
long enough to be forgotten except by a few elderly people.
