That has not happened as such.  Deploying such  a method seems  to have  had no  effect,  as  the  creek  itself  has  not  physically changed. It  remains buried beneath the landfill.  After some  time, however, the humans have  experienced an   intensive  transformation  instead,  noticing  that   they   are   collectively becoming  creek.   It   is   their   extensive  separation   from   the   creek,   their constitution as  separated forms  and  matters, that  is coming  undone in  this becoming: “[A]ll  forms  come  undone, as do  all the  significations, signifiers, and  signifieds, to the benefit  of an unformed matter of deterritorialized flux, of nonsignifying signs”  (Deleuze and  Guattari 1986: 13). This transformation - from expecting the creek to raise itself up to us to a becoming creek - presents an  affective   opening  up  of  a  new   possibility,  new   space   and   movement between human and  creek,  summoning forth  becomings of molecular intensities. Becoming  is an affectual  process  that  unfolds as a feeling, thinking and    doing    process.    Locals   have    entered   into    an   emergent   affectual relationship  with   the   creek   that   is  felt.  It  is  not   an   equal   or   unequal relationship, but an unfolding intensity (rather than  extensivity or territory) of the senses and of thinking. [3]
