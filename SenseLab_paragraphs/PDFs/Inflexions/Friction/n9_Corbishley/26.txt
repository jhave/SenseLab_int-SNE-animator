One  cannot  be really  sure  of anything, even  that  the  process  of becoming is occurring explicitly,  or if one is the only  person experiencing it. But a contemporary  anxiety   we  have   acquired  to  always  dissect,   separate and isolate  has  been  disturbed by a constancy that  is the  subtle  humming of the collective   feeling/doing  process   of  becoming.  Among  locals   there   is  an insistent  sense   of  process,   of  something  going   on:  an  always  in  motion, meandering (nomadic) movement, flowing where the land  will let it, pushed by   the   downward  force   of   its   own   unfolding.  This   movement  is   an unstoppable downward streaming, pooling, swirling, gurgling, murmuring. It is experienced across  all the projects  and  potential encounters that  occur  and are spoken about  in meetings and in daily conversation. [7]
