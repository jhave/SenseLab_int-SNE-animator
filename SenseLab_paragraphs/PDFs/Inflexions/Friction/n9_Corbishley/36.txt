Such  a  blanket does  not  “represent;” instead it  is  a  virtual composite that arrays a complex combination of things, prehending the  next  instance from the  imperceptible to  the  felt.  The  open-ended woven nature of the  blanket fosters  endless chains  of possibility that  provides a framework for becoming - without beginning or end,  limit  or single  meaning. It opens  individuated singularities up  to  a host  of new  and  alternative possibilities out  of which emerge, and  re-emerge, de-subjectified entities.  These are beyond verbal expression. They are instead sensed, felt, and  are a presence that is constant. It will be there  long after  us. The aim, therefore, is to make  the sensory blanket “real”  or rather to actualize it, and  then  we will be able to pass  the care of it on so that  humans, the creek – all beings  – will continue to co-habit  the Valley of the Wild in entanglements acting on entanglements, fold upon fold.
