A fibre  stretches from  a human to an animal, from  a human or an animal to molecules, from molecules to particles, and so on to the imperceptible. Every  fibre is a universe fibre. A fibre strung across   border  lines  constitutes  a  line  of  flight   or  of deterritorialization. (Deleuze and Guattari 1988: 249)
