We are becoming creek.   We are becoming the this-ness and  the thing-ness of the  Valley  of the  Wild.  We are  in the  middle of a collective  adventure. This has been an imagining of all forms  of individuation as processes of becoming. All  corporeal and  non-corporeal entities   and  the  deterritorialized territory within the Valley of the Wild—these operate together as generators of evental minor conditions so that  we  can  deploy durational practices, as a means  of engaging urgent ecological  issues  across  the  three  registers of environment, sociality  and  subjectivity. The collectively felt presence of evental minor conditions generates a collective  feeling  of hope  and  both  a caring  for, being cared  for, and  a being  interwoven and  connected together within the  virtual wefts  and  weaves of  what   locals  have  termed a  warm and  soft  “sensory blanket.”
