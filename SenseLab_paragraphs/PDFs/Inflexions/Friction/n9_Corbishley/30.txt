We have  been  mourning the  loss of our  creek,  but  recently it revealed to us that  there  is no point  to this,  as it was  never  lost  (itâ€™s just  having a difficult time). So instead of mourning, we choose  to adorn the creek, celebrate its aliveness, to  bring  it  alive  in  the  minds of locals.  On  January 22nd,  locals performed a celebration that  bought the creek  and  bodies  in close proximity. Using  our  bodies  we mapped the creek on top of the landfill,  playing a game in order to add  flow  of the  creek  towards the  sea,  and  leaving an  affective trace long after the ripple of bodies  is gone.
