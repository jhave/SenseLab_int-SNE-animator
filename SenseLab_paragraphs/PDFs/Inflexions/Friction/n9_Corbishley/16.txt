New    space,    where  human/non-human   encounters  intensify,  becomes possible when things are slowed down by listening, noticing and  expressing actions  that  would potentiate a speaking back process  for both  corporeal and incorporeal things. Slow  thoughts are  acknowledged as “[B]ecoming part  of the  collective  adventure” (Stengers 2002: 252-253). [4] We locals  have understood  that   when  things  slow   down  to  a  certain   point   a  rhythmic interplay emerges (similar  to a vibration) where amplification of the  sensed but  unheard or unseen—for example, the trickle  of the creek  itself—becomes audible differently. This  audibility no  longer  occurs  in  the  creek  or  in  the locals’  ears  but  rather across   creek  and   humans and   their   criss-crossings within moments that,  slowed down, are stretched to reveal  new  space  in the gaps.
