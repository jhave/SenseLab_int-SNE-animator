These  “slow-down” techniques have  disrupted locals'  individual experiences of the  Valley  by opening up  fields  of collective  attunements of an emerging affectual    ecology;   what    Deleuze  and   Guattari  call   “material-forces”  as opposed to “matter-form” (Deleuze and  Guattari 1987: 95). Examples are: walking the bush  tracks that criss-cross the valleys; grazing knuckles on rocks; tripping over tree roots and  sliding down steep  paths;  being head-butted by a low  branch;  scraping/patting and  digging in the  community garden; tasting the  food  grown by  our  own   hands;  carrying  chooks   back  to  their   coop; slowing down to listen  to the  nightly calling  of the  Ruru  as a sentinel, as a reterritorializing refrain.  [5][6] All these create a sense of place, operate to neutralize   the    habits    of   representation,   and    reposition   the    collective subjectivity of locals. Patrick  Curry writes:
