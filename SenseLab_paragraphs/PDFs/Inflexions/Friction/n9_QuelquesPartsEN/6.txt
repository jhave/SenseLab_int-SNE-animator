With  this  denial of  the  political   reality,   Philippe  Couillard, the  leader of Quebec’s government, tried  to neutralize the spring 2015 student strike’s territory of struggle: modes of existence.  He attempts to dissolve the frontline—or at least shift it towards the economical field—and denies  the properly ethical character of the conflict. If by directly attacking austerity, as a way   of  living   and   relating  to  the   world,  the   2015  struggle  was   in  fact addressing  “figments  of  the   imagination,”  hallucinations,  or   evanescent sparks, perhaps that  is due  to the  movement’s  visionary quality. It enacted other   ways   of  perceiving  the   horizon  of  potential  worlds  to  come.   The glimmering spark  we see far away  in the night  may actually be quite  close.
