What  is needed for contesting austerity plans  is a different idea of life, which  consists  for example in sharing rather than economizing, conversing rather than  not saying  a word, fighting rather than  suffering, celebrating our  victories rather than disallowing them,  engaging rather than  keeping one’s distance. […]  A  political   affirmation.  On  one  hand, it  brings   out   the visible contours of what  one is fighting for and  what  against;  on the  other,  it opens  one  up  to a calm  discovery of the  thousand other  ways the ‘’good life’’ can be understood.
