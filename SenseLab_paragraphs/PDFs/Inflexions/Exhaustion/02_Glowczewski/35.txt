Later,  Deleuze cited  my book  Du rêve à la loi chez les Aborigènes (From  Dream to Law Among Aboriginal people) with regards to the cartographic relation between the imaginary and the real: “This is why the imaginary and the real must be, rather, like two juxtaposable or superimposable parts  of a single trajectory, two faces that ceaselessly interchange with  one  another. Thus  the  Australian Aboriginals link nomadic itineraries to dream voyages, which  together compose ‘an interstitching of routes,’  in an immense cut-out [découpe] of space  and  time  that  must  be read like a map” (Deleuze 1997: 63). From the perspective of transversal assemblages of singularities, the Aboriginal approach to reticular thinking allowed me to explore their  multiple relations to space  and  time  as a cosmopolitics, in  the  sense  that Isabelle   Stengers  defines  the  term   (Stengers  2005).  Contrary  to  the cosmopolitanism promoted by Bernard Henry Lévy  and  Guy  Scarpetta in 1981 who  went  to war  against all claims  for identity or territory [5], for Stengers, the notion of the cosmopolitical is inspired as much  by her critique of scientific disenchantment, as by the emergence of new alliances, such as those forged between the  ecofeminists and  the  movement of  Wiccan  witches, who  have  revived an interest in the  reenchantment of a political  world equally anchored in the  body, mind and  flesh, as well  as in mineral, vegetal  and  atmospheric matter (Stengers
2011).
