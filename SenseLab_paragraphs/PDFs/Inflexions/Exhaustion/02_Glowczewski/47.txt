At the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues held in New York during May 2016, along  with  the rest of the audience, I took part  in the Pachamama ceremony that opened a session  on the condition of Indigenous women that  was  followed by a number of declarations and  recommendations to states,  including a letter  from Ecuadorian women  to  China,   denouncing  its  destruction  of  their   lands   and livelihood by  oil,  gas  and  large  hydraulic dam  projects.  Here  again,  the  local approach of a community from Ecuador, that  addresses itself to the Chinese state and  a transnational company, echoes  the  problems faced  by the  Aboriginals of Australia, particularly those  from  the northwest of Kimberly where the Chinese have  bought land  and  become  the  largest  landowner in  Australia in  order to undertake a massive shale gas fracking project. As has now been revealed, not only have the two companies corrupted some Australian political  representatives with astronomical sums of money, but the continent that partly depends on this regionâ€™s water is under the threat of a complete drought (Cole 2016).
