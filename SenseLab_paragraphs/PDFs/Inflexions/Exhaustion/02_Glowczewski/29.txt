When  I wrote this  in 1984, Félix Guattari suggested that  I read  Vico, Whitehead and  Simondon, and  to use the notion of “singularity” to translate the Aboriginal understanding of energy as “image-forces” that  actualize and  re-virtualize themselves through ritual  in  order to  distinguish this  from  the  non-renewable energies produced by humans.
