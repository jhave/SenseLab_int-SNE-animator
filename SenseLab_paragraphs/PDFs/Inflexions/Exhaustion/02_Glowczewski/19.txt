I speak  of Totemic Becomings and  the Cosmopolitics of the Dreaming (Glowczewski
2016). Every  man  or woman is the guardian of a constellation of Dreamings for which he or she has the responsibility of regularly celebrating rituals which consist of mapping the  sites  and  itineraries of each  Dreaming through body  paintings, songs and dances; a responsibility which stems from each person being recognized as a mutable manifestation of a given Dreaming which corresponds to them,  either by his or her own design (as revealed in a dream), by inheritance from the family group, or through alliances  created over the course  of their life.
