When the archaeologist muses about  a time when humans still lived  on earth,  “Certain groups of humans could  be seen  as totemistic … for them,  if they  had  the same physiological mechanisms as their  totems, which  only  seems  rational, they  may have  thought they  also shared a sense  of self-awareness with  the totem  animal,” his Biocom replies  by asking,  “Am  I your  totem?” (Bonnefoy  2010: 456). In this universe, in which  polymorphous biomachines reflect  on their  own  subjectivity, the humans who discover the ontologies of days gone by begin to test—in  cults— their understanding of naturalism, totemism, analogism and animism’s past definitions.
