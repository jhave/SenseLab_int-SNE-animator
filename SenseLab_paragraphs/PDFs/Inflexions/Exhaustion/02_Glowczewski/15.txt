the destruction of living environments, especially due to extractive industries that precipitate climate  change and  pollute the air and  water, are looking  for alliances and sources of inspiration among peoples, such as Amerindians, that have a vision of the Earth  different from one which  denies  Nature under the pretext that  it has surrendered to human technologies. Looked  at in this way,  I believe  that  certain hybrid movements are currently reinventing at least one new form of ontology.
