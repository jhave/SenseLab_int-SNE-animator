insult—who  intervenes  against  racism   and   injustice   (see  “The   Rise  of  the Aboriginal Superhero”). The invention of worlds proposed by superheros participates in the production of new  myths whose  wide  visibility gives rise to a new “cultural patrimony”; an SF interactive imaginary with  a real role for youth, that   also  produces  new   forms   of  subjectification  reinforced  by  the  way   the audience comments on all of this and actualises it in their lives using  social media. For instance, JK Rowling, the author of Harry Potter  is currently being  criticized on Twitter for supporting Donald Trump’s rhetoric on free speech,  and  has also come  under recent  scrutiny from  Native Americans for the  way  she  uses  their mythology in her latest book and film.
