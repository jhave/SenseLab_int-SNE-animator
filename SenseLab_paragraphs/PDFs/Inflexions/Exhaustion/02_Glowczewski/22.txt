This kind of interconnection between sacred sites and vital forces can also be found in  the  Xapiriâ€™s  spiderweb  of  shamanic  spirit   paths  which,   according  to  the wonderful account by Yanomami Davi Kopenawa, traverse the Amzonian forest like a network that  is invisible  to the naked eye but sparkles like a crystal  for the shamans (Davi  Kopenawa and  Albert  2013; see  also  Viveiros  de  Castro  2007). There  are  as  many   Xapiri  paths as  there   are  birds,   plants or  other   forms  of biodiversity. So for Indigenous people and  numerous other  alarmed voices,  the streets  and  great  dams  which  redirect rivers  risk the destruction of the multiple paths that  link all living  forms.  Stripped of its biodiversity, the forest has already been   partially  transformed  into   savannahs  or   deserts  where  human  and nonhuman inhabitants of these  lands  suffer,  increasingly due  to the pollution of local waters with  mercury (used  in gold  mining) and  other  contaminants such  as oil. Scientists,  for their part, have been able to demonstrate that the disappearance of oxygen  due  to the local destruction of the forest  severely threatens the rest of our environments across the planet (Werf, G. R. van der, et al. 2009).
