path  for hundreds of kilometres. [10] Scientists  needed time  to understand the wisdom of this ancient practice that today is encouraged by all of the natural parks that hire Aboriginal men and women for their knowledge. The strategy has proven itself to be an impressive way to cut carbon  emissions which  are exceedingly high in Australia due  to—amongst other  reasons—fires that  ravage the continent each year.  It is promoted as a model  that  can be exported and  it qualifies for what  is called REDD+ (Reducing emissions from deforestation and  forest degradation), a form of monetary compensation for carbon  emission reducers, in this case Aboriginals represented  by  the  KLC  (Kimberly Land  Council),   but  also  their sponsor, Shell, which  thus  appears to be cleared of the  emissions caused by its extractive activities.
