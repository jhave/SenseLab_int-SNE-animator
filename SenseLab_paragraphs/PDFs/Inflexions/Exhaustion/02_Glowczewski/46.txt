the UN, but  as tools that  traverse the daily  lives of all of the Earth’s  actors.  This impact of the large  scale recosmopoliticization of ancient and  local cosmological concepts stimulates the virtuality of new subjectivities and ontologies that function differently depending on the circumstances. In addition to its spiritual sense,  for some, the Pachamama ceremony for Mother Earth  or Mother Nature is a political protocol comparable to the Maori haka danced by New Zealand’s sports teams (or the mao’hi from French Polynesia, executed by various overseas bodies  during the Bastille  Day  parade in 2011) or  the  national anthems that  reference the  God  of Christianity even when one part  of the country’s population is not Christian. But in contrast to national, and  even nationalist rituals, the Pachamana ceremony is a transnational proposition that  extends the  recognition of the  living  above  and beyond the human.
