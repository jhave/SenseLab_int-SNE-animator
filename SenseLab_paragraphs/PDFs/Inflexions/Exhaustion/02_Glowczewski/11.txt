Polynesiaâ€™s description of cults  seems  to be partly inspired by current New  Age movements which  draw on various Amerindian and Celtic rituals, as well as other pre-Christian   practices,  which    some   of   the   practitioners  then   recreate  as pantheistic or Neopagan in order to revalourize the Earth.  The inventive reinterpretation of all these  rituals is often political, as is evidenced by the yearly May  Day  Parade in Minneapolis which  celebrates the  old  rural  tradition of the Maypole dance  as much  as the  working-class struggle (see Linebaugh 2016 and Sheehy  1999: 79-89).
