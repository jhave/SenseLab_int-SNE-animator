During the  COP  21 (2015 United Nations Climate  Change Conference), diverse official and unofficial meetings discussed the ambiguity of REDD+ and the trap of “commodifying” nature. Certain communities don’t  have  any  choice but  to participate in the REDD+ programs that  at least allows  them  to stay in the forest in a process  of permanently negotiating with  the resource extraction companies. But Indigenous peoples are increasingly looking  to replace  these accords  with collective   land-based programs  that   inherently  oppose  extractivist industries, from  fossil  fuels  to  renewable  energies,  as  well  as  large   scale  dams,   falsely presented by some as a “clean”  solution even though they destroy the ecosystems by diverting the river  networks that  maintain the forest’s biodiversity. As the Alliance  of Mother Nature’s Guardians underline in their  text, if the Indigenous peoples are  the  guardians of  the  forest,  rivers  and  roots,  their  ethnocide also constitutes an act of “ecocide” (Alliance  des Gardiens de Mère Nature 2015: 163). [12] Through these sorts of transplanetary meetings, new awarenesses are formed and  new alliances  forged.  That is not to say that all differences are flattened in an ecumenical mould. In fact, the different Indigenous speakers at the UN insist  on their  respective singularities but allow themselves to compare their  respective practices to build bridges and find common solutions to issues that affect the entire planet, and call us to change our economy and lifestyles.
