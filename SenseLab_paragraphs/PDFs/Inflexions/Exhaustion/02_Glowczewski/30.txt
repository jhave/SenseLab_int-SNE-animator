The  generalized interconnectivity and  transversality of human and  nonhuman, animal and  machinic subjectivities that  Deleuze and  Guattari theorized in their writings is today—it seems  to me—sometimes misunderstood by those  who  use them to support transhumanism and those who cite them all the while reproaching Deleuze and Guattari for legitimizing a “geo-engineering” that aims to modify the climate  rather than  change our  modes of existence  in relation to the  milieu.  Of course,  we do not know  what  they would say with regards to the evolution of the world since the 1990s. But I do not think  that Deleuze and Guattari would support absurd geo-engineering projects  since  these  projects  fundamentally fall outside what  they valued and defended most: the responsible and ethical influence of the micropolitical on  the  macropolitical, creative of dissensus. [4] Evidence of this, amongst others,   is  the  particular interest that  Félix  Guattari expressed in  the Walpiri people’s  relationship to dreams when he read  my  thesis  in 1983, which nourished his  cartography of  four  semiotic  types  in  mutual tension with  one another.
