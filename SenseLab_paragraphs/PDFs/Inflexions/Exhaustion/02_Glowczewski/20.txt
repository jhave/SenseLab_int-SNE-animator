In light of this, the tragedy that constitutes the destruction of a sacred  site does not only result  from the fact that a totemic  site is “an ontological incubator, i.e. the site where the identity of the members of a collective  is formed in very concrete  ways, the  common root  for a group of humans and  nonhumans” (Descola  2014: 328). Each of these sites negotiates virtual relations with  other  sites (other  humans and other  beings).  To destroy a site associated with  any given totem  amounts to endangering other  sites  and  their  guardians: all those  who  are connected to the same  “line”  of Dreaming, the Songline  that  links  hundreds of sites  spanning an ancestral totemic  people, and  all the sites belonging to other  totemic  lines which intersect the path  of the endangered site. I have  said elsewhere that  access to the spacetime  of  Dreaming  within  those   sites  was   “holographic”  (in  the   sense proposed by Roy Wagner): through each sacred  site one can virtually access the other    sites   (Glowczewski   1991).   This   holographic   capacity  indicates  that everything is related as in an open  mega-ecosystem or cosmosystem: everything that affects a site or one of its human or nonhuman becomings can have an impact on  all that  is living  and  the  forces  of the  universe. The  rituals celebrating the Dreamtime journeys contribute to the caretaking of sites belonging to these reticulum,  but   also  other   lifelines   that   it  encounters. To  dance   for  the  Rain Dreaming, for instance, is also to take care of animals and  plants that  are in need of rain. To sing to a plant  is to care for the animal that  feeds on this plant  and  for all the  unborn children whose  totemic  becomings will  be the  Dreaming of this plant,  or the animal which  feeds on it.
