The humans of the  Earth,  those  in power in the  21st  century, have often  been  classified  as naturalists … they  believed that  there  was continuity between all physiological processes from the most simple to the most complex…. You might  say that in our historical moment, everybody knows that  that  is not  true.  For  example, between HI (human intelligence) and  AI (artificial  intelligence), there  is no continuity of physical processes, even  if we  may  feel that  there  is continuity to techniques of reasoning or  knowledge processing…. Conversely, Earthlings often perceived the various levels of self- experience to be discontinuous. (Bonefoy 2010: 454)
