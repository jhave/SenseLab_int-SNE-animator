In this  context,  an Aboriginal auteur’s use  of the  TV series  format to develop a Cleverman superhero, who  has a white  mother and  refuses  to accept  his father’s ancestry of Aboriginal medicine men until  he finally decides to accept  the superpowers  and   become   an   avenger  of  justice   in   a  contemporary  urban landscape, reflects an ontological strategy in the ecosophic sense of Félix Guattari, in that  it is at once  aesthetically, ethically  and  politically critical  (a strategy that knots  the mental, social and  environmental ecologies,  in a milieu  that  is equally technical and  natural). If university criticism  with  respect to superhero films can exhaust or exhaust itself in academic rhetoric, just like many  films  of this  genre that  incessantly repeat stereotypes, this Aboriginal s director’s reappropriation of them  invites  us, rather, to imagine and produce new ontological alliances.
