The  political  importance of these  alternative modes of existence  to our  present ways  is confirmed by the fact that  Indigenous leaders are often threatened. What may  appear to some  to be anecdotal or exotic forms  of resistance, when put  into practice on  the  ground, become  sufficiently threatening  to  the  giants—mining companies and  other  powers—who try to get rid of these  little Davids, first with money, destruction, and  child abduction, as recently seen in Mexico, or with assassinations, like those  of the  Guarani in Brazil  or of ecological  activists,  like Berta Cáceres,  leader of the Council  of Popular and  Indigenous Organizations of Honduras   (COPINH)  (see   “Environmental  and   Indigenous  Rights   Leader Murdered in Honduras”). In conclusion, it seems vital that an ecosophic ontology reinvents itself from day to day, to support Indigenous peoples in their ontological becomings that  they  continuously redefine in synch  with  new  transnational and transdisciplinary alliances  that  resist  and  confront other  international economic and  financial alliances  that  destroy the planet and  all that  lives—and stands—on and with it.
