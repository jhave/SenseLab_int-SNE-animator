We  can  ask  ourselves if the  Aboriginal notion of  the  Dreaming, which  links society and nature by energetic self-referential feedback loops, does not offer a philosophy adapted to our epoch  in search  of theories concerning matter and  energy. The  fascination that Aboriginal people provoke (among some people) is probably part of this  intuition. We are  close  to a science  fiction  universe when we think  that  these  peoples have  survived 40,000 years  of the  Earth’s geographical transformations and  that  they  speak  today of sacred sites where we find petroleum and  uranium. Aboriginal people say that  we must  not destroy these  energies, because they  are part  of a vast  regulatory cycle  that  gives  meaning to  the  life and  death of humans. Thus it is with as much  ease as detachment (which  troubles our  evolutionary values) that  they  adopt all of the  material goods that our technological cornucopia proposes: houses, cars, and media can be used,  they say, but the most important is to keep contact  with the energies of the Earth and  the Dreaming.… In American military bases  isolated in  the  desert,  engineers  sometimes have  peculiar visions.  For example, the vision of an Aboriginal man would appear out of nowhere in the computer room, then evaporate, but not before saying  in  a cavernous voice,  that  they  must  cease  what  they  are doing  there….
