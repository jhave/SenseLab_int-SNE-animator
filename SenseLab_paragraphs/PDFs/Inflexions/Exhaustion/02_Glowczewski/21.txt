It is important to note  that  this  gigantic meshwork of Dreamlines is not  fixed. Apart from  the  “accidents” or  events  that  make  up  the  features of  a  rugged landscape, which  do need to be considered, the ways of moving through it change according  to  the  seasons  and   the  climate   which   continuously  transform  the landscape. Australian mythical stories  even  account for transformations of a geological scale: the  Fire Dreaming, for instance, refers  to the ancient volcanoes and  uranium deposits; the Kangaroo Dreaming evokes  the marsupial megafauna that  have  long  gone  extinct  on  the  continent;  while  the  Emu  Dreaming of the Northern Coast  at  the  Indian Ocean  accounts for  paw   prints  recognized by specialists as belonging to  diverse species  of dinosaurs. Today,  astrophysicists study the  so-called  mythical narratives about  meteors that  fell from  the  sky  to leave sacred craters. Similarly, all coastal groups of Aboriginals relate stories about the continent’s flooding and  the subsequent separation of approximately 4000 islands which presently surround continental Australia, a geological event that has been  dated by a team  of geologists as 7000 years  old (Gough 2015, Glowczewski and Laurens 2015).
