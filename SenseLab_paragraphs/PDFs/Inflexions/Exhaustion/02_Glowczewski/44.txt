These are the concluding words of a text written in 2004 during a hunger strike at the  United Nations by seven  Indigenous delegates—including Alexis  Tiouka,  a Kali’na activist  from French Guiana. [7] The hunger strike is yet another ecosophic type  of ontological strategy that accompanies the struggles of Indigenous people. In 2007, the  Declaration on  the  Rights  of Indigenous Peoples  was  signed by all countries except  four—Australia, the United States, New  Zealand and  Canada— who  all later  decided to support the declaration after  changes in government. In
2008, Australia and Canada held large national ceremonies to ask their Aboriginal populations to pardon the abuses they have suffered, such as the forced separation of children from  their  families.  The very  same  year  in Ecuador, then  in 2009 in Bolivia, the principle of Buen vivir (living well) was adopted into the constitutions of these  two  countries recognizing “the  rights  of nature” associated with Pachamama, the name  of an Andean goddess revered by the Amerindians of the Amazon and other  members of these countries, including Christians. Figures such as Pachamama, “by  their  political-symbolic dimension, their  hybrid position between nature  and  culture, and  their  utility   in  spreading the  revolutionary message, can be sufficiently large  to hold  various cosmologies within them.…  A prime example is how movements which  are sometimes opposed to one another, such  as urban feminism and  the trade unionism of rural  women, or Indigenous animists and  analogists, by  converging around Pachamama and  the  rights  of women, have  been  able to ally their  positions on a number of points” (Landivar and Ramillien 2015: 36).
