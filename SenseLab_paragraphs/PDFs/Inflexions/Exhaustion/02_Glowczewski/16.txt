The  accelerationist tendency  of  geoengineering, so  well  critiqued by  Frédéric Neyrat (2014 and  2016), shows  that  Western history, by way  of its colonizing development of both  peoples and  lands  rich in resources, has come to assert  that nature does  not exist any longer  for it has been “consumed” by the technological productions of culture. The Earth  is drained, exhausted, but is perhaps not done surprising us through the descendants of those  who,  colonized and  classified  at different moments in history as animists, totemists, pantheists or pagans, today attempt to resist  the technological cannibalization of nature by inviting us to see her, nature, as living in constant spiritual interaction with human beings. Even the proposition of rewilding or renaturalizing parks,  which  includes photo safaris  of “protected” animals, only  imagines an  artificialized nature. Similarly,  safaris  of human populations enclosed and  exploited on reserves are offered  in all parts  of the world and illustrate the arrogance behind a conception of nature as something to  be  mastered or  conquered (Glowczewski 2015). This  sort  of arrogance was further confirmed during the conversation between Bruno Latour (presented as a sociologist rather than  anthropologist) and  architect Rem Koolhaas at the “Nuit des Idées au quai  d’orsay” (Night  of Ideas  at Quai  d’Orsay) on January 27, 2016. The  two  interlocutors both  affirmed that  the  planet Earth  no  longer   had   an exteriority because it had  been  entirely urbanized or impacted by the conditions that  allow  for urbanization. By contrast, whether it is the multinaturalist perspectivism invoked by  Viveiros  de  Castro  with  regard to  Amerindians, the reticular cosmogeography of Australian Aboriginals with  whom I have  been working for more  than  thirty-seven years,  or those  of various shamanisms from all parts  of the  world, these  points of “seeing,” as Deligny  used  to say, and  the relation between interior and   exterior they  articulate, do  not  fall  within the
