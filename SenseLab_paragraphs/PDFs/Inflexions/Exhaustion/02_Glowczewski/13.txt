extractive industries that  threaten their  land.  Other  families  marched with  their faces and  clothes  painted brown like the earth,  green  like the forest,  blue like the sea,  pink  like  crustaceans, or  multi-coloured like  the  many   animal and  plant species  endangered by various kinds  of pollution. The parade’s placards and banners, some of which were full of humour, also invited participants to make like an animal and jump  into the procession of witches with pointed hats and brooms, slowly  advancing on stilts, scooters,  bikes, floats and  foot. The crowd was full of joy. The parade culminated with  an immense concert  on the shore  of a lake. The concert   opened with   a  tribute to  Mother Earth   led  by  ten  participants who represented the  cultural—and spiritual—diversity of Minneapolis:  a sacred  fire was  carried to a site consecrated to the four  winds before  being  thrown into the lake. Then followed a dance  of giant  puppets among which  was a Prince figure  in a purple toga and others  representing the Mississippi river and Mother Earth. The show, featuring classical, electronic and soul music, was interspersed with lectures conveying the repentance of civil society; admissions that  it had  heretofore failed to  recognize the  presence of Indigenous peoples, that  it had  abused people of colour, that it hadn’t been welcoming enough towards refugees and had not taken care of the land,  but  that  it would commit to changing things  from  that  moment on. Thousands of people with  their  children gathered together to participate in these  joyful festivities, bearing witness to a form of serene  conviviality that  went beyond mere entertainment to offer a beacon  of hope.
