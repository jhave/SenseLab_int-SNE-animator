In relation to the survival of human and  nonhuman populations, the affirmation of the interconnectivity of sites traversed by ancestral traces and  tracings that  are both material and spiritual, visible and invisible, can be found as a critical issue in all the ontologies that  Descola  distinguishes (totemic,  animist, analogist, or even naturalist). I for  one  believe  that  common practices make  it  possible to  bring certain ontological traits, traits of singularity as Guattari would say, closer together in a way that doesn’t  deny  their diversity. For instance, some groups that Descola distinguishes according to his ontological categories (Australians as totemists and Amazonians as  animists) are  less  different when   one  looks  at  their  shamanic practices. In the same way, certain  Indigenous conceptions of intersubjectivity that associate the self, others (human or not) and the environment in extended relations of aliveness create a new form of ontological “commons”: such a process  of subjectification  can  offer  a response to the  current challenges of global  climate change and  social injustice,  a posture that  is radically opposed to the one held  by those  responsible for these threats or those  who speculate on accelerationism and transhumanism (Srnicek and Williams  2013).
