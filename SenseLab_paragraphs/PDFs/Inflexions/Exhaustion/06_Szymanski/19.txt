The  shift   in  neoliberal  strategies  of  governance  from   industrial  capitalism’s emphasis on discipline towards deployment of control,  has seized  the potential of brain  plasticity. “Control society”  is the term  that  Deleuze uses to describe a new type   of  power that   emerges in  the  late  20th   Century, in  contradistinction to Europe’s “disciplinary”  and   “sovereign”  societies   that   figure   prominently  in Michel   Foucault’s  work   on  discipline  and   punishment  in  the   19th    and   18th centuries. Strategies of control  augment the state-run disciplinary institutions of confinement such as the military barracks, the classroom and the psychiatric ward by governance through more  decentralized and  corporatized means.  New  forms of  subjectivity  have  been  produced as  a  consequence of  this  shift  in  power. Whereas disciplinarity operates by molding its subjects from the outside (through confinement, repetitive drills  and  exercises  as well  as moral  strictures), control works  more  seductively to induce conformity by way of modulation from within the  subject  who  performs its own  enterprising sense  of self (by incurring debt, seeking  motivation and  conducting self-audits). Significantly for this study of plasticity and  power, Deleuze attunes to how  these  strategies of power are to be distinguished by their  tendency to either  mold  or modulate. He writes: “Confinements are moulds, different mouldings, while  controls are a modulation like a self-transmuting moulding continually changing from  one moment to the next, or like a sieve whose  mesh  varies  from one point  to another” (1995: 178). Of key  importance here  is  that   rather than   restricting  change by  confining and disciplining movements through moulds that  hold  for a set period of time  (the school day, the tour of duty, etc.), control societies work immanently to change, by directing,  inflecting and  modulating it  indefinitely—“In  control   societies  you never  finish anything,” Deleuze adds (1995: 178).
