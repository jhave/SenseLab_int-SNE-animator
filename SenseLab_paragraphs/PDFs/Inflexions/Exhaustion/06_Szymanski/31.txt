power  works    as   much    through   expressivity  as   through  repression  was speculatively glimpsed in Anti-Oedipus,  his earlier  work  with  Guattari on desire and  its machinism. In Foucault’s preface  to the  English  translation, he famously articulates this strange paradox that  repressive forces don’t stop people from expressing themselves as inherent to the  “molecular fascism”  that  Deleuze and Guattari  went   to  such   great   lengths  in  that   book  to  identify and   eradicate. Molecular fascism,  Foucault writes,  is “the  fascism  in us all, in our  heads and  in our  everyday behaviours, that  causes  us to love power, to desire  the very  thing that  dominates and  exploits  us” (Foucault 1983: xiii). The desire  for power, or for fascism,   is  always  already  productive.  Not   coincidentally,  what   one   if  the subjective formations it is productive of, is none  other  than  the individual: “The individual is the product of power” (Foucault 1983: xiv).
