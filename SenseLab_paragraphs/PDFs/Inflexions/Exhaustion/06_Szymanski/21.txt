This  modulatory  style   of  control   is  emblematic  of  what   Mark   Fisher   calls “capitalist realism,” the idea that  it may be easier to imagine the end of the world than  the  end  of capitalism. For  Fisher,  capitalist realism “entails subordinating oneself  to a reality  that  is infinitely plastic,  capable  of reconfiguring itself at any moment. […] We are presented with what  Jameson calls ‘a purely fungible present in which  space and  psyches alike can be processed and  remade at will’ ” (199). In the  control  society,  power entices  never-ending adaption to a plastic  reality  in perpetual change and  modulation, regardless of how  unconducive to wellness or how unsustainable such economic imperatives have proven to be. Faced with this neoliberal reality political  resistance cannot be content with only working towards the abolishment of confining structures and identities.
