“The pathologies of our  epoch  are effectively  no longer  the neurotic pathologies produced by the repression of the libido,  but rather the schizoid pathologies produced by  the  expressive explosion of ‘just  do  it’  ”  (189). In  “Re-Assessing Composition: 40 Years After  the  Publication of Anti-Oedipus” he reiterates this view: “Psychic  suffering does not come so much  from repression but mainly from the hyper-expressive compulsion…” (Berardi  2012: 114). The overarching concern running throughout Bifo’s recent  work  on  the  politics  of depression is neoliberalism’s ability  to promote aggressive and  exhausting competition by inducing  labourious  performances for  economic gain,  or  even  just  for  mere survival. By making this  critical  diagnosis of the contemporary situation, Bifo is prompted to call for “a new  cultural task”:  “to live the inevitable with  a relaxed soul. To call forth  a big wave  of withdrawal, of massive dissociation, of desertion from  the scene  of the economy, of nonparticipation in the fake show  of politics” (Berardi  2011a: 148).
