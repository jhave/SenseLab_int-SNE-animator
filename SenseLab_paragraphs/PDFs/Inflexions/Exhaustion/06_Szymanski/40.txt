[3] A recent  meta-analysis published in the American Psychological Association’s Psychology Bulletin shows  that  Cognitive Behaviour Therapy is proving less and less effective as a treatment for depression (Johnsen  and Friborg  2015). In the UK, more  than  a million  people have  received free CBT as part  of the  initiative that economist Richard Layard helped to push through with  the Oxford  psychologist David   Clark  (Burkeman 2016; Department of  Health 2012).  In  spite  of  these massive governmental efforts, mental illnesses  such as depression are still higher than ever in the UK (Campbell 2016). On the psychopharmaceutical side of things, the critical  literature is ever  mounting, from  within the scientific  disciplines and without. The success  rates  of antidepressants in treating depression overall  have drastically fallen off since the 1990s, a time when initial numbers had been inflated by drug companies selectively revealing their  studies to the FDA. Marcia  Angell, the former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, shares this history in “The Epidemic of Mental  Illness: Why?,” a lengthy 2011 review  of three books critical of the   psychiatric  establishment’s   reliance   on   psychotropic  medication  (Irving Kirsch’s The Emperor’s New Drugs: Exploding the Antidepressant Myth; Robert Whitaker’s Anatomy  of an Epidemic: Magic Bullets, Psychiatric Drugs, and the Astonishing  Rise of Mental  Illness in America; and  Daniel  Carlat’s  Unhinged: The Trouble With  Psychiatry—A  Doctor’s Revelations About a Profession in Crisis). Furthermore, a recent  patient-level meta-analysis has raised  doubts about  the effectiveness of SSRIs for “milder forms”  of depression (Fournier et al. 2012).
