The rise of the control  society  poses  a whole  new  set of questions about  political resistance that  were  absent  from  the  discourse of political  modernism. Neoliberalism has, at least in many “advanced capitalist” pockets, ceded to worker demands for more  free time  and  less rigid  work  structures; feminist and  queer demands for gender fluidity and  non-heteronormative relationships; and postcolonial demands for minority recognition. But at the same time that many  of the  20th  century’s desires are  seeing  themselves fulfilled,  and  stifling  old  molds have given way to some more flexible identities, schedules and borders, power has not ceded  any of its capacity to modulate modes of existence.
