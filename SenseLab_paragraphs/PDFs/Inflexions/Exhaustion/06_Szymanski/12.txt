As the shift in emphasis from the “psy” to the “neuro” continues to intensify across a broad range  of societal discourses and institutions, especially those pertaining to the management of health [8], the reductionist temptation to desubjectify the depression pandemic we are living through presents itself as strongly as ever. Take for example, the words of pioneering researcher in brain  plasticity, Michael Mezernich: “Contemporary  neuroscience is revealing, for  the  first  time  in  our history, our  true  human natures,” he  says.  “Human wisepersons and  societies have had great fun pondering about  the mysteries of the origins  of the ‘self’.… We now have first-level scientific answers to these questions. We now understand the basic processes that  underlie the genesis  of the ‘self’” (Mezernich). If the self can be reduced to primary brain  processes, then what  distinguishes a life coloured by depression from an exuberant one, a life on the verge of suicide from a life with an appetite for more?  According to this material reductionist viewpoint [9], the difference between these  two  tendencies of life lies in the  brain.  And  make  no mistake, it undoubtedly does,  but only if the brain  is granted an expanded sense that confounds its orthodox usage  in the neurosciences.
