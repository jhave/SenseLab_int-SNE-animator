Given  neoliberal power’s immanence to neuroplasticity as well as its immanence to the  dominant therapeutic methods which  justify  themselves with  recourse to the concept,  the lofty hopes  that  have  been  invested in neuroplasticity beg to be critically  tempered. Yet I would like to conclude on a pragmatic note, which  also happens to be a positive one,  and  suggest that  by reintroducing the question of subjectivity—of how  the brain  becomes  subject—into the plastic  dynamics of the event,  we may  ride  the quantum of potential that  neuroplasticity does  offer: the potential for  transversal social  practices constitutive of therapeutic activism to usher in novel  subjectivities whose  processual composition amounts to nothing less than  well-becoming—a collectively animated well-being whose  therapeutic and political  value  lies in the how of its making.
