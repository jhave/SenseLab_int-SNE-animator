The  distinction  that   Malabou  and   Jeannerod  set  up   between plasticity and flexibility  posits  plasticityâ€™s creative capacity to challenge the neoliberal demand of  interminable  flexibility.   According  to  their   formulation,  plasticity  actively shapes the  world, whereas flexibility  submits to  the  shape  that  the  world has already taken.  For  these  thinkers, the  act  of  giving   form,  creating, inventing, erasing and styling  constitute the pragmatic and experimental basis for resistance. Conversely, flexibility  would entail a subduing of this creative capacity in order to accept the form of the world as it is (in its becoming), and submit to its modulatory impositions, rather  than   contribute to  its  ongoing formation through  acts  of creation.
