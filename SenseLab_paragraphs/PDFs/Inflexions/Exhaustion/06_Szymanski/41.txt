[4] Depression recurrence statistics show  that  “50 percent of those  who  recover from a first episode of depression having one or more additional episodes in their lifetime,  and  approximately 80 percent of those  with  a history of two  episodes having another recurrence” (Burcasa  and  Iacono  2007:   960). For depression recurrence statistics, see  Burcasa  and  Iacono’s “Risk  for  Recurrence in Depression.”
