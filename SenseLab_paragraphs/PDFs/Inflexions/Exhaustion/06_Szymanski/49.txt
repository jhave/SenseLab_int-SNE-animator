[9] “The brain” is a fetish  object of bourgeois psychiatry and  the materialist- reductionist ideology that it holds dear.  Mark Fisher, author of Capitalist Realism, puts  it bluntly: “The chemico-biologization of mental illness  is of course  strictly commensurate with  its depoliticization” (Fisher  37). Materialist reductionism is a cluster   of  dominant beliefs  within  neuroscience research that   account for  all human experience and  consciousness in terms  of biological  processes, and  thus refuses  to admit either  experience or consciousness as scientifically valid  entities. For materialist reductionists, conscious experience is nothing more  than  the sum of firing  neurons. According to this widely held  scientific  worldview, experience is reducible to the brain,  and  thus  the key to understanding all psychopathology lies in unlocking the neurological mysteries of brain  functioning. It is easy to see how such a perspective is commensurate with the depoliticization of melancholia since it completely disengages the brain  from the psychosocial field of experience and  its conditioning by  power. As Jeffrey Schwartz writes  in The Mind  and the Brain: “To the mainstream materialist way  of thinking, only  the physical is real. Anything nonphysical is at best an artifact,  at worst  an illusion” (24).
