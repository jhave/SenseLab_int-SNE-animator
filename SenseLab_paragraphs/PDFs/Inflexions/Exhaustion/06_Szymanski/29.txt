The  political  directive to  withdraw is historically grounded in  the  Autonomia movement’s refusal  of work  strategy, but can be criticized as promoting a culture of  defeatism and  falsely  equating all  action,  including  activism, with unconsciously  performing  the  interests of  neoliberalism.  [11]  I  include  these extracts  here in order to show  how Malabou and  Jeannerod’s plasticity-flexibility binary that allies plasticity to creativity and flexibility to submission is troubled by the fact that  neoliberal economics depend on creativity, expressivity and  novelty in order to extract surplus value and reproduce its lecherous relationship between capital  and life. This is not to say that all actions are inherently coopted and futile, and  that  we should follow  Bifo in his most  depressive moments by withdrawing from  the  scene  of activism, but  simply to point  out  that  in the  control  society, power is savvy  enough to  encourage the  expressive, creative,  and  modulatory capacities of (neuro)plasticity, but in ways that never  risk its dominance.
