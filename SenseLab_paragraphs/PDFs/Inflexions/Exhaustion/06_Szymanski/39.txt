[2] Politicians are  increasingly making mental health a policy  priority. Take for example the UK secretary of health Jeremy  Hunt’s recent  admission that  mental health services  are the NHS’s greatest area of weakness, and his subsequent announcement of £1.4 billion  for children and  young people’s  mental health care (Campbell 2016: n.p.). In Canada, mental health funding has become  a hot-button issue  in failing  budgetary negotiations between the federal government and  the provinces, due  largely  to Federal Health Minister Jane Philpott’s insistence “that billions in new federal money be devoted specifically to mental health care” (Curry
