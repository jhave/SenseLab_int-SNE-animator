It is hard not  to see the  appeal of this  sort  of optimistic assertion that  creative actions can defy the control society’s demand of endless flexibility. Yet what  needs to be emphasized here is that even plasticity’s creative capacity cannot escape  the “plastic paradox”  outlined  above;   the  paradox  that   plasticity  can  habitually reinforce psychological suffering as much  as its therapeutic overcoming, political oppression  as      much    as   emancipation.  What   scholarship  on   the   various incarnations of the  control  society  points to is that  the  creative capacity to give form  far from  guarantees a break  from  the logic of “the  new  world order being dreamed up  by capitalism.” In a control  society,  modulatory controls work immanently to plastic  creation and  change, and  find  ways  to strategically revive old disciplinary moulds in key instants.
