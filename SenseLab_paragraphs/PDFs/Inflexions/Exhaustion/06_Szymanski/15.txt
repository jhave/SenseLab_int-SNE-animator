Deleuze may  have  advanced a “materialist psychiatry,” but his take on the brain couldn’t differ more  from material reductionist schemas. That’s because the materiality of the brain  is thoroughly “psychosocial,” a membrane at the limit of the desire and the social: “the brain is precisely this boundary of a continuous two- way  movement between an Inside  and  Outside, this  membrane between them” (Deleuze 1995: 176). Deleuze’s brain-as-screen is material; a materially constituted milieu  which  includes the  reality  of  relation between polymorphous  flows  of desire  (or “stimuli”). Read  in this  expanded sense,  the  brain  is indeterminate, a brain  for the making and  in the making, shaped by the movements of desire  that impress upon it. As Deleuze writes:  “Cerebral circuits  and  connections do  not preexist the  stimuli, the  corpuscles, or particles that  trace  them” (Deleuze 2000:
366).
