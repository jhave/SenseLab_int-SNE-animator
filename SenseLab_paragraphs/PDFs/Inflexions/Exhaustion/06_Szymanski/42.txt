[5] The  plastic  paradox that  I present here  is a  politicized variant  of  the  one presented by Norman Doidge in his book  The Brain that Changes Itself.  Doidge’s “plastic paradox” accounts for the brain’s duplicity, its ability  to be afflicted  or to be healed, or simply to yield  to influence. He describes the  paradox as follows: “the  same  plasticity which   allows   for  the  brain   to  change and  heal,  even  in adulthood, is also  the  same  plasticity that  reinforces patterns of behaviour and habits  of perception, and consequentially can entrench a number of disorders into the brain” (Doidge:  xx).
