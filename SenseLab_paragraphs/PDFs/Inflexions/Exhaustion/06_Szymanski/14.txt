to break from established analytic topographies are apt to explore  the neurological dimension. The real schism  between a reductionist scientism and  a politicization of subjectivity is that the former thinks  the brain in isolation, “outside of organism and  milieu” (Rose 2016), whereas the latter  thinks  the brain  as milieu,  “event,” or “screen” (Deleuze 2000: 366; Deleuze 1995: 176). By constructing an isolated brain as the essence  of subjectivity (and  psychological affliction),  neuroscience and  the hegemonic therapies  couched  in  it,  all  too  frequently  treat   the  “social   as  a supplement” (Rose  2016),  effectively   effacing  the  political   contingency  of  the brain’s plastic  composition.
