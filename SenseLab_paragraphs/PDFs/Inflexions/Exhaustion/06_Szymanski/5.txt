In an epoch  in which  more  people than  ever  have  access to professional mental health services,  more people than  ever find themselves depressed and living with disabling emotional pain. What is to be made  of this burning contradiction? In this paper I would like to suggest that  this contradiction can be partially understood through  the   paradoxical  ways   that   neuroplasticity  functions  in  a  neoliberal economy: as both the promise of better  mental health, and  the enabling condition for economic performances that exhaust and depress.
