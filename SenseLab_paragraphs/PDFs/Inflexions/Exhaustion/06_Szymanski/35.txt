If the individual is the product of power, and  if power subjects  the individual in such a way as to encourage its performance as modulatory “human” capital,  then there  is no reason to believe  that  the  individual’s ability  to creatively shape  the plastics  of its world would somehow mark  power’s undoing. Nor is there  reason to believe that therapeutic methods which encourage brain plasticity to move more in sync with  the economic demands of life under neoliberalism would somehow lead  to wellness or flourishing, even  if they  may  lead  to being  “symptom-free.” Plasticity, as much as flexibility, can constitute a total submission to the status quo, without us even being  cognizant of it—hence  the plastic  paradox. After all, there is nothing unusual about  desiring “the very thing that dominates and exploits us,” and thus  producing its (and by extension, our) very existence.
