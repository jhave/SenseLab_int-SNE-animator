According to Catherine Malabou, plasticity has become  “the dominant concept of the neurosciences.” “Today,” Malabou argues, “it constitutes their common point of interest, their  dominant motif,  and  their  privileged operating model, to  the extent  that  it allows  them  to think  about  the brain  as at once an unprecedented dynamic, structure, and   organization”  (Malabou 4).  The  brain’s  ability   to  be rewired, even into adulthood, has promised a new wave of hope for the treatment of “mental illnesses” (now  also frequently referred to as “brain disorders”) and  a host of other  conditions.
