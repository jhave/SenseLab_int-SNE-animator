One  might  equally well  speak  of new  kinds  of event,  rather than processes of subjectification:  events  that  can’t  be explained by the situations that give rise to them, or into which they lead. They appear for a moment, and  it’s that  moment that  matters, it’s the chance  we must  seize. Or we can simply talk about  the brain.  […] I think subjectification, events,  and  brains  are more  or less the same  thing. (Deleuze 1995: 176)
