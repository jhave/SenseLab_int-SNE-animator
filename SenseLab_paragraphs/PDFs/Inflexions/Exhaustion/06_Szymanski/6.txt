Neuroplasticity refers  to  the  brain’s  ability  to change, even  into  adulthood, as neurons “forge  new  connections, … blaze  new  paths through the  cortex,  [and] even  … assume new  roles.  In  shorthand,  neuroplasticity means   rewiring the brain”  (Schwartz and   Bigley  2002: 15).  The  discourse of  plasticity forms   the scientific ground upon which  the dominant medical strategies in place for treating depression are built.  The two most  practiced treatments for depression today are the prescription of psychotropic medication (antidepressants) and a modern form of psychotherapy known as Cognitive Behaviour Therapy. The rationale behind prescribing antidepressant medication is that  the depressed brain  has a chemical imbalance  that   can  be  regulated  through  medication. CBT  operates  on  the principle that depression is characterized by a deficit of accurate thinking, and that the depressed person’s thoughts are trapped within the “cognitive triad” (a reinforcing loop  of negative thoughts) which  makes  life situations seem  worse than  they  really  are.  What  undergirds both  this  former psychiatric practice and latter  psychological one (which  differ  quite  remarkably in their  approach but are often  practiced in  unison) is  the  neuroscientific discovery  that  the  brain   can change, either  by introducing new chemical compounds or thought patterns.
