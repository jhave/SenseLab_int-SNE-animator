[5] [A]s Robert Blackson puts it, reflecting on the phenomenon of false memory in relation to artistic re-enactments, “memory, like history, is a creative act”. If history and memory are creative acts, [...] history is always itself a re-enactment. For Collingwood, history can only be known though the performative identification of the historian with his subject [...] Pil and Gallia Kolletiv have noted that there is a way for this failure of
authenticity to function critically: “a historical moment is never new, which means that there is no original to repeat.” They continue, drawing on Michel Foucault’s notion of history without “landmark,” to argue that a “successful re-enactment would therefore
[produce a disloyalty to the point of origin which] does not amount to historical
relativism, but rather activates history from within the present, allowing us to move away
from the sterile attempt to cut through the infinite mediations of the spectacle.” (Jones
