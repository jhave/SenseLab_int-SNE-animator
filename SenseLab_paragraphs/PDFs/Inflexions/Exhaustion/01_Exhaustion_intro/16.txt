At  every  level,  individual or  collective,  in  everyday life as well as the reinvention of democracy (concerning town planning, artistic  creation, sport,  etc.), it is a question in each instance of looking  into what  would be the dispositives of the production of subjectivity, which tends towards an individual and/or collective  resingularization, rather than  that  of mass- media manufacture, which  is synonymous with  distress and despair. (Guattari 2000: 33-34)
