If anything, this issue  of Inflexions points out that  the notion of care needs to  go  beyond  the  human, that   it  needs   to  acknowledge  the  complex imbrication of mental, social and  environmental ecologies.  This is because exhaustion itself traverses existential territories in complex ways, with each drained existence  (human and  non-human) putting others  on the line. Therefore “Modes of Exhaustion” calls for practices of co-composing modes of existence  across  the  three  ecologies,  with  and  through exhaustion as a threshold towards other  possible worlds.
