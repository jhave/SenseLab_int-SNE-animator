It is commonplace to observe that,  in today’s societies  of connectivity, our lives are  constantly tracked, our  behaviour is checked, our  performances assessed. Anxious to meet  the requirements of quantitative “performance indicators,” we hardly ever  get to do  our  actual  work,  bring  our  work  to full  term,   or  decidedly  refuse   work—work,  produce,  work,   produce, endlessly. As the late Mark  Fisher  suggested, the amount of work  we do actually keeps us from being productive in an emphatic sense of the word, that   is,  developing  creative  ways   of  encountering  the  various (philosophical, artistic,  etc.) problems posed by existence.  Instead, we feed the field of social  and  economic relations that  exhaust us as we run  after deadlines, fulfil quotas and  complete administrative chores.  Even  outside of our strictly  professional occupations, we perceive an increased pressure to perform our  (active,  popular, successful) selves  who  participate in the experience economy. It appears that  Fear  of Missing  Out  intensified by social media that are “always on” only further increases their use which,  in turn,   causes   sleep   deprivation  and   exhaustion  (Levenson et  al.  2016).
