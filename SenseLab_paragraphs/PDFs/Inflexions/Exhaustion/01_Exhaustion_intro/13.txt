possibilities of existing  at the limit, which  is the overall  definition of life for both   Gilles   Deleuze  and   Gilbert   Simondon  (Deleuze  1990:  104).  If exhaustion becomes  an approximation of the limit,  this is because it is far from any association with tiredness, as Deleuze points out in his essay “The Exhausted.”  Exhaustion  as   a   limit-concept  allows    us   to   verge    on nothingness as a creative and intense state whose  other  side might  be chaos where nothing is possible. While the Nodes of this issue concern explicitly the modes of exhaustion and their relation to the limit, the contributions to the  Tangents explore  more  how  to work  along  the  limits  of the  possible through exhaustion. Thus  the Nodes and  Tangents maintain a certain autonomy from  each  other  and,  at  the  same  time,  are  traversed by  the creative forces of exhaustion echoing  Inflexions’ emphasis on research- creation. In other  words, the formats might  differ between the two sections but their  shared interest resides in exploring what  exhaustion as a concept and practice can do and  might  become.
