Exhaustion is very  different from  increasingly schematized psycho-social occurrences such as burn-out. While burn-out seems to relate to the state of being overworked and thus  somewhat dysfunctional for the place one supposedly  holds   in  the   assembly  line  of  capitalist  value   extraction, exhaustion has a limit-quality. From  this  point  of view,  exhaustion is the field effect of a relational operation moving across different strata of human and  more-than-human factors  tweaking the  capacities of an  assemblage, such as the human or animal body,  but also the technological ensembles of machines or information networks. Exhaustion as a peaking of intensities can lead to complete breakdown and  death but also effectuate shifts in the overall mesh of relations in order to enable unforeseen potentials. From this point   of  view,   exhaustion should  not  be  considered as  a  generalized assertion of our contemporary socio-technological state of being exceeding what  we are “capable of” or can “bear  with.”  On the contrary, we wonder how exhaustion can allow us to problematize the constant interpellation of being active without merely opposing it to a deliberate passivity, but rather as an immanent critique of a reduced understanding of activity  susceptible to surplus extraction. And, on the other hand, we ask how exhaustion might become  a  creative technique to  radically alter  the  redundant extractive modes of activity.  Exhausted bodies  and  collectives  perceive and  create differently, thus challenging the business-as-usual of the depleting routine. In  other  words, we  ask  how  exhaustion can  be  inflected towards new
