It is in the experimental challenges of but also the capacities for immanent critique through research-creation that  we further venture collectively into the problem of exhaustion. Directly in resonance with the place from which our  questions emerged, Peter  Pál  Pelbart  gives  a moving account of the Ueinzz  Theater Company composed by schizophrenics during a (different) stay   in   Amsterdam.  This   touching  eulogy    for   Pelbart’s   friend   and collaborator Alexandre is also a powerful reminder that  the recomposition of our  social ecologies  is a matter of life and  death for individuals whose mental ecology  diverges from the imposed norm.  This, too, is research- creation in the mode  of writing. Alanna Thain explores the productive enunciative position that  Gilles Deleuze created for the filming  of his Abécédaire with  Claire  Parnet. Insisting that  the interviews should only  be published posthumously, Deleuze speaks to us as if from  the  dead. This kind of thinking and speaking as if one’s life was already spent,  exhausted, is an act of research-creation directly leaping into others’ lives, like the ones watching  the   Abécédaire now.   Moving  beyond  a  linguistic  mode   of exploring exhaustion, Nicole  de Brabandere’s “experimental media ecologies” show  how  the exhaustion of certain  perceptual habits  can open up  towards new  and  more  emphatically ecological  modes of perception.
