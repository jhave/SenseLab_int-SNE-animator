This is what  the contributions do in one way or another in this issue: They traverse emergent existential territories of different registers to articulate ways  of being  that,  for instance, affirm  an environmental ecology  through the recomposition of a social ecology.  This becomes  evident in Barbara Glowczewski’s plea  for new  cross-ontological alliances  which  shows  that feminist and Indigenous activist projects are stronger and more efficient for conceiving transversal relations between their different ontologies. Clearly, the key to such endeavours does not lie in a single worldview that is shared by  all  allies.  Rather,  these  projects  are  first  and  foremost about  finding pragmatic,  albeit   provisional, answers  to  the  question,  “can  one  pass through here, and how?”  (Pignarre and Stengers 2011: 8). Working through this question never  produces a general answer, let alone a general solution to  the  problem of  exhaustion. The  answers given  in  the  contributions collected  here  are  always singular, responding to and  working with  the conditions of the situation that raised  the question in the first place. In other words, they  propose ecological  modes of co-composing with  and  through exhaustion  at   the   limit   of  what   it   can   do,   both,   conceptually and pragmatically. The examples discussed by Glowczewski give a sense of the rich  variety of social  alliances  and  formations that  can  (re-)create a new sensibility  for  relating  to  the  environment,  while   moving  across   and between different limits.
