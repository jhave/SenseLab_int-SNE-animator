Similar  modes of extraction account for the  material and  environmental conditions of the planet in a devastating downward spiral. In what has been called the age of the Anthropocene, the bleak state of the environment, threatened by global  warming, mass  extinction, and  forced  displacement, drains individuals and  collectives  of their  futurity, making it harder to imagine other  futures. In that  sense,  the environmental exhaustion of the planet doubles in an exhaustion of the potential to think  and  act constructively.
