challenge for the  attentional capacities of the  collective.  What  makes  the individualâ€™s work  recognizable to the institution dissolves the cohesion of a social formation. We have learned (once again)  from this experience that the creation of a generative event  ecology  requires a particular care for the various existential territories intersecting within it.  While  we  may  have missed the chance  to engage in an immanent critique of the format in the moment of being together, the event  continues to unfold. The shared sense of exhaustion generated a care for collective modes of thinking and making, a care whose  repercussions nurture this issue of Inflexions in another space and time. We conceive of this issue of Inflexions as an extension of the limits of what  we  thought and  felt  in  Amsterdam, now  through an  extended ecology of practices beyond the shared experience.
