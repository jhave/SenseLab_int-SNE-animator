of social relations and  obligations; and  what  kinds  of spatio-temporal compositions might  constitute these  vacuoles? With  this  question we, the editors and  authors, want  to approach a multi-faceted conception of exhaustion turning a set of relations not  only  against itself,  as we  might observe through the  social  in  social  media, but  also  as  a  limit  concept extending  the  boundaries  of  the  possible  both   in  its  devastating and potentializing ways.  In a sense, then,  we are proposing an ethology of and for exhaustion, a study of the conducts that  got us here and  the techniques that might  allow us to create with and through it.
