In  regular  kneading  operations, the  substance  of  clay,  or  dampened soil,  is sustained in  a continuous movement of emergent surfacing and  aggregate re- composition. When  different membranes are kneaded into the substance, there  is an intense tension that  slows attention from the repeated rotational movement to the  way  the  surface  pulls,  presses and  resurfaces against the  membrane. This process exhausts multiple registers of intense alignment between feeling and form, including the  rhythmic continuity of kneading (which  was  a practice that  I had inhabited after  several  years  of throwing pottery), the mass  of clay as a distinct and  homogenous material, and  the clear distinction between surfaces involved in the kneading process  (the surface  of clay, skin, membrane and surface  of the table or  floor  on  which  the  clay  is kneaded). The  intense resonances that  emerged through the operation gave germ to a series of operations involving kneading foil, balloons, nylon  and charcoal  powder into clay (De Brabandere 2015).
