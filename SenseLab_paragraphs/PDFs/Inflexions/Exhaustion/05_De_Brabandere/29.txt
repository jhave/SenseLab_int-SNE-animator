The rhythm that intensely degrades the difference between particulate volumes of dirt  and  the plastic  drop sheet  (described in the introduction) or that  softens  the surface  of glass in rolling,  plastic undulations (in the operation of rolling  clay over charcoal-coated glass), or that  presses the balloon  between viscous  and  elastic intensities in the above  description, continues to activate an intense consistency between surface  and  position. This time the rhythm kneads the aggregate surface of pavement in increasing and  decreasing acceleration with  the pace  of walking. The rhythm kneads the aggregate ground between swathing contours as it accelerates, and  a grazing staccato  as the movement slows  into position (see Fig.
4). The video  image  emerges when holding the  video  camera downward while walking, and  to the side to avoid  letting  walking feet enter  into the frame.  In co- composing the  variable pace  of  walking with  the  surface   of  asphalt, and  the distance to the ground from the waist  down, the virtual intensity of the animetic interval emerges. The relation between movement and distance travelled, and the relation between image  capture and  the number of steps  taken  (and  the rate with which  they  punctuate time  in position) exhausts, while  the alignment of surface and direction intensifies.
