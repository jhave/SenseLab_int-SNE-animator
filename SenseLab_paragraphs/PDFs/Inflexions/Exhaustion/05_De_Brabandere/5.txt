In experimental media ecologies that stage analogue techniques for video capture, the videographic surface becomes an intense topography of emergent form-taking. Sequence hops, skips and jumps between stretch  and release, depth and proximity, dispersion and  contraction. Gestures start  to pull  at the space before and  beneath the  walls,  perhaps to the  beat  of knocking to listen  for tone,  through irregular densities of plaster, or that  of listening through the  viscosity  of amniotic fluid. Rhythms of walking collide  with  the  vibratory resonance of impact, absorbing sequence, between shades of flat black and  thick white.  Plastic becomes  elastic as tendons extend beyond how far you thought you could  reach. The dissociation of movement from  a recognizable source  or sequence in the  experimental ecology intensifies the tension between continuous time and  the dynamics of topographic composition. This  activates an  intense consistency, before  there  is an  order of cause,  dimension, surface,  trajectory or duration, where past  worlds co-compose in the present. This is a multiple and  variable consistency, where an unexpected resonance can take renewed hold on thought and attention all at once, generating precise  breaks  that  are  hard enough to forge  new  forms  and  intense relational alliances.
