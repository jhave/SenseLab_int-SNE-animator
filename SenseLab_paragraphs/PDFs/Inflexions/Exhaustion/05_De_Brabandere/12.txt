Susanne Langer  suggests that  we  recognize form  through an inhabited alliance with  feeling.  Langer  elaborates the  example, of  an  undulating line,  where an inhabited alliance with direction gives the line virtual movement affects (1953: 65). The co-composition between inhabited tendency and  objective  form  is not  fixed but  exhausts as tendencies of form recognition take on new  emphasis in situated ecologies of practice. For instance, if one emphasizes the rhythm of the undulations over  the  lineâ€™s  directionality, the  line  seems  to  repeatedly impact the  surface instead of move  over  it. When  the  edges  of the  line come  into  tension with  the surface  of the page  it can seem as through the line carves  a path  through a thick, gummy surface,  where direction slows  in the  sticky  mass.  The thought of these dynamic relations of emergent abstraction are felt, as emergent intensity, and  the precise  relations of corporeal abstraction that  give it force, can only be identified after the fact.
