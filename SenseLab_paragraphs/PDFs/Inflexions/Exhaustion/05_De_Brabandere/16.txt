In activating the  concept  of exhaustion in  the  experimental milieu,  I need  not exhaust a complete subject (towards death). Instead, I attend with how particular inhabited tendencies fall in and  out  of register, how  they  resonate with  formerly unassociated dimensions of the inhabited past.  This is a living  dive  without the top-down order of gravity, where the  elastic  need  not  snap  back  into  formerly given terms  for inhabiting and recognizing corporeality. Deleuze calls the content of this  process  “impoverished,” but  its intangibility finds  force in growing new legs, and the potential to inhabit an emergent world before it is practiced.
