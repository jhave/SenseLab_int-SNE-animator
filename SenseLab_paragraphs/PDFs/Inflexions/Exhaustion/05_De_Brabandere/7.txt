technique, and calls it “technicity”: “[t]echnicity sets the conditions for successive operations, each of which incorporates the implicit, creating an opening toward an ecology of experimentation” (2013: 35). The experimental ecology, then, is both the outcome and  the means  by which  inhabited techniques develop and  exhaust. For instance, in tending with the relations that co-compose in combing hair, the length of cut hair might  fall out of synch with each successive stroke, and the mass of hair might  all of a sudden become operative as an intense, lengthening and contracting elasticity. But the  intense openings and  exhaustions in the  technicity of experimental media operations are only partial, and  draw emphasis gradually, in poking  and   prodding  the   rote   continuity  of  habit   from   different  registers, durations and dimensions of attention.
