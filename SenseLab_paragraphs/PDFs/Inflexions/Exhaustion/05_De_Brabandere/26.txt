The  surface  of a marbled balloon  no  longer  presses, stretches and  contracts in relation with  the  dynamic pressures of kneading clay but  invites  the  surface  of video  capture to stretch  and  contract with  its  movement (see Fig. 3). Now  the balloon  surface  is stretched over  the  entire  surface  of the  frame,  while  a finger presses into  and  distorts its  marbled contours from  behind. One  can  quickly identify the marbled contours that  differentiate areas  of the video  surface,  but as the   surface   is  stretched  and   distorted  by  an  invisible   source,   the   objective difference  between  layers   of  lens  and   balloon   breaks   down.  The  stretching
