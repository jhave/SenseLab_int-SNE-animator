operational dynamics of the animetic machine, I develop an analytic of emergent corporeal abstraction (or the felt thought of inhabited tendency as it comes  into new   intense relation  with   the  inhabited past).   Unlike   the  pervasive cultural tendency to presume a deterministic relation between identification and the lived ecology, I invoke  the identification of form as part  of a “science of the possible.” In the “science of the possible,” distinct entities  implode and fold over themselves as they integrate intensities that are not definable by a co-ordinate system,  a sequence of events  or a stable  relation with  feeling.  Through this process, artefacts remain that  are prone to dislodge from  their  order of cause  at any  moment. In turn,  the artefacts of this  intense science  are  also prone to help  activate diverse technical ecologies,  by making palpable the emergence of felt thought. [2]
