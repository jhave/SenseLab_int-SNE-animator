When the line begins to behave like a fold, or derive tendencies of folding from the inhabited past,  it emphasizes the role of surface  dimensions, rather than  merely linear  dimension, in  the  form-taking ecology.  Such  a  change of  emphasis can generate openings for experimentation with the way surfaces exhaust and become lines  (when directional vectors  activate surface  tension, or when a page  lifts to reveal  its cross-sectional edge),  or when lines exhaust to become  topographic (as they  widen and  smear  or  bleed  through the  fibres  of a page).  This  change in dimensional and directional emphasis is felt as much as it is activated in the media ecology  and  becomes  perceptible by analyzing the relational dynamics of the emergent forms  that  it generates. The  affective  coincidence of line  and  surface compels me to inhabit the “any-space-whatever” where attention flickers  in and out,  long  enough for lines  and  surfaces to resonate with  dimensions that  are  in excess  of  Euclidian  spacetime—where  the  page  becomes   equivalent with  the surface  of skin, or where the floor seems to harden as the legs walking over it start to tire and  weaken. Or in an instant, banal  forms  acquire a newfound urgency to stand tall as the voice starts to pulse  in and out in nervous, fumbled and fumbling speech.
