In  this  rendering of  divergent series,  there  is  no  singular, recurrent relation. Instead, what  recurs  is the  way  the  different elements of the  animetic machine exhaust existing  tendencies of intense relation by activating intense openings for emergent  form-taking.  One   of  these   elements  includes  the  fixity  of  camera position, which  exhausts the intense capture of cinematic camera movement, by intensifying the emergent form-taking in the movement and  quality of co- composing, animetic layers.  Another emerges in how editing out the clues that fix the  animetic machine  to  its  objective   components, whether  in  framing or  in splitting  the   clip,  exhausts  tendencies  of  equating  optical   recognition  with infallible  perception. The recovery from exhaustion, through emergent form, does not remain allied  to any single  mode  of inhabited alignment, but resonates transversally. In turn  the  virtual movement of linear  form  might  vibrate out  of intense directionality, and  the intense flatness  of everyday architectural surfaces might  acquire new  give. The dynamism of these  intense alignments changes the emphasis in how  the  past  is derived in the present, a process  whose  impact can only be identified partially, after the fact. At the same time, the partial lineages of intense relation that emerge in this process  become  perceptible through the traces of divergent series (in this case the video  renderings). By attending with  and articulating the  emergent alignments of  form  and  intensity in  the  traces  and
