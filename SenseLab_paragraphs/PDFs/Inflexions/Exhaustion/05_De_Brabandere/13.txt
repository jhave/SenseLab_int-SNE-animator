Val√©ry  describes the  informing dynamics of situated ecologies  in the  context  of operations of drawing texture, where a clear  form  is not  given,  but  emerges by tending with  the movements and  qualities of emergent process  (1938: 77). As the specific  qualities of the  rendering ecology  generate intense tensions, they  also inform how the texture is rendered and  perceived. This intensity might  emerge in the way a smooth surface  informs a contour that seems to accelerate, or the way a contour rendered with  drying ink  informs the  way  a surface  seems  to become dense  and  textured. [1] The inform  emerges in the  experimental ecology  as the
