The regular rhythm of the earlier examples remains exhausted, while the irregular movement relation between surface  and  form  begins  to amplify. White  sheets  of paper with   edges   aligned  along   the  horizontal  axis  of  the  frame   move   and undulate in relation with  each  other  (see Fig. 6). Now  the  glass  is gone  but  the vague appearance of rolling  lingers,  as the lifting and lowering pages seem to roll. The gap between the edges  articulates a contour of varying width as the edges  of the  pages  impact and  separate to  reveal  a black  ground underneath. Then  the edges   impact  and   align,   all  of  the  sudden,  and   draw  a  contour  in  perfect synchronicity by sliding the point  of contact  between the two sheets  in a smooth crescendo. While  watching to identify a clear  difference between the  composite layers   of  pages   and   ground,  a  contour  emerges  that   activates  an   intense, inseparable relation between them.
