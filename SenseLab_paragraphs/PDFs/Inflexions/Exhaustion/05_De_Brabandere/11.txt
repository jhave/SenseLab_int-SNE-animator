decomposition of the  self” (Deleuze 1997: 154). In the any-space-whatever there is “equality between the straight line and  the plane,  and  between the plane  and the volume” (Deleuze 1997: 160; De Brabandere 2015). Exhaustion is then  a state that activates an opening for recomposing given tendencies of perceiving form and dimension. Exhaustion opens  up  the potential to experiment with  tendencies of perception that tend to draw quick conclusions from the lived ecology, a potential that Deleuze calls a “science of the possible” (1997: 154).
