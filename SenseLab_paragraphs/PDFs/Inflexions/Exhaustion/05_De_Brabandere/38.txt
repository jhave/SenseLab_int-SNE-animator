In the  next  operation, the  appearance of the  movement of dust,  and  that  of the movement of vibration linger,  as does  the  dimension of the  line as an animetic layer.  A  charcoal-coated elastic  string   is strung over  a  white  ground and  the position of the video  camera is facing top-down (see Fig. 8). The tied  ends  of the string  are cut from  the frame  so that  the dimensions of the videographic staging become  less  clear.  When  the  taut  string  is disturbed it  oscillates,  and  releases charcoal  dust.  In the vibration the string  doubles and  falls out of focus, such  that it is not clear whether the charcoal  powder is falling off the string,  or whether the string  is transforming into powder. The convergence of line and  dust  co-compose an intense, durational atmosphere where cause and  effect fall out of focus. Before the  oscillation  stops,   and   before  the  animetic intensity  dampens  to  reveal   a motionless, singular string  (that is vulnerable to the optical  space of intense object capture), the video  footage  is edited to cut between forward and reverse, drawing a last gasp from the intense indeterminacy between movement and image capture.
