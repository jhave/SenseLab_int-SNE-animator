The animetic interval thus  opens  a space-time where the continuous succession of images  variably swells  and  folds  with  emergent techniques of movement and attention. Time  is  no  longer   an  abstract continuity, but  inflates,   absorbs and stretches with  the non-linear dynamics of emergent movement and  attention that derive  new   resonances  with   the   inhabited  past.   The   intense  alignment  of continuous succession and  situated relations of practice puts  the fixed position of camera position, and  the infallibility of its capture in tension. As different modes, movements and dimensions, confront the relentless drive  of continuous time, they fold and  spread new  intense textures that  defy  any  single  direction or sequence. Anticipation congeals at the threshold of continuity and change, where tendencies of recognition reveal  the  thought of  their  own  anticipation, where lifting  and landing  seem   to  cut   between  forward  and   reverse.  As  this   compositional dynamism gives  momentum to  the  emergent form  of composite layers,  it also permeates the flesh, and  is strong enough to smoothen a nervous tremble into a thinning contour. The following sequence of descriptions traces a lineage  across a divergent  series,   where  the  movement  of  the  operation  moves  to  make   the transitions between frames  (both  intense and  objective)  apprehensible relative to a fixed camera position.
