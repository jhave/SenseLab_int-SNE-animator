The co-composition of discontinuous surfaces in the spacetime of video animation activates a technical consistency for experimenting with the relation between force and   form,   position  and   dimension,  recognition  and   affect.  Thomas  Lamarre explains the  importance of the  animation stand in  emphasizing the  “animetic interval” or the space between the layered planes of the animated image,  relative to mechanical succession (as compared to the continuous movement of the camera in  classical  cinema):  “[b]ecause of  the  relative immobility of  the  camera, the emphasis in  animation often  falls  on  drawing the  successive movements from frame to frame”  rather than the content of each individual frame (2009: xxiv). This change in the emphasis in the relations of image capture is critical, since it prolongs the space where form and  feeling  co-compose. Here,  emergent, situated relations can  begin  to co-compose with  tendencies of intense alignment, in relation with sequence:
