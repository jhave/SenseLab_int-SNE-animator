The even rhythm of walking or of the glass that once pressed against heaving clay, returns as an irregular variation as the top-most layer of the animetic interval rolls and presses against a brittle, and slightly  irregular charcoal  stick (see Fig. 5). Now the  camera is positioned facing  downward over  a glass  surface  that  exerts  an invisible  tension over  the  charcoal  stick,  rolling  it jerkily  back  and  forth  on  its horizontal axis. The glass agitates the surface  of the charcoal  stick, exhausting its virtual alignment with the direction of linear proportion, under the pressing pane. The source  of movement remains undetermined until,  under increasing pressure, an  irregularity in  form  or  density cause  the  stick  to  crack,  exposing the  glass surface with a bursting spray of dust that coats its underside dimension. This quick release  of material tension affectively coincides with  the deflation of the intense anticipation of the animetic interval, where attention returns to identifying cause and effect.
