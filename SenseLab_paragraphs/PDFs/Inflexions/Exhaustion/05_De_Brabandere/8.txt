In this article, I engage what  Thomas Lamarre (2009) calls the “Animetic Interval” in an experimental ecology  of video  animation. To do so, I engage the qualities of this  technicity from  three  different modes of entry.  These  are divided into  parts and  include 1) Emergent Form  and  Exhaustion in Experimental Process,  2) The “Animetic Interval” and  3) Divergent Series of the Animetic Interval. This organization weaves content between my  own  analysis of experimental media operations and a number of references that elaborate the dynamics of attention in the apprehension of emergent form. In some instances, the writing presented here changes register so that  it can resonate more  closely with  the intensity of specific media operations. At the same  time,  I aim to draw explicit  conclusions from this multi-modal process and make its instances of critical relevance clear to the reader.
