A clear plastic drop-sheet is stretched over and beyond the frame of video capture (see Fig. 1). The plastic surface  agitates a heap of fine dirt as it tightens and relaxes under changing air pressure and  the changing weight of the bouncing volume of dirt. The grains  gently  elongate diagonally over the plastic  skin, reverberating the form of the caving plastic  surface  in the lifting and jumbling particulate collisions. The contour holds at the limit between form and dispersion, between the incessant lifting  and   landing of  its  own  weight. The  bouncing rhythm draws  powder contours by shivering volumes, between contour and  surface,  in jumbling, multi- sidedness. As volumes of dirt  turn  in on themselves, they activate an intense and fleeting  resonance between the surface  of the plastic  sheet and the contour of each particle. These underside or inside  movements, exhaust and recombine tendencies of recognizing the relation between surface  and  form, as well as cause and  effect, activating a virtual dynamism that is in excess of frame sequence.
