Now the clay is no longer  a balled mass, but a felt tension on the surface,  where its rhythmic tension between surface  and  rhythm remains as it is rolled  into  a slab that is placed on top of glass coated  with charcoal bits (see Fig. 2). The movement becomes  the rhythmic, pressing and  lifting of a rolling  pin against the top-side of the clay slab. Now the surface  of video co-composes with the surface  of clay as the view of the video  camera is positioned under the glass to frame  the action.  In the video  capture, the visible plastic,  rolling,  pressing, appears to stretch  the charcoal contours flush  against the  smooth glass  surface.  The slowly  stretching charcoal contours appear to heave  the weight of the bulk of the clay, but also the screen, or the  lens,  in  waves.   The  glass  surface   becomes   intensely continuous with  the emergent surfacing of  clay,  through the  appearance of  a  moving image   that exceeds   identifiable  cause   and   effect.  This   process   haemorrhages  a  gaping potential in the operational ecology, such that it is prone to gather up new surfaces, rhythms and  volumes in order to resolve  the problem of irresolvable surface dimension.
