I prepare my  naked body  with  two  orthotics:  a dental mouth opener and  a posture corrector especially built for the performance.
The body  is tied  to the posture corrector, which  is T-shaped, with  horizontal strings.
It is positioned alongside the  spinal  cord,  forcing  the  body  to  be  erect  and
immobilizing the arms.
