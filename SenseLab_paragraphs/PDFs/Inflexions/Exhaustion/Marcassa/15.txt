It is that  the old body  sees the ocean  for the first time. With the mellow wave which calms the nerves, the body begins to dress only in white. Shaves the head and  sows  the stretch  marks  which  scar the womb,  now  the open  fissure  of an animal gusted with stripes. Learns to control  losing control  itself: vomits  at the right  time, chews  with  orthodontic mouth openers, controls the movements of a  twisted body,  the  lashings which  flog  the  slave’s  body.  Swallows dense batches  of the hair of the head  just in front, till it is all in the throat, spits it out again  with  the certainty that  there  wasn’t  more  to swallow. Sticks needles in between the nail and the flesh—subtle, delicate gesture—no longer  is it known where lies the  beauty and  the  horror. Throws itself naked against the  walls. Reckons  forces with  the other: slap in the face, exhaustive scream,  stone  in the hair.  A reckoning of forces  which  has  nothing to do  with  the  affirmation of oneself,  nothing can be said under the sign of a dialectic,  if man  or woman, if white  or black, if rich or poor.  The reckoning of forces comes  from the body’s effort  to make  itself  expressed. It is more  than  a reckoning, the  body  enters entirely in an effort, a tension which  it lives, expressing itself there  with  all the marks,  the collapses, the pains,  the stuttering disgraces of a body. And  creates with them.  The stuttering body,  rumpled, anxious, grabs the roça, the cow shit. Death,  the  bones,  the  surgical instruments, the  suffering and  the  blood,  the aristocratic blood  and  the hardened religion,  sex, nakedness and  the skin, premature ejaculation and  masturbation, the pain,  the stone,  the tension. And a life which  insists,  art.
