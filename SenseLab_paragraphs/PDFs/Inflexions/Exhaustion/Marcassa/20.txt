[3] Roça can  be used  both  as a noun  and  as a verb.  As a verb,  of which  the infinitive is roçar, it means  to rub. However, in Brazil, the word, used  as a verb, and  especially in rural  contexts,  adds to its meaning the act of chopping down vegetation. The verb,  under both  its senses,  has  been  substantialized to also designate the place where this action takes place.
