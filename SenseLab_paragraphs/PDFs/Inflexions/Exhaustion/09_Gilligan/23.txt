A television program begins  to play  on  the  screen  in front  of the  class.  The TV show  starts  with  a commercial for the Patch.  It shows  a simple  line animation. In the animation, we zoom  through many  points in space  and  stop  at two  floating circles.  The  off-screen   voice  of  a  product  designer for  the  Patch  narrates the scene.
