A lot  of new  users  are  worried about   thought-bleed and  you’re right  to be concerned because when it comes  down to it there  are no clear lines between feeling  and  thought. But there  are strict laws protecting your  privacy of thought, whatever company you  use. The  catch   area   only   includes  those   thoughts  connected  to  the feeling,  so like when she makes  you angry, “you bitch!” might  leak through. You gotta  watch  for that.   But once you get the hang  of it, it’s like riding a bike. It shouldn’t be a problem.
