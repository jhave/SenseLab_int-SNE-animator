I would like to present to you  the Two-Way. It is the first two-way entrainment device  where users  send  their  experience and  receive at   the   same   time   (audience  applauds   enthusiasm).  We   have overcome incredible obstacles in hardware and  software design to bring  this product to the market today. This device  is going  to blow your  mind.
