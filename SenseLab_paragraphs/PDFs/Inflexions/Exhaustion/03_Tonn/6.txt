↓ I practice becoming still as a rock. I freeze my limbs flat against the floor. I force my eyes still, freeze  the movement of the images  flowing by behind the eyelids, like a film coming  to a clean  stop  in the midst of a rolling  motion. I picture one single monolithic core sample hovering in dark  space. It is pristine like “The Blue Marble,” the last picture taken  by human hands of the earth  from space. This will help.  I stop  breathing, and  hear  the blood  raging louder past  my eardrums. The tense pull of my eyes seem to slowly  dissolve. When  I open  my eyes I am able to focus  once  again  on  a still point  at the  ceiling.  Earlier  that  day  the  neurologist had  asked  me to walk up and  down the floor in a straight line. Then he asked  me to  follow  the  movement of his  fingers.  Left  to  right  and  back.  From  center  to periphery. He  pinched my  arms  as  he  asked  me  to  remember three  things:  a house,   a  tree  and   a  car.  While   lying   on  the  crisp   hospital  bed  the  fear  of forgetting those  three  words cultivated a hard rock  in my  stomach. That  day  it felt like something in my  field  of vision  had  shifted, as if the  world as I saw  it had  been  transformed into  a magic-eye image,  where you  have  to defocus your eyes to see the hidden new shapes emerge.
