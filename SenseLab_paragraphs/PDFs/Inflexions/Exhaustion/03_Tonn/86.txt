↓  I  sleep   in  my  little  orange  tent,   behind  the  dusty  shelves.   My  tools   for measurement and  recording lie  scattered around  the  site.  I dream that  I am buying a house  from a man  and  a woman. They are architects but have  taken  on the role of real estate  agents  (Gins and  Arakawa 2002: 23). The house  is nothing more  than  a pile  of strangely shaped surfaces held  together with  a transparent rubbery material. It covers  a vast  area.  The Ubiquity House they  call it, and  the lady,  Madeline, offers me to enter  the house.  “In order to enter  you have  to pick up  the  slippery fabric  of the  house  and  insert  yourself into  it,”  she  says.  I am skeptical, but  let’s  be  honest, I was  skeptical of the  core  sample warehouse at first, and  look at the interdependence with  which  I am now  taking  refuge  in all its archival thoroughness.
