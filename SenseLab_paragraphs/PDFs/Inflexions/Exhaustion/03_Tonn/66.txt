â†“ The archive  behind the  zoological museum in Copenhagen comes  to mind.  I visited it in the winter with  my father,  and  a charismatic young man  in military boots  took  us  on  the  tour  of  the  collection.   I had  brought a  3D  scanner and wanted to  capture the  most  spectacular  specimen. A  strong stench   of  whale bones  being  cleaned in formaldehyde made  the air almost  unbearable to breathe, so  distracting that  my  3D  scans  came  out  completely perforated  with  holes, making the animals look like horrible cases of chemical deformation. Along  the beautiful dark  wood vitrines thousands of taxidermy animals looked  out  with beady  glass  eyes. A male  bison  had  been  rolled  out  on its little  trolley  legs, and was  standing like a sad and  gigantic ghost,  its brown mane  shredding pieces  on the floor.
