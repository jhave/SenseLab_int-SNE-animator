â†“ I am  getting asthmatic from  staying in  the  core  sample warehouse and  the nausea is not  improving. While  the  architecture of the  core  sample warehouse previously reminded me of the  sediments of the  earth  it now  feels like a damp labyrinth. The warehouse is never  quiet.  There is an incessant hum  from the fluorescent  tubes   and   the   climate   control   system   that   seem   to  vibrate  my eardrums. I spend days  just  focusing and  defocusing my  eyes  at  a  far  away point,  out of touch  with  what  I came for. The keeper takes  pity  on me and  offers to take me to the gas fields to pick up some core samples, and  we take his pickup truck  up north. When  we reach the field the keeper has aged  several  decades. He is frailer  and  milder, more  distinguished. I never  noticed the  mustache and  the impressive bushy eyebrows until  now  (but  I might  still  be unable to  properly focus). Neither his black crooked cane, as if it had  just grown out  of him. As we stand on  the  grounds of the  extraction plant  he  knocks  lightly  on  the  massive metal  canister filled with  earth  gas. It looks  like a fat, lazy  caterpillar spreading
