marathons.  I  feel  a  strong  urge   to  witness  this   strive   towards  the  bliss  of exhaustion, and  buy  a ticket  to the Balaton  lake in Hungary where the next race will  take  place.  I meet  the  man  in  the  airport, and  on  the  train  down from Budapest  he  explains  his  anticipation. During  his  first  race  in  Norway  last summer he  met  what   he  calls  Nirvana. He  had  not  prepared for  the  race  in Norway at all. He did  not get enough sleep  and  food. He was sleeping on a cold floor at the communal showers, where an automatic light would go on and  wake him up every  time someone came in. And  at a certain  point,  after having run  for hours on  end,   he  started  hallucinating. At  one  point   he  thought  the  other contestants were  crusaders that  were  chasing him.  He  perceived some  kind  of divine power, which  spoke  to him  and  said  that  it wanted him  to win  this  race. This was  the wildest and  purest he had  ever felt. Eventually he broke  down. He didnâ€™t finish  the race, but  went  to a hotel  nearby and  lay on the bed staring into the dark  for days.
