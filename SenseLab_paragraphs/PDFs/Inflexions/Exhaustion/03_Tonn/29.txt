â†“  The  Rotliegend  Formation,  better   known as  the  Groningen  Gas  Field,  has yielded earth  gas since the 1950s. It whistles through long  manufactured straws, perforating the salt layer shield.  Within  a few years after the discovery of the gas, pipes  grew  out  of the  region  and  spread into  the  rest  of the  country, and  soon after  across  Europe and  even  North Africa.  The gas  not  immediately used  was pumped back into the natural reservoirs deep  below  the Zechstein seal, dormant until  needed again.
