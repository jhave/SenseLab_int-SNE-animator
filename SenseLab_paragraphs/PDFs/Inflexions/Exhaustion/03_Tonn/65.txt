â†“  Archives  are  material  accumulations  that   help   us  think   beyond  our   own lifespan. They  help  us  notice  of  how  we  and   the  world around us  change. Natural archives have  origin  in a desire  to categorize the  entire  natural world into   neatly    annotated  boxes   and   binders.  This   desire    emerged  with   the exploration and  exploitation of land  under the  colonial  era.  It is the  desire  to tame  and  utilize  the vast  bounty of nature. Victorian botanists nailed  butterflies to  cork  boards. They  would name  them  after  elaborate  classification systems, because if you could  name  them  you could  own them.
