The couple  asks  me to be more  of a human-snail than  a human when living  in this house.  They ask me to do human-snail DR. I think  of the small  mollusks that wash  up on the shore close to my house.  Rather  than  a smooth hard surface  some of the snail houses resemble a sponge or a cauliflower, due  to rising  acidification of the  ocean.  Snails  have  successfully obtained the  unimaginable quest  of flesh merging into  shelter,  as they  erase  the  boundaries between themselves and  the environment. I feel a chill down my  spine  realizing that  the unavoidable being- with the environment is the snailâ€™s bad luck.
