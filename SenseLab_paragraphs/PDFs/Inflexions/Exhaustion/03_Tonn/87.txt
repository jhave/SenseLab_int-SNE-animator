The  house  changes shape  and  volume as  I move  my  body  around. We  work together to shape  the house  as we go. Even our  breath affects the architecture as it  contracts and  expands like  an  organism around  us.  “Having  once begun  to architect their surroundings,  human  beings never stop. A  person turns  a desert or a forest into  an architectural surround  by how she moves through  it.  Advancing  and cutting  paths, fending for herself and defending herself, she uses her limbs to erect enclosures or break them,” says Madeline Gins (Gins and Arakawa 2002: 44).
