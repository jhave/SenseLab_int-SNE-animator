↓ The next  day  I meet  him  at the broken-down camper-vans at the other  end  of the  track.  We talk  about  architecture. Doug  is an architecture freak,  and  he has gone around the world to visit historic  homes  of architects. I ask him if he knows Arakawa  &  Gins,   which   he   doesn’t.    I  tell   him   that   they   were   building architecture to defy  death. They  wanted architecture to continuously challenge the  body,   to  invite   its  inhabitants  to  never   stop   exploring  the  relationship between body  and  the  environment. “Running is a  bit  like  this,”  Doug  says. “Every   time   you   run   the   track   it’s   different.  You  will   become   intimately acquainted  with   every   little  inch  of  that   one  kilometer.  Did  you  notice   the laughing toads  at the  corner  there?  They  come  out  around 9pm.  And  the  fluffy pollen  trees  at the counting post  start  shedding their  offspring at sunset…. You notice  how  the  rhythms of your  body  blend  in with  the  subtle  rhythms of the environment. You  might  say  it’s  an  exercise  of accepting the  changes that  are taking  place within you.”
