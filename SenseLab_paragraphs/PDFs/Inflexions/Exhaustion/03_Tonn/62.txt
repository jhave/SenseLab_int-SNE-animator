↓ As an  act  of useful  procrastination I browse around, reading about  the  peat industry in The Netherlands. The development of the peat  industry carried prosperity  to  the   country  from   the   1100s  onwards,  and   around  1530  the accessible  peat  bogs  were  completely exhausted. This  resulted in  new technologies, such  as the  “baggerbeugel,” a dredging net  on  a long  pole,  that could  be used  to mine  the  harder-to-reach peat  below  water. The  muddy peat had  to be spread along  the narrow strips  of land  that  had  not been eroded by the peat  digging itself, and the workers pressed the water out by stamping on it with boards tied  to their  clogs. Today  this industry is inscribed into the land,  leaving large  areas  of the country looking  like broad-toothed combs  or land-sized Swiss cheese.  The digging escalated into  unmanageable proportions as entire  villages were at risk of eroding away  into the water.
