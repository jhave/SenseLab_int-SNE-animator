I picture large  fields  of prehistoric ferns  and  bright  red  berries  decomposing as they  are  folded into  an  alien  dune landscape with  inexplicable slowness. How they  make  space  for  themselves inside   these  folds,  and  how  their  exhales  of methane  gas   mould  pockets  pressing  lightly   against  the   salt   layer   of  the Zechstein.  The  time-spans that  are  instrumental to  geological formations are beyond human perception. The  rock  exposes  these  rhythms in comprehensible patterns of strata.  I recall  a visit  to  a quarry in  Germany in the  early  fall. My geologist friend  pointed to the stripes along the stone wall of the quarry hovering above  us. “Here  changes in the  tides  are  recorded! What  this  rock  shows  is the waxing and  waning of the moon.” I was  looking  at the large  drill  holes  into  the rock. They hinted at the rock’s not-so  distant future: It would eventually also be chopped into  sizable  blocks  of sandstone used  for buildings. Dinosaur-looking digging machines stood  dormant around a deep  pit of green  water, and the scent
