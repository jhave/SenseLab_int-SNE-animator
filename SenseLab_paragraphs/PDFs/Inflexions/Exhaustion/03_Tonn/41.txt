â†“ Some people in the Groningen gas fields wake  up  before  an earthquake is felt. They  cannot explain exactly  why,  but  they  believe  it might  be because of some extremely fine-tuned sensitivity to the pressure waves  preceding the vibrations. Not  unlike  birds  flying  low before  a storm,  or the dolphins beaching themselves before  a tsunami. The  dolphins in  Japan  cause  an  immediate wave  of anxiety among the  human population, evoking memories of destruction to come.  They lie  helpless on  the  beach,  drying out  in  the  sun,  aware of  their  own  act  of defiance.
