↓ I meet  Doug,  an American guy  in his 70s. He casually walks  the track  with  his friend  Abichal  and  the  two  of them  talk  almost  non-stop. Abichal  is part  of a religious  movement  that   believe   in  ultra-marathons  as  a  kind   of  spiritual awakening.  Doug   explains  how   he  started  his  life  as  a  runner  in   a  very prestigious race in New York in the 70’s. And that’s what  started the madness, he says  in  a  rather  self-deprecating voice.  Since  then   he  attended  more   ultra- marathons than  he can count.  There  was a Hungarian runner he always used  to run   next  to.  Her   name   was   Marina,  and   she  had   this   shining  bright  light emanating from her. “Even when Marina wasn’t running next to me, I could  still feel her presence,” he says.
