â†“ I am moving along the rows  of storage shelves  in the far end of the left corridor in the  core sample warehouse. My field  of vision  shoots  like an arrow towards the deep  dark  in the end  of the corridor. In rifle shooting it is called  the fate line: the piercing, penetrating, deadly gaze.  Try wider, softer.  Helping my gaze  with my  two  index  fingers  at the  periphery of each  eye I shift  my  gaze  outwards as much  as possible. This exercise is one of the small hidden gems of deconstructing the preconditioned sensory arrangements of the body.  As I move  deeper towards the darkness I notice  the rows  of storage shelves  moving with  the waves  of my gait.  A slight  shift  of attention and  the  whole  world becomes  animate with  a hidden movement. At the end  of the rows  in the darkness sits my orange tent.  I keep records of these exercises in the margins of newspaper cut-outs.
