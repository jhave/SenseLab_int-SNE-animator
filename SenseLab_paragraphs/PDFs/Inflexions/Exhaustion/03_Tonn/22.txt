Burial  History:  Unlike  human  burials, which   are  often  swift  and  procedural, burial  history of ancient organic matter is an ultra-slow folding process  of decomposition into  sedimentary layers.  It is continuous across  millennia as the earth  moves  and  overlaps like dough being  kneaded, over  time-spans too great to  understand.  As  I  move   along   the  rows   of  storage  shelves,   noting  them carefully through  each  corner  of  my  eyes,  I imagine the  entire  warehouse as sedimentary layers  of knowledge about  the subsurface of the earth.  The slowness of moving through the exercise brings  new details  of the archive  to the fore, such as the texture of the light as it is absorbed by dark  wooden boxes, or reflected by brightly yellow   storage units,   or  the  sharp smell  of  mould mixing   with   the chemical smell of resin.
