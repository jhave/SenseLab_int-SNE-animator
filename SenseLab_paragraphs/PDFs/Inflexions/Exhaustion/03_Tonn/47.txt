Rijn is one  of those  who  claim  to wake  up  before  an  earthquake is felt. As he drives me around the area, to proudly show  the work  he used  to do in the region during his years  as a civil engineer, he stops  at an old school. “Here  the children are  making earthquake alert  exercises,” he  says.  They  are  instructed to  hide under the tables  at the first sensation of an earthquake.” I recall the account of a friend  from   Japan:   If  you   live  within  an   earthquake  zone   a  subconscious anticipation of the next earthquake is always with  you.  The body  attuned to the vibrations it has learned entail danger.
