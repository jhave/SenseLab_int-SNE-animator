â†“ Geja lives close to the main  road  going  through the town.  In her ears, the crash of  an  earthquake can  be  mistaken for  a  big  truck   unloading stone  boulders outside her house.  She meticulously writes  down every  earthquake in a journal. I ask her to add  what  they  sound like. Other  people hear the falling  of chairs  from the second floor, or slamming of doors.
