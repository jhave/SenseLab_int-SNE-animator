blue  lines  create  a graphic representation of one  earthquake as sensed through different  accelerometers  across   the   landscape.  The   blue   graphs  show   the movement of  the  waves  emitted by  the  earthquake as  they  pass  through the earth.  This  should be  daily  research, but  itâ€™s  so awfully hard to  concentrate.  I attempt to respect the  solemn accuracy of the data  streams, but  I get distracted by  their  resemblance to  layers  of vertical  mountain landscapes. Ice peaks  and valleys  dramatically sweep across  the field, creating a body  of voluminous blue bursts that dissolve into dripping icicles along the perforated horizontal line.
