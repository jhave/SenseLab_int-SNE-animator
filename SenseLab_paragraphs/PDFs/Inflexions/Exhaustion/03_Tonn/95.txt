â†“ I am drawing a large map  along the storage shelves  in a remote walkway in the core  sample storage warehouse. It is stratified as layers  of encounters over  the last   year   and   a  half  of  research:  the   detailed  descriptions  of  the   different intensities  of   man-made  earthquakes  felt   in   the   bodies   of   the   people  in Slochteren.  They   are   perceiving  the   rhythms  of  different temporalities and indexing them  as gradations of experience. They  are  living  at the  forefront of a future of changes to come. They are unconsciously training their  bodies  to attune to  change. And  I draw the  voluntary exhaustion of the  monks and  the  ultra- runners and  their  altered sensory perceptions. They  are  challenging the  desert landscape within themselves by  examining every  grain  of their  being,  through excruciating and repetitive actions.  They are training the plasticity of their bodies and  of their  minds. Arakawa & Gins  wanted to create  architecture that  would reverse the destiny of a person. Defying  death is disjointing a linear  perception of time. They want  to infuse  the experience of living  with  new forms  of energy and new  forms  of  being  together. To  uncover a  virtual energy that  continuously expands as the body  realizes what  it can do.
