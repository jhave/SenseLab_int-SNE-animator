↓ Florence  is Geja’s friend.  She lives in a grand and stylish  villa off the main  road. She has a bit of an old-world kind  of glamour, and  speaks to me in perfect,  yet slightly   formal,   Danish. “The  experience of  earthquakes is  a  deep   primordial rumbling inside  the  gut—an elastic  expansion and  contraction of intestines, or cramps of the uterus,” she says. She looks at me alluding to a kind  of woman-to- woman secret of the effect of flooring menstrual cramps. I can’t help but imagine her delicate figure  trembling.
