Other  runners look like they  are basking in bliss. None  of them  stop  (except  one guy that dislocated his knee, who left the camp  at three  in the morning). They are mostly  crooked, old and  worn-out looking  bodies,  all slightly  leaning to the left (the helper of the suffering man  says that  this is because of the exhaustive state they’re in—the  right brain  half somehow shuts  off and they are mostly  guided by the left). The old are the ones that do best. One very tall lady with big legs, whom everybody calls Frau  Doktor, sleeps  one hour  every  night  for the entire  duration of the  race.  At any  other  time  she  just  walks,  with  a satisfied look  on  her  face. They all want  to meet the wall, the mental battle of the voices telling  them  to stop running. The winner of the race has run 750 km at the end of the 6th day. Each of them   stops  at  the  large  digital goal  table,  which   keeps  track  of  the  distance achieved by  each  participant.  Someone calls  the  goal  table  their  altar,  which seems ironically suitable, as runners drag  themselves into its flickering blue light at 4 o’clock in the morning.
