↓ I am  lying  on the  cold  concrete  floor.  I let my  fingers  run  across  the  wax  and grab  it  firmly  with  my  left  hand. It  is  a  grasp quite  unlike   that  of  touching another person, yet  doubtlessly with  some  kind  of hopeful intensity, probably akin to that  of handling a talisman or another magical  object. I focus on the hard surface  of the rock in an attempt to regain  my balance  and  fend  off the burst  of nausea that  hit me just minutes ago. I imagine its impenetrable, rocky  core and mentally induce its steadiness into my own dissident guts.  On the upper left side of my head  I feel this hot vibrating sensation, like a trace left on the inside  of my skull,   shaped  by   the   blow   of  a  city   bus   mirror.  A  strange  itch,   perhaps resembling the  feeling  of having a phantom limb—a  place  which  you  cannot scratch.
