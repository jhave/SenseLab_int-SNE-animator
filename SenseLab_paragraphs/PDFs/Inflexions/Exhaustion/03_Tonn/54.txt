↓ Geja’s brother used  to play  drums. He tells  me his dreams of making a score based  on  the  decades of  earthquake events,  where every  minute represents a year.   He  says  the  sound of  drum beats   condensing  the  earthquakes  into  a percussion symphony will make  people attentive to the earthquakes. The minute of 2014 would be like a thunderstorm of hands beating the drum skin. A year of sonic events  condensed into  one minute? His eyes are shining at the thought of it. If you sit still and  listen  to the sounds around you, how  many  of them  do you think  you perceive as what  they actually are?
