[1]  The  keeper  of  the  core  samples  at  times   lends   the  voice  of  the  French philosopher Henri  Bergson,  more  specifically his  last  work  The Two Sources of Morality  and Religion. His  lendings are  not  necessarily verbatim.  The  present remarks also  draw on  Suzanne  Guerlac’s  piece  “Bergson,  the  Void,  and   the Politics of Life.” See pages  40-60.
