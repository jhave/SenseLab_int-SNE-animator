↓ It  is  an  oddly shaped rock  wrapped in  tinfoil  and  twine,  then  enclosed in orange wax. Hiding for years  on the dark  shelves  in a corner  of the core sample storage warehouse,  a  fine  layer  of  dust   testifies   that   no  human hands have touched it for a long time. Moist pebbles are trapped inside  the skin-like  layer  of wax.  At  a glimpse of the  eye,  the  core  sample looks  like  a piece  of meat  at  a butcher’s shop.
