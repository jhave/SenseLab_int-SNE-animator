surface.  DR  is an  archive of  simple  practices intended  to  keep  track  of  these recordings. I tell myself  that  the earthquake came  for a reason.  It will inscribe  a new  kind  of sensory attunement into  my  body  that  will  help  amplify minute graduations of change. Drying off the  hot  white  foam,  noticing the  trembling muscles and the flickering gaze. It will be a matter of survival.
