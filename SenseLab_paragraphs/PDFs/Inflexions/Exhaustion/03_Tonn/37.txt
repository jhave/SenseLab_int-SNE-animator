↓ Through vibrating waves  the digestive tract  becomes  connected to the drilling head  exploring and  perforating the substrata, breaking open  new  reservoirs. Gas slips  up  to the  surface,  emptying these  pockets inside  the  earth.  The sinking of the   earth   above   sends   ripples  through  the   layers   of   strata.    This   energy accumulated across millennia gains magnitude and power as sound waves  ripple through the  earth.  The  ripples penetrate any  kind  of  matter – bricks,  church walls,  dikes,  garden paths and  human organs. The magnitude of an earthquake is archived as different intensities felt as vibration inside  the  gut.  An embodied library  of earthquakes.
