â†“ One  man  has  so many  blisters  that  he is moaning at every  step  he takes.  He yells a great  deal  at his helper, a large  unbelievably patient man,  and  his face is constantly wrenched into  an  agonized grimace. I wonder what  on  earth  drives him forward in what  must  surely  be an internalized purgatory. On the last day  I give him  two  painkillers, and  he seems  truly  grateful. He says I do  not  want  to see his feet, as all his toenails have  fallen  off. I look at his cut-up running shoes and  agree,  repulsed by the thought of the  nailless  bloody toes  below  the  socks.
