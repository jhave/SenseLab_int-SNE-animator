Peat  is the  accumulation of partially decayed organic matter, and  like the  core samples peat is a natural archive.  A fossilized record of changes over time, which manifests  in  vegetation,  pollen,   spores,  animals,  and   archaeological  remains found in the bog. Peat  is the first step  in the geological formation of other  fossil fuels  such  as coal and  gas.  Working in the  peat  fields  was  hard and  precarious labor, the archivist informs me. Peat workers stood  in cold water bending over to dig  out  heavy  mud for  16 hours a  day,  six  days  a  week  during season.   The exhaustive work  often led to illness and  death, and  usually the whole  family  had to participate in order to make  ends  meet.  The families  lived in temporary “plaggenhutten,” self-built   seasonal huts  made   from  sods.  The  ground which they  stood  on  was  rented out  to  the  peat  workers by  their  employer, which imposed strict  rules  upon the renters (such  as no peat  digging on their  own  plot of land).
