The keeper forms  his hands in the air. He gestures the shapes of gas reservoirs. Pulsating movements, like  palpitating hearts, pushing air  out  from  inside  the palms.  When  the  gas  reservoirs are  empty they  deflate  like  rock  balloons and send  tremors across  the surface  of the earth.  His usual demeanor of professional reservedness seems somewhat deflated too. His movements now  emanate a tired precision, like that  of a worn  out craftsman that  shaped hard metals  for decades, or perhaps a tarot  reader that knows too much.
