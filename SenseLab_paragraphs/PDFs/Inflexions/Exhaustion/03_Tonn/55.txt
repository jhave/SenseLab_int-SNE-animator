↓  Still  nauseous from  the  exertion of  the  walk   I  lay  down to  do  an  online meditation practice in the bedroom of Geja’s grandchildren. The instructor asks me to classify sounds starting with  the one furthest away,  going  closer and  closer until   I  end   up   at  my   own   breath.  The  exercise   is  a  practice  of  precisely cataloguing the  layers  of sound that  exist  around me,  constantly changing and re-positioning with the movements of my body.  In the end, he instructor asks me to listen  to my  heart.  As I lay  there  trying my  best  to listen  to the  beats  of my heart  I wonder if the presence of man-made earthquakes could  create  a finer attunement to sound. If this attunement would even be passed down to the next generation, then  the  population living  with  earthquakes can  evolve  into  more sensitive beings,  aware of the  possibility of volatile  change imposed by a man- made  ecology.
