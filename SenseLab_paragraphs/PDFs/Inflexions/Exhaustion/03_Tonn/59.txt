↓ There was an earthquake while  I was in Slochteren, but I didn’t feel it. I look at the  list  of  data   that   the  seismometers  have   picked  up   across   the  province, irritated at  their  precise   sensitivity. The  seismometer acts  like  extended ears dangling deep  in shafts  dug  into the earth.  These mechanical ears pick up  every little vibration of the earth,  and  they transfer them  into data  points along  a wave form  on the screen.  The data  shows  no signs  of anxiety.  The seismometers don’t pass  judgement on the origin  of the source,  which  can be a natural as well  as a man-made  earthquake,  or   something  completely  different,  like   a  jet  plane breaking the sound wall above ground.
