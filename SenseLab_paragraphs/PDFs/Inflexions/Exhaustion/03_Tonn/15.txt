↓ A yellow  note enclosed in the wax of the core sample states  that  it is Slochteren Sandstone, taken  in the town  by the same name  in the 1950s. It is carrying deeply desirable information  about   the  earth,   of  dreams about   unexplored treasures hidden just below  our feet. The triumphant circumvention of the impenetrability of the surface  of the earth.  Perhaps it was even the sample that  would determine the  first  drilling for  gas  in  Slochteren more  than  60 years  ago.  As  I hold  the sample in my hand I feel a subtle  vibration. The tremors are ever  so soft, at the threshold of  perception—phantom vibrations or  poltergeist  vibrations, which make   me  question my  own  state  of  mind. I  remember  a  quote   by  William Burroughs in the  essay  about  the  practice of Do Easy—Every  object you touch is alive with your life and your will (Borroughs 1979: 60). But elsewhere in the  same essay  he states  that  objects might  jump  out  and  stump against your  toe or slam against your  knuckle, so I guess  it’s not as simple  as that.
