↓ Johan  lives in an old farmhouse at the end  of a winding unpaved road,  which doesn’t  show  up  on Google  Maps.  The sounds of the landscape are uncrowded, making each one stand out. Well-fed,  prize  worthy chickens  shriek  as he throws a  load  of  grains   at  them.   The  well  shrieks too,  as  he  hauls   water from  the underground. He shows  me the cracks  in his house  that  haven’t  been  fixed  yet. There  is a large  crack in the red  brick wall  at the base of the house,  which  looks like failed  attempts at burning ceramics. “A hurricane suddenly emerges from  a clear sky and  swoosh, shakes  the entire  house  so bricks  and  mortar is crackling and  windows are  shivering,” Johan  gestures, with  his  arms  flowing above  his head.  He grabs  the  iron  on the  stove  and  rattles  it back  and  forth.  He does  the same thing  with the TV set. The sound breaks  the pristine silence.
