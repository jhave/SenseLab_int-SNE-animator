looks more  like a ghost,  wearing an oversized dark  coat and  a felt hat. He points to a large  poster, showing the layered strata  of the Groningen Gas Field and  the empty holes  that  illustrate the  gas  reservoirs. “Energy is never  only  extracted from  the  ground. It  is  also  extracted from  our  bodies.   It  manifests through sensory exhaustion from bodies  having to continually adapt to volatile  and  rapid changes within the  environment. The  void  is created in  humans because they have not evolved to perceive these  rhythms of past  times that  pass through ours. The void can only be filled through a realization of this relationship: The tapping of the  earth’s  energy, and  the  mutual exhaustion of our  bodies  are  connected, even  if the exhaustion shows  itself through other  aspects of our  lives.”  With  the purposeful, slow movements of a soothsayer he hovers his hands across a pair of fine-grained cores  of gravel.  “We  have  consumed so much  past  time,  fossilized into  reserves of  oil,  gas  and  coal  buried deep   in  the  ground, that  it  is  now impossible to feel grounded in the  present. We have  entered into  an  addiction with  past  time  preserved as fossils, and  that  is clouding our  connection with  the future.” [2]
