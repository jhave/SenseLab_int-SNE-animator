↓ I sift through the  footage  I shot  at a demonstration at a gas  plant  in Delftzij. Young  anarchists are  meeting up  with  mostly   elderly locals  who  have  been affected  by the earthquakes. A guy in a black hoodie is blasting Rammstein from a large  boom  box and  the many  homemade signs  are hovering in the wind.  The diverse group battles  the  wind  as they  tie a 20-metre  large  banner to the  barb- wire  fence.  In  large  black  letters  it  reads,   “Together we  are  shutting the  gas valve.”  I meet  a lady  with  a bright green  hat with  the words “Groninger Bodem Beweging” (Groninger Ground Movement) written across  the  cap.  She tells me about  her  small  personal acts of activism. She frequently emails  the  companies with  far-fetched requests, such  as if they  could  provide her with  a life-vest  and  a lifeboat.   She  lives  close  to  the  dikes  and  her  argument is,  that  if  they  burst because of earthquakes she would surely  need  a lifeboat.  The company’s lawyers will   then   spend  weeks   constructing  an  argument  as  to  why   they   are   not responsible for  buying her  the  requested lifeboat.  She also  has  an  unexpected alliance  with  the  local  bank,  calculating their  losses  incurred as  property value drops below  the  mortgage loans  for  the  houses in  the  area,  trying to  advocate within the  structures of the  financial system.  We are  sitting  on the  dyke  eating soup,  watching the wind  tear at the large banner.
