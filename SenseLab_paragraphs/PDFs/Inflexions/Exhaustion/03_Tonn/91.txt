“The   house   is  a  tool—a   procedural  tool.   It  is  a  means   for  examining  the sensorium. With  this  tool  you  may  explore  ways  of reconfiguring the  synaptic connections formed in the  brain  from  a lifetime  of living  in static  architecture. Never  be so damn sure  of yourself.” I hear  Madeline’s voice echo. As I continue to  adapt with  and  through this  environment I too  start  to  change. The  dream spans over  millennia. I become  more  aware of  the  changes and  shifts  in  the perceptual  posture  of  my  body,   as  I  am  reborn  into  new   generations, and eventually I start  to notice with  precision how it interacts with  the surroundings. While  constantly having to hold  and  mould the  house  is exhausting at times  I notice my body  becoming accustomed to perceiving even the subtlest of changes. We move with the weather.
