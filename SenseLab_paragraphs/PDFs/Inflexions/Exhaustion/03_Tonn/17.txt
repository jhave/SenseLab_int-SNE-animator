↓ The keeper of the core sample warehouse handles the long cylindrical canisters with  delicate precision, but  without particular affection.  He  has  let  me  set  up shop  in the back of the long corridors, overbearingly tolerating my newfound obsession.  Like  a  good   archivist  he  knows  the  shelves   in  the  deep   of  the warehouse like the  palm  of his hand, and  he patiently pulls  out  every  mouldy wooden box I point  at. His movements are precise,  and seem to be reduced to the bare  minimum of effort.  He  moves  with  ease,  and  a surprising strength for his small  figure,  when he  pulls  out  the  long  boxes  full  of resin-enclosed Limburg sandstone. Secretly I wonder if he feels the dead presence of the rock samples too closely,  and  if blasting loud  talk  radio  from  his office is a way  of muting their silence. Apart from the daily  management of the core samples coming  in and  out from  the field, he is also in charge  of an impressive collection  of succulents that reach  their  bony  branches towards the  ceiling.  We stay  largely  uninterested in each  other’s  Daily  Research,  both  hiding behind the  clear  corners of the  neatly organized storage shelves.
