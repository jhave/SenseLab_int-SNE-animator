â†“  Before  the   companies started  drilling  into   the   earth   they   took   mile-long biopsies  of  the   subsurface.  These   biopsies  were   meticulously  examined  by equipment so accurate that  it could  predict the day-to-day growth of a cancerous tumor. The size of the grains  of sand  was  noted, and  through a microscope they turned into  fist-sized gems.  When  the  right  constellation of  sedimentary rock was found they  cheered. A law was passed that  all samples taken  in the country should be stored in the Core Sample  Storage  Warehouse. They are brought to the warehouse in  carefully wrapped  plastic  canisters, where they  find  their  final resting place  inside  one  of the  layers  of storage shelves.  Some  rocks  are  black with  glistering white  arteries, some  damp and  dusty, several  stored in old  and mouldy wooden boxes.  Salt  cores  are  leaking   with  moisture, perforating the brittle  cloth enclosing them  with patterns of crystals.
