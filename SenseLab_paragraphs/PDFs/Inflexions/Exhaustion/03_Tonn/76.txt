â†“ The  track  that  is used  for  the  race  is 1 km  round and  located  on  a shabby camping ground at the edge of the turquoise Balaton lake. The place is like an ant colony  buzzing with  organizers, runners and  their  helpers handing them  drinks and  fancy protein snacks  that  they stack inside  little white  huts  along  the track. I spend six days  looking  at the runners as they  make  their  way  round and  round the track.  Again  I have  to come to terms  with  the feeling  of being  an imposter. I try  to  focus  on  my  own  Daily  Research.  I notice  their  faces  slide  by,  and  the different gradations of exhaustion and  agony  in their  eyes.  I smile  at them  and give  them  encouraging cheers  during the  day.  At night  I hide  behind the  dark and watch  voyeuristically.
