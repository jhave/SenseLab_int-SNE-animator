↓ Attunement etymologically means  to  bring  into  a harmonious or  responsive relationship. Attuning one’s  body  (in  a harmonious way)  to  a  world of  man- made   earthquakes seems   like  a  daunting task.  The  lady   in  the  green   hat  is working “in spite  of” it all. Her actions  are like tiny pebbles in the shoes  of those who have the means  to drill in the underground near the dykes  by her house.
