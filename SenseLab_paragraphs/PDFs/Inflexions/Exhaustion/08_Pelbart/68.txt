Maybe  we have to consider exhaustion at the heart  of this existential intersection, micro-  and  macropolitical, biopolitical. Does  exhaustion signify  the  end  of the world, or the end  of a certain  world we have  to leave  behind? Is exhaustion the sign of the end of the subject, or of a certain  subjectivation? Of a desubjectivation, or a certain  desubjectivation? Is it mortifying or vital?  Black hole or opening? At the  point  where we are, it would be necessary to speak  of Nietzsche’s nihilism, with  all its proper ambivalences: one doesn’t  have to defend oneself  in regards to nihilism, but has to traverse it, take it to the end to open up a new horizon. As long as this  shift  is not  reached (destruction/creation), the  untying is uncertain. The same goes for exhaustion.
