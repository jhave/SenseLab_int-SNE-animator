“that  boy,”  one already produces identity. How  can one allow  the individual to exist  without imposing the  He,  the  Subject,  the  Him,  that  whole  series  that  we ascribe to individuals? Deligny  is convinced that we stand before an individual in rupture of the subject.  Through the empire of language, we always feel impelled to convey  order-words and  to emit signs. In this way, we create an Inside  of communication, signals,   signs,  and   language. Deligny   maintains that  autistic people aren’t Inside that circle, and the question is not about sticking them in there. One could  say that  Deligny  is prejudiced against language as bearer  of meaning, finality,  project,  output. Autism, at the opposite end  of language, allows  for the evacuation of finality, its tyranny. The strength of that idea is remarkable: art is for nothing, and politics  makes  projects; here too, art would place itself at the level of “for nothing.” What  is always in question for Deligny  is not  the Whole,  but  the rest.… Power  wants the Whole, it gets exasperated, it makes  inventories of being and  having, of  the  yes  and  the  no,  while  Deligny   thinks for  the  elusive,   the refractory, in a “milieu” that only just allows  one to exist.
