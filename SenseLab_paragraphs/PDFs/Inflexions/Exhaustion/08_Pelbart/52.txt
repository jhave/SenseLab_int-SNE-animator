Christoph Schlingensief, who was looking  for actors for his production of an Opera Ghost Train in São Paulo and wanted to meet our company to see whether we’d be a good  fit, whether he had  ever made  love to a corpse.  Schlingensief immediately hired  us—this degree of unmediated presence is exactly  what  he needed for his piece.
