I can’t deny  that  twenty years  ago, at the beginning of that  theatrical experience, when I  considered  myself   the  “coordinator”  (a  sort   of  1  together  with   the directors), I had  an  active  presence. In recent  years  I started to retire  from  that function, or I was gradually removed from it. It could  now circulate, pulverize, or simply self-dilute, in favour of a more  mobile  or dissolute composition. This n-1 operation corresponded to a kind  of desubjectivation, where we abandon the identity cloak  which  had  identified us.  Perhaps this  is a  condition for  a  new collective  composition less centered on the Subject, on the I, on intersubjectivity, and  more  open  to  connections of a different order. Not  by  chance  one  of the strongest moments of the piece Quay of Sheep (later rechristened Sheep Chaos) was the  birth   of  an  enormous bundle  of  red  yarn   that   little  by  little  spread out connecting to all in an entanglement akin to the work  of Lygia Clark: mobile  and rhizomatic, formed by threads, bodies, and movements, like a collective body born of a thought.
