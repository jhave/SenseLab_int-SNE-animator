We had  lost many  things  along  the way: senses,  hierarchies, projects,  certainties, securities—including our director. Those may be the best moments to “think.” Not in order to think  an “object,” but to ask oneself: Why sustain a group such as this, which  experiments with  something of the order of the unliveable, perhaps of the useless,   and   through  which,   after   all,  one   tries   to  breathe  precisely  in  an unbreathable environment? Again,  Deligny:  for nothing, in order that  something may  erupt. Or  again  Deleuze: In  the  depth of  exhaustion, when nothing else remains, there arises the “pure image,” an intensity that stands “apart from words, stories,  and  memories, [and]  accumulates a fantastic potential energy, which  it detonates by dissipating itself.”  The philosopher adds:  “What  counts in the image is not  its meagre content, but  the energy—mad and  ready to explode” (Deleuze
1997: 160).
