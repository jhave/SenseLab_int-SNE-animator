At the end of 2016, we were invited to Amsterdam to present this piece at If I Can’t Dance I Don’t Want to Be Part of Your Revolution. Our ten-day stay was an adventure of incredible intensity thanks to the hospitality of our hosts,  the relationships we forged  with the welcome team and  other  artists,  and the entire  dynamic that such a trip  implies. The company had  been on several  tours  in the past:  in addition to traveling in Brazil, we went  to Finland, Scotland, Germany, France, and Portugal. Of  course,  the  excitement, the  emotion and  the  traveling itself  will  inevitably intensify certain  aspects of the supposedly most  banal  everyday nature: anxiety, stress,  fear, risks, possibly crises, collapse,  exhaustion, everything that constitutes the groundless ground that  we are facing  at every  moment in this project,  all the more  on  an  international tour.  Between  acceleration and  paralysis, success  and failure, presence and absence, always just about to flourish or implode. Everything happens at the edge of the abyss. We are used to it and, yet, we’re are living always on razor’s edge.
