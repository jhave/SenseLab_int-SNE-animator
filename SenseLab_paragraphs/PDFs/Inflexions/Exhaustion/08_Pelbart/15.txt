The extent  to which  all of this  fascinated me isn’t surprising given  the  years  of experience amid  the Ueinzz  Theatre Company. For better  or for worse,  some  of these  traces  were  present, despite the  schizophrenic world being  very  different from the autistic world, beginning with the presence of language in the former, if somewhat subverted, derailed, decoded. But  it was  also  important for  us  that language  didn’t  convey    order-words,  that    we   didn’t  submit  to   a   blind productivity, to a capitalization of existence,  and  that  we remained at the level of the  “tentative,” the  raft,  the  open,   in  order to  give  way  to  the  inadvertent, irruption, gestures, following the  erratic  (wander) lines.  We can  even  sustain a temporary  finality—to put   together and  perform a  theatrical  piece—but that shouldn’t predetermine anything. The whole  challenge is to be at the service  of something we don’t know,  can’t anticipate or predict. We must  place ourselves in the present without hoping to “entertain” or “fulfil,” without the fear of “nothing happening”—the dreaded scene  of any  supervisor, animator, entertainer, businessman, cultural agent,  for whom everything always has to be filled in; the show  must  go on.
