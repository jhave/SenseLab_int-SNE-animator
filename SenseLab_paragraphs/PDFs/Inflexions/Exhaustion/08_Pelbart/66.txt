only option: he is the lunatic, the schizophrenic, the ill, in a minoritarian state and civil dependence, reterritorialized by the State, the family,  psychiatry, social insurance. Desubjectified, subjectified, deterritorialized, reterritorialized. And yet, throughout the years together he could demonstrate an important inversion in two directions. On the  one hand, his desubjectivation touched upon a nomadic drift (d√©rive), where erring  became  an  exploitation of worlds, of affects,  of uncoded connections. At  the  same  time,  a  kind   of  heretic   subjectivation  took  off:  the anarchist emperor, the stubborn challenging of consensus, the different modes of performative desertion.
