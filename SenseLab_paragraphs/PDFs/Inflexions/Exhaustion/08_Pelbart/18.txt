Some  years  ago  we  were  invited into  a  joint  project  by  the  artistic/political collectives   mollecular.org  from  Finland and   presqueruines from  France.   The project consisted of crossing the Atlantic on a cruise from Lisbon to Santos, where we  were  supposed to  put  together and  perform a  piece  inspired by  Kafka’s Amerika, as well as to make a film. A luxurious cruiseliner conceived for unending consumption, uninterrupted entertainment, and continuous feasting  left no space for  anything:  mental, psychic,  physical saturation, a pleasure-seeking semiotic bombardment where nothing, precisely, could  “happen.” There  was  no way  to create  one’s own  space,  to subtract oneself  from  the  cruise’s  frenetic  rhythm in order to put  together a theatrical piece  amid  the  interminable programme and infinity on offer. As Deleuze would say, the possible has been exhausted.
