As Erika has expressed, this reasonably connected prologue gives the spectator the illusion  of a cohesive  narrative, which  frees him to enjoy what  will come without worrying about  “understanding” anything, since there  is nothing to understand. This is where the true  theatrical adventure begins,  when one lets go of comprehension in order to enter another sphere, a mode  of affectation, of multiple worlds and multiple times.
