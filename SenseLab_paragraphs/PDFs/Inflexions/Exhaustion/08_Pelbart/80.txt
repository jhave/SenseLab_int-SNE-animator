possible futures. We are not the “new  people.” Yet, our delayed experimentation necessarily echoes many  others  from the homeless of our megalopolises to the yanomami spirit  xapiris. Each  on  its  own  singular scale,  however small,  time, however derailed, and  its happenings, however minuscule, compose a minor inhabitation. Nomadic and uncertain, as fragile in the face of the world’s economy and strong in sustaining that fragility, making a body out of each voice that affects it, with each gesture that reaches  it, composing with each dissonance.
