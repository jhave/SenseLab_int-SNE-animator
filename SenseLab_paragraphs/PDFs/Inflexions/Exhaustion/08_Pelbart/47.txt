of  disobedience, the  lust  of  insubordination, nudity  and  shame, desire  and  the sublime sins, murder and  sacrilege,  punishment and escape,  heresy  and delight. And they realized that the Earth was not only  inhabited by  man  and  woman. There  were  Gay  Adams and Lesbian   Eves,   Bisexuals,   Transexuals,  Transgenders, Countersexuals, there  were  all sorts.  And  just as the  world wasn’t divided only  between  men   and   women, it  also  wasn’t   divided between the mad  and  the sane, the good  and  the bad, the quick  and the fast, black and white, intelligent and dim, modern and primitive, brutal and  sensitive, São  Paulo  fans  and  Corinthians fans.  Deep down, everything was  a lot more  mixed  up  than  what  he had  led them   to  believe.   They  also  discovered that   not  only  Earth   was inhabited and  inhabitable. They felt free to search  for other  planets, to build  powerful spaceships, to cross the universe from one end to the other.  And  they discovered that  not only this universe exists. So they  started visiting other  worlds, parallel worlds, virtual worlds, impossible worlds, incompossible worlds. And  they  started seeing other   gods   which   are   less  vain   or  vengeful  or  exclusive  than Abraham’s God,  Greek  gods,  Roman  gods,  Indian gods,  Egyptian gods,  tupiniquim deities,  yanomami entities.  And  they  envisioned many  other  spirits  roaming their  surroundings. Minute, luminous, shimmering beings  with  small  dicks  would fall from  the  sky  like silver  rain,  dancing gaily  around them,  once  more  populating the world and  helping them  to heal the sick. Men discovered that  even though banished from  Paradise, or  precisely because of that,  they were  capable  of multiple ecstasies  and  delightful mysteries, unutterable crimes  and  numinous solidarities, zero  gravity and sidereal joys.
