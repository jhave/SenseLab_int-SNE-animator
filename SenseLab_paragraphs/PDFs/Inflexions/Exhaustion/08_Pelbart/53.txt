Alexandre played several  roles  throughout the  pieces  we  made.  The  first  was Artaud’s anarchist emperor, inspired by Elagabalus; the last was the role of Cesar, crushed by  his  mother. On  stage,  he  led  touching dialogues, gave  enthusiastic monologues or bizarre exhortations (“What  you need is sex,” he threw in the faces of a perplexed Finnish  audience). Occasionally, he would simply wander the stage in silence, with  a lowered head  and  curved back that  seemed to carry  the weight of the  world, and  you’d  know  that  in his head  all the voices  of the planet were confronting each other  in an unforgiving battle. He repeatedly said that art didn’t comfort  him.
