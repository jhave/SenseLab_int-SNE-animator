In 2013 the opportunity arrived to present a project for a cultural institution. It was a chance  to get more  consistent financial support for the first time in many  years. For a whole  year, it would allow actors to receive  monthly payment. We thought of elaborating on a project inspired by Deligny.  On a previous trip to France I had visited the  archive  of the  Institut Mémoires de l’édition  contemporaine (IMEC), situated at  the  Abbaye   d’Ardenne  in  France,  where I researched the correspondence between Deligny  and  Guattari. I found fifty-seven letters  from Deligny,  and  only one answer from Guattari (the others  are not in the archive).  I was quite  surprised when I came upon a sketch,  in one of the letters,  of a theatre piece or film that  Deligny  planned to set up. At the time Guattari had  a house  in Saint-Étienne-de-Gourgas made  available to all sorts  of collective  initiatives and projects. Deligny’s script described a situation in which  there are more actors than roles in a troupe. That  is, there  wouldn’t be enough costumes for all. Divided in two groups, the Gours  and the Gasses, the Gours  were those who were able to get into the skin of a character, and the Gasses “those  who are capable  of nothing: not even (to be) a character, nor a policeman, nor a thief, nor a priest,  nor a prisoner… nor man, nor woman: afflicted souls, individuals who, without having entered the skin of a subject,  are left with  no project,  they  are redundant, they’re worse  than nothing, worse  than  the  mob.”  Hence,  the Gours  rehearse while  the  Gasses  err, idly,  in discontent. But all those  who  were  Gours  at one point  will eventually be Gasses.
