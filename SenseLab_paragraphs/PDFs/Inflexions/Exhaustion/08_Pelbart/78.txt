The  autochtonous  peoples of  the  American  continent—the collectives  of humans and  non-humans whose  history dates  back to millennia before  their  collision  with  planet Commodity—are only a small part of contemporary Terran Resistance, this broad clandestine movement that  has  only  begun to make  itself visible  in the  planet occupied by the  Moderns: in Africa,  Australasia, Mongolia, in the backstreets and  basement of Fortress Europe. They are not really  in a position to lead any final combats or cosmopolitical Armageddons; it would be ridiculous to picture them as the seed of a new Majority. Above  all, we should not expect  that,  if they  could,  they  would run to  the  rescue   of  Humans, to  redeem or  justify  those   who  have persecuted them  implacably for five centuries … one thing  is for certain:  Amerindian collectives,  with their comparatively simple technologies that  are nonetheless open  to high-intensity syncretic assemblages, are a “figuration of the future” (Kroijer 2010), not a remnant of the past. Masters of the  technoprimitivist  bricolage and politico-metaphysical metamorphosis, they  are  one  of the  possible chances,  in fact, of a subsistence of the future. To speak  of the end  of the world is to speak of the need to imagine, rather than a new world to replace  our  present one, a new  people, the people that are missing. A people who  believes  in the world that  it will have  to create  with whatever world we will have left them.  (Danowski and  Viveiros  de Castro  2017: 120-123)
