to “merchandise illness”),  then  to instantly attribute a bizarre diagnostic (“spatialitis” or “infinititis”) and place a helmet  filled with wires and electrodes on the  sufferer’s  heart   as  in  shock  therapy. But  on  that  planet, instead of  shock therapy,  each  patient  received a  shamanic treatment  based   on  contact   with luminous stones,  gestures, and magical  words, ultimately from indigenous languages. In one of the performances I was a sick person. When asked  who I was, I quite  suddenly came up with  the answer, “God.” And  what’s your  sickness?  “I am losing my powers.” They tried  to heal me, but in vain. God died.  “God is long gone,”  they ascertained.
