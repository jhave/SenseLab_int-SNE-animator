Our era revolves around this pathology: market-ready modes of existence.  Part of the   contemporary  effort   is  to  diagnose  this   illness   and   retrace   its  genesis, ramifications, and effects. Among them  is the daily  rejection  of “minor” modes of life  that   are  not  only  more   fragile,   precarious,  and   vulnerable  (poor,   crazy, autistic), but  also  more  hesitant, dissident, and  at  times  more  traditional than others  (Indigenous people);  that  are,  on the  contrary, still being  born,  tentative, even experimental (to be discovered, invented). There is a war  between different modes of life or forms of life today. Perhaps this is what  has led some philosophers recently to dwell  on  such  atypical modes of existence,  even  if they  pertain to a bygone era:  the  Franciscans in  Agamben, the  Cynics  in  Michel  Foucault, the schizos in Gilles Deleuze-Félix Guattari, the autistic in Ferdinand Deligny,  but also the Araweté in Eduardo Viveiros  de Castro  or even the fireflies in Georges  Didi- Huberman. This is the zigzagging line of inquiry that in the last decades has been crossing the  philosophical, anthropological, subjective,  and  aesthetic domains, challenging our political  imagination.
