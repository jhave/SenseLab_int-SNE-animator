The initial synopsis of that last theatrical piece was: “There  isn’t enough space for all people in the  world. Some  people live in limbo,  between walls,  others  were thrown into  the  sea.  A small  group decides to board a ship  in search  of other worlds, of possibles, zero gravity… Utopia, evasion or lucidity?”
