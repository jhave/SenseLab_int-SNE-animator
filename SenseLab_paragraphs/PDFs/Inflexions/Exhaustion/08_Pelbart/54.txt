From the beginning of our trip  to Amsterdam, he was very  distressed, certain  of an imminent catastrophe in his life. He kept  repeating the word “passage.” Was he referring to his father  who  was already old and  whose  death he expected? Or to himself?  Or to our  trip?  We stayed very  close to him  during our  time  in the Netherlands but he already seemed to be exhausted beyond repair: he saw no way out. In the Van Gogh Museum, he let out a terrible scream that mobilized the entire security team  of the museum from which  he was immediately barred. Van Gogh would have  handled the  situation  differently, had   he  been  there.   Alexandre refused the  life of the  museum, life in the  museum, museumized life, artefacts made   to   suffocate  life.  His   solitude  was   enormous,  even   though  he   was surrounded  by  a  group  of  people  that   he  kept   mobilizing  day   and   night, affectively, concretely.
