as politicians and  militants claim  to do.  No,  this  kind  of talk  irritated him.  He needed to make his entire  body  heard, his body which  always thought so hard, to sound out a cry like “God is a machine” and slam his fist on the table to finally say what  he thought of computers, of the 0s and  the 1s. He needed things  to resonate as they  certainly resonated inside  him.”  Again  Alexandra Riera: “In the end, Alexandre  only  spoke   politically and   poetically  in  the  sense   of  escaping  all established frameworks. He seemed very concerned by everything going on in the world and at the same time didn’t let anybody structure his thoughts or his speech, nothing. His character was destructive in a nonviolent way, for he was a destroyer of false illusions, false promises, false political  speech,  declarations of love or else. He was a very subtle,  reserved person in the end.”
