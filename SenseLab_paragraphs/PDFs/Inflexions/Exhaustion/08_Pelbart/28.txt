After  the abovementioned cruise,  we felt disorientated, estranged in the absence of our director. Between abandonment and relief we literally jumped from the ship onto  the raft. From  the project  to the tentative. From  the monocratic direction to sustained anarchy. The idea  was  not to substitute the director, to fill in the void and put together what was left in fragments, but to navigate this new chaos, where the  most  disparate voices  met  with  grumblings about  the  need  for a conductor. Amid ideas for outrageous pieces someone would ask if the group would end. The shipwreck feeling materialized in a subsequent piece, where a ship in angry waters tumbles and  all aboard are launched into the sea. However, in the sequence they wake  up as sheep  bleating helplessly.
