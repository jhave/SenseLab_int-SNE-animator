So we  decided to promise to  make  a piece  inspired by  Deligny.  We added an additional event  in which  his editor Sandra Álvarez de Toledo  projected films by or  about  Deligny. There  was  an  exhibition with  several  maps  produced by  his collaborators throughout the years,  and  a parallel publication of one of his books (The Arachnean, by n-1 publications)—in other words, a sort of Deligny  occupation. Finally, the project was approved.
