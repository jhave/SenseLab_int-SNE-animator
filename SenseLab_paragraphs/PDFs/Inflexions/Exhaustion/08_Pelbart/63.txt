Should one consider these  lives as bare  life? Without a doubt, from  the point  of view of power, here we find these lives susceptible of being  killed without it constituting a crime, in a state of exception that is “scientifically legitimated.” However, if we  refuse  starting from  bare  life in  order to  think  biopower, and follow  Muriel  Combes  suggestion in a Foucauldian and  Simondonian line,  it is rather about  thinking these lives through the notion of “lives  capable  of conduct” (conduite)—from here  a totally  different horizon opens  up.  Even  in the concentration camp  but  similarly in the  most  delicate contexts  of our  time,  it’s about  our lunatics, Deligny’s autists, the Bartlebys  being a little bit everywhere, or even the anonymous of the protests in Brazil in 2013, it’s always about the gestures, manners, modes, variations, resistances that are molecular and multitudinous.
