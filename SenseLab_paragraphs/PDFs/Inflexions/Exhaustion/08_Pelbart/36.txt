The idea that  there  are more  people than  roles seemed to me frighteningly strong and simple.  Isn’t it what  we see all the time around every corner, whether we think of the distribution of wealth, jobs, or natural resources in a city or in the world at large? One part  of the population is expendable; it’s useless  even to serve,  and  in those  extreme situations must  be exterminated. When  Lazzarato writes  that  the artistic   act  becomes   resistance as  long  as  there   is  transversality  between the molecular action  of rupture and  composition in a specific domain and  in macropolitical domains, we  can’t  help  but  agree  and  situate ourselves on  that horizon where the  micro  and  macro  resonate (2014: 15-16). As Guattari asks  in another context:  “Will the revolution that  is coming  elaborate its principles from something said by Lautréamont, Kafka or Joyce?” (Guattari 2015: 275) We would add:  from  something stated in Deligny’s script,  by the unreasonable, foolish,  by the schizo or the autistic, or even by the diverse devices  capable  of giving  them  a voice?
