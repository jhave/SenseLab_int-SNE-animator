It is the  Catalonian psychoanalyst Tosquelles, master of a whole  generation of French  institutional psychiatry, in his book  Le vécu de la fin du monde dans la folie, who evoked situations of collapse  or illness felt as if nothing is possible, however, at  the  same   time,   everything  is  possible. Nothing  is  possible,  everything  is possible. Isn’t it strange that  we live in a similar  way  today, but  in a somewhat twisted sense? When everything seems possible (Arab spring, June 2013 in Brazil) the truth emerges: nothing is possible anymore (military or juridical coup  d’Etat, Donald Trump, Marine  Le Pen). When  the immoderation of power and  the excessiveness of pain  effectuate that  the formula “everything is possible” thus becomes  a horrible expression, since it means  that  it could  always be worse,  and, if “everything is possible” is equal  to “nothing is possible,” we feel that  the terms of this  game  deserve another configuration, or even  another chessboard that  we have to build  day by day.
