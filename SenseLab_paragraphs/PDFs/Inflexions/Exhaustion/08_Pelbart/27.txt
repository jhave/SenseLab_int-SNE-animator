Another  time   would  be  necessary,  a  time   not  pressed  by  urgency.  So  that something different might  occur which  isnâ€™t the mere realization of the previously established finality, be it sinister or progressive. Drifts, errors, erring  are necessary and  need  space  to occur. On the maps  that  Deligny  suggested to be drawn at the end  of each  day,  there  were  the  customary lines (habitual routes) and  the  wander lines (where something inadvertent had  happened, a new  gesture such  as a walk to a spring, a stop  by a specific point).  Nothing was induced or imposed: to accompany, not to drive.
