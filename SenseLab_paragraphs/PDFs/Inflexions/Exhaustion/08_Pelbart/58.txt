And  Pedro  França,  who  was assistant curator of the 2012 São Paulo  Biennale  but has since joined our company and became  Alexandre’s best friend  these last years, who  invited Alexandre to be his “assistant” during his art history classes, wrote: “For him, theatre was a way of being in the world. Stealing from a McDonald’s for the thrill  and  glamour, robbing an Itaú bank,  plundering the refrigerators of São Paulo’s  rich  neighbourhoods, maintaining silence  for minutes while  running in circles on stage,  pass  by the Praça  da Sé, that’s being  alive  in the world. That  is how  there  was  life, effectively,  where one  can touch  others  and  see the  stamps, passports and tickets dissolve. Over at the hospital’s emergency service, where we first found him [upright strapped to the bed], my friend maintained a kind of stage awareness … it was  monumental … in a way,  there  was  no difference between Dockzaal [where we performed in Amsterdam] and  the hospital, between the theatre, performance and  the people there,  between Herod and  Herodias. [3] Ale is  a  guy  who  effectively,   effectively, beyond any  cliché,  has  revealed the  line between art and  life, has destroyed all documents, attestations and  diplomas, has turned all forms inside out (forms of fashion, of rhetoric, theatre, gastronomy) and, I don’t know,  for me he’s a kind  of hero, in addition to being a great  friend.”
