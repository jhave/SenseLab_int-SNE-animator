Exhaustion is not mere tiredness, nor a renunciation of the body and mind but  rather, more  radically, it  is  the  fruit  of  a  disbelief,   an operation of disconnection. It consists  of unleashing the possibilities that  are presented to us relative to the alternatives that  surround us as well as the clichés that mediate and dampen our relation with the world in order to make  it tolerable. While  these  clichés  make  the world tolerable, because they  are  unreal, they  conversely end  up making the  world intolerable and  unworthy of belief.  Exhaustion undoes that which  “binds” us to the world, that “imprisons” us in it and  others,   that  “captures” us  with   its  words and   images,   that “comforts” us with an allusion of entirety (of I, of We, of meaning, of freedom, of the future) in which we have long ceased to believe, even as we have remained attached to them. There is, no doubt, in this act of separation, a certain  cruelty, which  is in no way  absent  from  the works  of Beckett  [who  inspired Deleuze to think  exhaustion], but this  cruelty  carries   within  itself  a  certain   pity   of  another  kind (Deleuze & Guattari 1987: 351-423). Only through such a negation of adherence, such an unfastening, such an emptying, together with the impossibility that  is established in this way, which  Deleuze calls “rarefaction” (as much  as he called for “vacuoles” of silence in order to be able, at least, to have  something to say) does  the necessity of something else arise, something which, with excessive pomp, we call “the  creation of the possible.” We should not  merely abandon this formula to the publicity experts, however; we should also avoid overloading it with  an excessively imperative or capricious incumbency, replete with  “will.”  Perhaps we  should preserve, as Beckett does, the trembling dimension which,  amidst the most calculated precision, in his  visual  poetry, point  to that  “indefinite state”  to which  beings  are elevated and  whose  correlative, even  in the  most  concrete  contexts,  is the  vagueness of becomings, at  the point  where they  achieve  their  effect of deterritorialization. If Zourabichvili is correct  in detecting “political chords” in The Exhausted, this  is because Deleuze himself  never  ceased  to extract such  chords from  the authors he analyzed, from  Melville  to Kafka,
