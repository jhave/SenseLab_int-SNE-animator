from  Lawrence to Ghérasim Luca. In the clinic, in art or in politics, there is a circuit that runs from the extenuation of the possible to the impossible, and  from  there  to the creation of the possible, without linearity, circularity or determinism. It consists  of a complex and reversible game  between “nothing is possible” and  “everything is possible.” (Pelbart 2015: 130-131)
