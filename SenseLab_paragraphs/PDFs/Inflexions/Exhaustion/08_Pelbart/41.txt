There  were  all sorts  of made-up planets. One of them  came up via Luiz, an actor that in the play repeated the word Klonoa, taken from a mobile phone game. It was suggested he follow a line stretched between apples thrown on the ground by the Eves. From that point  on he would turn  into the Klonoa planet, around which  the group would orbit. On another occasion,  the actor Onéss,  during a song, solitary, made  an encyclopaedic speech  on the birth of the stars. Paula read a Calvino story where a character repeated, “that  is not  to be explained.” Both fragments came together in a scene in which  Onéss  gave  a sort  of master class about  the birth  of the  stars.  To the  unanswered questions she  would respond:  “That  is not  to be explained.” That  scene  changed because Onéss  felt  assaulted by  her  comment since after all “everything has an explanation.”
