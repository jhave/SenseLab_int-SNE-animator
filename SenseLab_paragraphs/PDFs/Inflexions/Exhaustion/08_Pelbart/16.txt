As  La  Borde  director Jean  Oury   highlights, along   with   Guattari, that   is  the condition for something to happen—nothing “must” happen—since it’s precisely when something must  happen that  the most  impalpable happenings run  the risk of being aborted. In the end, what  is it really that matters? What can be seen? What is produced? What  takes  place  in the  interstices? What  lies in a state  of almost being? What escapes? What is lived in a state of exhaustion? And what  community is this  one,  which  doesn’t  necessarily produce theatrical pieces,  which  doesn’t necessarily need  to show  any  piece,  which  doesn’t  necessarily find  itself  in the piece it makes?
