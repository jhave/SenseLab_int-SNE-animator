trace  the  machinic ghosts  that  populate what  Guattari terms  an  ecology  of the phantasm. What  unites this  is a sense  of the  productivity of haunting by  such machinic ghosts,   their  faithlessness to  origins,   and  their  link  to  the  work   of pedagogy. In  the  series,   Claire   Parnet’s  relentless  smoking  just  offscreen   or reflected  in   the   mirror  behind  Deleuze  functions  as  such   a  disarticulated possession  of  Deleuze’s  heavy   cough   and   his  wasting.  The  cigarette  smoke wreathes Deleuze in an ectoplasmic haze that belongs entirely to the singularity of the encounter.
