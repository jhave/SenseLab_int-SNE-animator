A young boy turns on a television, which takes a while to warm up. He backs away to get a better  view  and  we lose sight  of the screen.  The image  cuts to black and white,  as a woman interviews a man  with  a stutter asking  him to give the details of his name  and  where he is from.  The  camera pans  over  to him  and  he  looks directly into the lens, he shares the information and a landscape of movement ticks and small gestures like tossing  his hair animate the scene. The camera tracks back to the woman and  she starts  to work  the space  between them,  using  gesture and touch  to create  a force field of influence between their  bodies.  On the plain  white wall behind them  we see the shadow of the microphone, a spectral, mute  witness anxiously absorbing the scene’s information. The woman redistributes corporeal and  mental energies, shifting tension from  mind to hands, and  then  releasing it; she tells him “you will speak loudly and clearly your whole life.” She puts her own voice  into  his body  in an  act of ventriloquism and  suspended will:  “say:  ‘I can speak’”!  He  repeats after  her  but  she  starts  to double his  words and  he  barely finishes  before the scene cuts to the title credits.
