With  the  work   of  the  stutter, the  rappings on  the  table  that   fail  to  entirely communicate, we open  onto an idea  of possession as a minor  practice in Deleuze and  Guattari’s sense.  In the abecedary, Deleuze retreads the initiating idea,  “A is for animal,” over  and  over  again,  in particular working through the  idea  of the analpha-bête, the undomesticated animal as that  whose  sense is illegible outside of relation and  contact,  who  deforms the  distinction entre chien et loup and  who invades friendship and familiarity with a dose of alterity.
