am not even  entirely sure  what  the object is; its untimeliness in many  forms  (the long duration, the curious pre-post mortem of its making, its irregular rhythms of episodes and  uneven individual letter  section,  and  its necessary detours into dialogues with  both  the historical moment of its production, and  with  the flurry of work  Deleuze and  Guattari made  at that  time)  makes  it unruly and  prone to fabulation (the technical expression of infidelity) in response to any attempt to pin down its truth value.  Thus in my own infidelity I have felt a kindred spirit  in this strange object. Deleuze himself  almost  instantly detours Parnet’s prompt in “F is for  Fidelity” into  a long  discussion of friendship as  an  experience of experimentation, full of comic timing and  radical distrust, and situated entre chien et loup (that twilight hour where form cedes to fabulation), and lastly, over the love of the délire, the break, and mark of madness. I set out to follow the breaks to move from the exhausting rigidity of fidelity  to the inexhaustible path  of detour in approaching this work, born out of a long philosophical friendship with Deleuze’s work  and the potentials it affords.
