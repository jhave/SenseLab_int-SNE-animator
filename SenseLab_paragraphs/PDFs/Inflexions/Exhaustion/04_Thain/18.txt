way kids think  the simple  act of covering their visible bodies  gives them  a kind  of spectral force. The pure  sheet of paper becomes  “pure spirit” and for a second we might   be  fooled   into  thinking of  the  elevated testimony of  the  philosopher, abstracted from  the body.  But no: in the speculative dimension of the “will have been,” Deleuze imagines himself as unruly spirit. “We have all done enough table turning/tipping  to  know   that   a  pure   spirit   is  not  someone  who   gives  very profound or very intelligent responses.”
