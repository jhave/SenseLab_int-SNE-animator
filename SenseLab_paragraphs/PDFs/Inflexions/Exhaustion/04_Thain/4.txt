This essay first emerged from a prompt to think  the television series Gilles Deleuze from A to Z (L’Abécédaire de Gilles Deleuze) as a media object, as part  of a workshop called  “Mediating Gilles Deleuze” organized by Nathan Lee and  Kenneth Berger at Brown  University. In eight  hours of interviews produced in 1988-89 by Pierre- André  Boutang and  screened on  French  television channel Arte  in  1994-1995, Deleuze is interviewed by his former student and  collaborator Claire  Parnet following a schema that  works  its way  through a Deleuzian alphabet from  “A is for Animal” to “Z is for Zig Zag.” He agreed to the project on the condition that it would only be screened after his death, and while making it he was already quite ill. In the  end  though, Deleuze outlived his ability  to resist  the  supplications of Boutang and the series screened the year before he died.
