In no way is this brief possession in this moment inauthentic as a copy or a shadow of  actual   movement;  rather it  is  fabulated, a  machinic ghost.  Faced  with  the endurance event of the abecadary, we might  all share in the exhaustion that by the end of the series is clearly visible. Exhaustion for Deleuze is not simply being tired, it is the  very  moment of possibility. To be exhausted is to have  exhausted the possibilities of  the  actual,   but  it  is  this  very  exhaustion that  opens   onto  the possibility  for  new   modes  of  subjectivation.  It  brings   us  back  to  Deleuzeâ€™s exhausted, signaletic spirit,  where we began.
