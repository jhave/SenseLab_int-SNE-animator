Deleuze, at the beginning of What is Philosophy? called a point of non- style. Pedagogy is not faithful transmission. Plato, Descartes or Kant are  not  faithfully portrayed.  But  the  impossibility  or  vanity  of faithful transmission is not to be identifier [sic] with  the freedom to grasp and  steal.  Stealing,  or  grabbing whatever you  like,  is not  a problem as  such.  The  problem would be  to  derive grabbing and stealing as a new general model, mobilizing against the dead conformity of transmission. This conformity is a ghost  anyway. We certainly never  know  what  we transmit because what  is meant to be transmitted never explains its own transmission. This is what  makes a relay interesting. Relay transmission implies both taking  over and handing over.  The  take  over  is always a  creation, but  the  act  of handing over also requires a creation, the creation of an arrow, conveying and  honouring what  produced the  one who  hand over, and will produce others.
