The image  is not  defined by the  sublimity of its content but  by its form, that  is, by its “internal tension,” or by the force it mobilizes to create  a void or to bore holes, to loosen  the grip of words, to dry  up the oozing  of voices, so as to free itself from memory and  reason:  a small,  alogical,   amnesiac, and   almost   aphasic image,   sometimes standing in the void,  sometimes shivering in the open. The image  is not  an object but  a “process.” We do  not  know  the  power of such images, so simple do they appear from the point of view of the object. This is language III, which  is no longer  a language of names or voices but   a  language  of  images,   resounding  and   colouring  images. (Deleuze 1997: 159)
