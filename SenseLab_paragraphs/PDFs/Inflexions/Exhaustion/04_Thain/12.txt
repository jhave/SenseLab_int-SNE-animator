In  “P  for  Professor,” Deleuze indicates the  way  that  an  uneven condition of reception, indeed an untimely attention economy, is fully part  of the pedagogical experience. Students in a classroom are not a homogenous mass  but  tune  in and out   of  the   lecture   at   different  moments  and   with   different  intensities  of engagement. Rather  than  capture the  domestication of focus,  he  suggests that lapses of attention and the textured fabric of a classroom space-time full of variable intensities of interest are fully part  of the pedagogical experience. This is one way that  resistance manifests against communication or information in the art of pedagogy. Deleuze likewise  emphasizes the  need  to stay  with  stupidity, by not asking  the  clarifying question that  simply releases  the  information via communication. He recalls how as a professor, students would pass him notes that read  “you  need  to clarify this point,  to go over this idea again,” polite  attempts to re-master Deleuze’s nomadic thought; these  notes,  he says,  pleased him enormously, even though he felt no need  to directly respond to the demands. An untimely exhaustion event  such  as screening the entire  abecedary reanimates the possibility of  sheer  consumption that  binging seems  to  provide. In  “A  is  for Animal,” Deleuze borrows an English  word from Melville  to speak  to the deterritorializing, fabulatory effects of undomesticated detours: outlandish. I want to turn  now to thinking the abecedary in such outlandish terms.
