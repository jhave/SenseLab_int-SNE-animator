Resistance, positioned against communication or information, is at the heart  of the pedagogical project that the abecedary self-consciously engages; this project bears a special  relation to exhaustion as the undomestication of rest. I want  to suggest that  this is the work  of resistance to information that  for Deleuze is the hallmark of the work  of art, which  neither communicates nor informs, a second quality of thinking the work as media object in terms of its status as a work of art or a creative act. How  might  we think  of the work  of art in relation to such a seemingly artless work  like the abecedary, devoid of formal  beauty and  with  a curious relation to performance? At the Brown event, the abecedary was aired in a fashion  that is both familiar and  strange, that  retains an undomesticating force of TV. Projected large like  a movie  in  a darkened room,  the  series  lost  the  medium-shot intimacy of domestic television. In the series, such consistent and homely framing is only half- heartedly broken a handful of times  through what  I came  to think  of as  “pity zooms,” more  numerous in the beginning and  practically gone  by the end  when the series gave itself entirely over to its artless  inertness.
