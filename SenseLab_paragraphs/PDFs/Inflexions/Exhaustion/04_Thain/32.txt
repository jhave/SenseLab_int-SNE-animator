endurance event.  Compulsive embodiment, like Tarkovsky’s stutterer, the boy hypnotized before  the  TV screen  or the  enabling hypnotism of the  women, is a mode  of possession, the movement impulse of being  compelled. For much  of the abecadary, Deleuze speaks with  a relaxed but  relatively static  posture. What  is notable is that  although his hands and  head  move  with  ease and  fluidity (if not extravagantly so), his torso tends  to hold  still as a block. As a viewer  aware of his illness,  I imagine this  is due  to  his  desire  to  not  set  off coughing, though his dreadful cough occurs more and more frequently as the series goes on. His posture isn’t rigid, but rather it is disjunctive, a bit like an animated figure in a cheap series where the part  that  doesn’t move  doesn’t get redrawn. This changes, though, in the  section  “T is for Tennis”  where Deleuze, who  has  previously spoken of the shame of  being  human before  the  television, and  makes  excuses  for  his  own viewing habits under the guise of the privilege of the elderly to watch TV, is briefly caught up in a passion and  his whole  body  moves  in a new way. Choreographed by the as-if body  of affect, his compulsive embodiment is but one of the multiple moments of possession that occur throughout the series, just here writ corporeally large. His body  dodges and swerves, engaging the whole  torso; it is as if his body is briefly  borrowed not by the spirit  of a player so much  as by an entire  attention somatechnics of  sports spectatorship, between ball  player, fan  and  social  and media ecologies.
