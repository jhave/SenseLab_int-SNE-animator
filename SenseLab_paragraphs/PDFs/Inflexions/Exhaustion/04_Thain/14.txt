In thinking the abecedary as a media form, one of my habits  was to look for where content is interrupted by signaletic material, what  I came to think  of as Deleuze’s ectoplasm. I read  the series’ opening orientations in those terms;  that is to say, via what  falls out of but also conditions the content “proper”—what deforms form. At the beginning of the series, before the first letter, Deleuze sets the context for what we are about  to see in a little preamble of bemused disavowal, in which  failures  of sense  are  opportunities for a kind  of playful and  productive nonsense, one  that keeps signaling throughout the series as a whole.  In particular, he sets the tone for how the series will deal with  the question of mortality, the speculative and  ironic tongue-in-cheek way that  Deleuze’s mortality is experienced as fully lived throughout. It likewise  stages  the complicated time  machinics of the form  of the series,  as Deleuze zig-zags through tenses  to destabilize his presence.
