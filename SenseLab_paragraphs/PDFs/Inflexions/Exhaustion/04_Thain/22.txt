The unruliness of the abecedary, its lack of domesticity, does  the same.  One final example to illustrate this is the felicitous  accident of the film’s formal  poverty, the opportunistic use of the unequal length  of sound and  image  recording medium. Shot on 16mm, the conversational flow was constantly cut by the regular rhythm of the  end  of the  reel,  and  Boutang elected  to  keep  these  stutters in  the  film. Throughout the series,  the images  often  starts  to flicker and  goes to black, while the sound carries on as Deleuze and Parnet continue the conversation in a medium with  a different recording timeline. More  than  once  we  hear  Deleuze finish  a thought from behind the bright  glow of the image  once the film has run  out, and the small decision to keep these materials in are not so much  the hallmark of authenticity as moments of ambiguous embodiment, an untimely speaking from the beyond of the image, an acousmêtre, as Michel Chion puts this (Chion 1999: 15).
