The entire  preamble sets up  the nature of such  machinic ghosts,  and  in Deleuze there  is little patience for a romantic idea  of haunting by pale shadows of former selves. While the figure  of the wasted or exhausted is the figure  of the creator  and philosopher across Deleuze’s body of work, this is always as the figure of the non- habitual exhaustion of the possible (Deleuze 1989: 209). “I am not in the habit  of answering without thinking through,” he demurs. But across  the  abecedary we witness what   Andrew  Murphie, thinking about   media form  in  Deleuze and Guattari’s work,  calls the machine in the ghost  (Murphie 1996). He traces  a shift, articulated through  Brian  Eno,  from  the  idea  of  “interaction” to  that   of  the “unfinished idea,”  to insist  on the  machinic, and  to foreground expression over signification.
