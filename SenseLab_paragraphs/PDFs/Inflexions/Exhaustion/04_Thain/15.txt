You have selected  as a format an ABC primer, you have indicated to me  some  themes, and   in  this,  I  do  not  know   exactly  what   the questions will  be,  so  that   I  have  only  been  able  to  think   a  bit beforehand about  the themes. For me answering a question without having thought about  it a bit is something inconceivable. What saves me in this is the particular condition (la clause), should any of this be at  all  useful,   all  of  it  will  be  used  only  after  my  death. So you understand, I feel myself being reduced to a pure  archive  for Pierre- André  Boutang, to  a  sheet  of  paper, so  that  lifts  my  spirits  and comforts me immensely, and nearly  in the state of pure spirit, I speak after my death, and  we know  well that  a pure  spirit  if you’ve made tables  turn.   [sic]  But  we  know   as  well  that  a  pure   spirit   is  not someone  who   gives   answers  that   are   very   profound  or   very intelligent. They can be cursory. So anything goes in this: let’s begin, ABC, whatever you want.  (Prelude to Gilles Deleuze from A to Z)
