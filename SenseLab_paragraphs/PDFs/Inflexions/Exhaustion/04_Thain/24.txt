synchronization, which  renders “the  visible  body,  not  now  something imitating the utterance of the voice, but something constituting an absolute receiver  or addressee. “Through it the image  says to the sound: stop floating  everywhere and come and  live in me; the body  opens  to welcome the voice” (1989: 332). The effect of this,  like the  strange and  persistent disjunction of temporalities that  Deleuze evokes as his “escape clause”  at the beginning of the series, is not an incorporation through synchronization that  would stabilize relation. Instead, Deleuze argues that  it produces a “pure informed person,” the automaton or archive,  as the one who  is most  open  to  connection and  receptivity (their  machinic quality). Thus “audiovision” in  the  series  is  a  “relational effect”;  in  the  abecedary, what   is motivated by a certain  fidelity  to thought and expression opens  small, arrhythmic gaps   in  the  flow  of  information  that   produces  an  effect  beyond  pragmatic necessity. Like the signaletic that  exceeds  signification, or expression in excess of content, we might  think  of these arrhythmic interruptions as the series’ stutter.
