not to put them  in the same plane  but what  if to experience sensation
the body  has to enter  space
one is already (in the) space one is already a compositionality with the lines and traces
with the traits  of sensation
that co-compose space
lines, zones, angles,  continuities, trajectories and speeds one is already a compound of these movements
a bloc of sensations body-space relationality a bloc of sensations
a compositionality of movements in-place
