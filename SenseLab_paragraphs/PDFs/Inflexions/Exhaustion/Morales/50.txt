so sensation is the way
to create a Figure
which  is different from creating something
in a representative way
a Figure  acts directly in the nervous system also a sensation is what  passes
from one level to another
and what  makes sensation pass
from one level to another
is a motor  which itself is made  of a compositionality of spasmodic
motions in-place
which  reveals
“the action of invisible forces on the body” (ibid 41).
