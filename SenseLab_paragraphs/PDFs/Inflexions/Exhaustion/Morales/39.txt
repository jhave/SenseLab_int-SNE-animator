deleuze talks about  how sensation is a way to
make a Figure  rather than  a figuration the first one being a mobile  composition while the second one a narrative
more depictional and representative
of a world out there
“the Figure  is the sensible  form related to a sensation;
it acts immediately upon the nervous  system,
which  is of the flesh”.
(Deleuze, Francis Bacon: The Logic of Sensation: 34)
