an entering into focusing:
what  i’m trying to do is to find a way
to articulate
a body-space relationality
in which  there’s no body  on one side and space on the other
but that there’s a process
where space is lived  in a different way than by a separation from it
there’s a difficulty in articulating this
it is all about  articulating that and building at the same time a way to articulate it
like what  i’m just doing  right here
