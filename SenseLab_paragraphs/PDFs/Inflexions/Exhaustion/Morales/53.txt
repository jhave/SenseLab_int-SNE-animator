a silent thought:
the reading didn’t happen like that
it jumped from chapter 6 to chapter 12 intermittently remember the reading was looking  for “blocs of sensation” so it went  back and forth
back and forth
jumping cutting jumping staying
wanting to go somewhere else
staying writing
as a way of reading
