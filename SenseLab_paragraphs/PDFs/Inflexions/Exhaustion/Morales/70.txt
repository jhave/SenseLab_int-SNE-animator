co-composing-with becoming thought around
a notion
in this case the notion
of body-space relationality
that asks

a kind  of diagram
a bloc of sensations contorting contouring
a body  for itself
in direct  relation with spaceâ€™s
own traces-traits
of continuities and speeds of random marks  and angles
