“affects are no longer  [emotions] or affections
. . . they go beyond the strength of those who undergo them
. . . they could  be said to exist in the absence  of man  because man itself is a compound of percepts and affects” (ibid) man itself is a bloc of sensations
the body  itself is a bloc of sensations
a-rhythmic compositionality
of invisible forces of bodily  de-formation
