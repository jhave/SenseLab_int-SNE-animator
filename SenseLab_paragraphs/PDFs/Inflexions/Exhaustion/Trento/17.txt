how   to  escape   exhaustion?  there   is  a  difference between exhaustion and tiredness,  according  to  Deleuze’s   analysis  of  the   Beckett   television  play Quadrat, in which  four  a-gendered characters try  to mathematically exhaust the  space  of a square through a set  of constrained movements never  really touching each other  but always in the threshold of an almost-touch, drawn in their  movements of desire  but never  actualized. “The tired  no longer  prepares for  any   possibility  (subjective):   he   therefore  cannot   realize   the   smallest possibility (objective). But possibility remains, because you never  realize  some of it. The tired  have  only exhausted realization, while  the exhausted exhausts all the possible”. i still don’t  see the necessity of having a body  every  moment of my life. i just want  to have a body  sometimes.
