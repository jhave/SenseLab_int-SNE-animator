i don’t  recall the last time  I heard Portuguese. I can’t look at people anymore on  the  subway. the  bald  guy  at  the  apartment  building entrance holds   a poster:  “animals are not  allowed in this  building” while  he gives  me a “fuck you,  strange queer” face.  I recall  I was  alphabetized in  that  language, but since  the  [subjective]  crisis  has  begun, it’s  like  Portuguese has  turned itself (inside  out)  into  a major  language for me with  a virulent infestation speed. a language that   penetrates  a  dense   forest   populated by  piles  of  enormous, heavy,  embodied order-words, condensing themselves in  growing cubes  of silver-tape material. I can barely  move  through its thresholds, my Portuguese struggles  to  ooze   between  them,   my   head   has   almost   been   completely transformed into  pure  metal,  melted needles, red  flesh  mixed  with  liquefied Portuguese. I can’t see the light or the sky anymore, the black cubes  block the sun, speaking is no longer  possible…
