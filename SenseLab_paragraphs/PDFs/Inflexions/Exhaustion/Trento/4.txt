Vampyroteuthis  is sexually excited by the world. He grasps the world with tentacles equipped with penis and clitoris. He apprehends and comprehends with sexual excitement,  and concepts lead him  to orgasm. For him  the world is not  sexually neutral and therefore insipid as it is for men. For him, everything has male or female knowledge and is therefore exciting. The male conceives of the world using different categories than the female does, and so there are male and female “laws of nature.” The world is not made of “neutral stuff” but of “mater” and “pater,” and the dialectic of the sexes is the dialectic of the world. All the other dialectics between truth  and falsehood, between beauty and ugliness or between Good and Evil, are reducible to the dialectic of sex. That is because Vampyroteuthis  did not repress the female aspect of the world like man has. For him, the world has both dimensions which have to be synthesised. That is why Vampyroteuthis  does not aim to reunite the world’s contradictions via theoretical edifices like man has, but via the vertigo of orgasm.
