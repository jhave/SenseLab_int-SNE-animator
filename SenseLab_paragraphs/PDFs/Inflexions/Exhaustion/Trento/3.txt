to  infer  the  affective   field  of  an  abstract  animal  based   on  three   different vibration points of each  body,  including sound awareness. the  animal was named the cloudy cat: an ethereal cat made  of the same  material/s as clouds. Following reverberating lines  from  its  calf  to  its  spine,  the  cat  vibrates. its touch-sense   connected   to   its   hearing  ability    of   positioning  within   a determinate ecological  environment. it is almost  like a cat, but as a speculative animal, it can  borrow some  of the  characteristics of an  abyssal  cephalopod being,  Vampyroteuthis infernalisâ€”cephalopodness. as if it was  the  result  of an  intense orgasmatic sexual  intercourse between a cat and  a giant  squid in profound and  dark  waters. the copulation leaves  a trail of fur and  fluorescent sperm that creates  bright  constellations in the reverse watery sky.
