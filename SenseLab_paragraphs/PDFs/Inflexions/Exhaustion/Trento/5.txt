after capturing some of the qualities listed  above,  unfortunately, a tragedy occurred, the  cloudy cat lost its nose.  since  cats are  usually driven by smell, this  could  have  been  the  end  of the  new  species.  however, losing  this  organ was  an evolutionary advantage. the cat feels pheromones’ perfume of a male or a female  individual of its species.  it is agendered, plurigendered, whatever. it  didn’t  even  need   to  feel  the  forms   and   figures   of  a  human, a  dog,   a mammoth, a  refrigerator or  a  popcorn vendor. all  pores  of  its  body  were capable   of  feeling  bunches and   packages of  sensations  and   of  navigating between them,  constructing a mutant sensory navigational map.  it only  feels the field of affectivity. this ongoing change is not painless.
