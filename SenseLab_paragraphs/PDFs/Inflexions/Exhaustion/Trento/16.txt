orgasm.  as  a  good   orgasm,  it  stresses  all  the   nerves   that   can   be  felt, embodying this  complete excitement of the  already referred cephalopod-cat interbreed creature. but  a good  orgasm would put  a dozen of organs and  a couple  or more  of human bodies  in a complete—but still full of multiplicities and  non-linguistic grunts—fusion. maybe  composing is a better  word for this. a  inverse orgasm disrupts  the  body,  dismembering legs,  eyes  and  fingers, making  the  act  like  independent entities,   promoting  total  separation and killing any metastability through exhaustion.
