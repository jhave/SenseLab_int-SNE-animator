contaminates; exhausting every  drop of energy in body  and  space.  the bodies feel these  disturbances as  big  black  holes,  drained by  the  nervous constant sweating exhaled by  every  furred pole  of the  skin,  drying body  and  mind until  complete [bad]  exhaustion. this  can  happen at  a very  quick  rate:  one subway trip  in a big city contaminated by micro  and  macro-fascist discourses and  gazes  can  drain an  individual for  days,  usurping his  conatus desire  for anything that  can compose well with  it: sex, falafels, black tea and  lemonades; little discrete entities  or copulation of entities  that can produce joy.
