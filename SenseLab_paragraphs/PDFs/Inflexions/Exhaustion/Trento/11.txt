language can  easily  turn  itself  into  a bad  disturbance in  the  affective  field, especially if language is rendered only  in  its  most  terrible face,  the  order- words. i imagine language as  two-faced, like  the  already very  exhaustively referred Roman  God  Janus:  one  face is occupied by a doorkeeper that  keeps asking  in his rough male  voice if you  are authorized to enter  his building or not.  the  other  is the  jaguar  face. it's a jaguar,  but  could  be also  a person. an ordinary wild  person. language is the most  savage  quality of the human. [the jaguar  just  an  author animal affective  preference, not  a stereotype of forest animals as the only guardians of savageness. in Postulates of Linguistics, Gilles Deleuze and  Félix Guattari state  that  the elementary unity  of language is the order-word, which  aims  to obey  and  instruct (impose) how  to obey  through enunciates.  every   word-order  is  a  little   death  sentence, a  verdict,  small needles growing in size  as they  penetrate the  ears  of this  mélange between this   blend   of  the   qualities  of  cephalopod/cat  and   myself.   even   being immanent, it can be felt as an extraterrestrial parasite that  has the capacity of disrupting  non-normative body-mind compositions, that  spill  blood  out  of every  orifice of the body: sweating, little spasms, coldness, shocked sensations in  extremities, goosebumps pulling the  skin  against the  body.  “language  is made  not  to be believed but  to be obeyed.” it intervenes … order-words are always masculine! [and  even  if they  don’t  have  a gender, they  usually come with a big and coarse exclamation mark]
