A Life
This is the contribution Gilbert Simondon makes to the body: he liberates it from the presupposition of a form, demonstrating how a body is alive across interphasings. Deleuze has a term for the force that is activated across these differential processes. He calls it a life, signaling a concept of life that extends beyond the specifically organic to touch on the force of becoming that accompanies all processes, all phases. A life is another term for the preindividual. It is what accompanies, what remains unresolved, in the taking of form, what defies the hierarchy of the organic with respect to the inorganic in the organization of what we commonly understand as “life.”
The field of experience is alive with bodyings, each of which are nodes of relation—ecologies—actively co-composing with the force of the impersonal a life that courses through them. The body as more-than is vitalist only in the sense that it never exists in the negative; it is productive, infinitely, of more life. “Do you know what Life is to me? A monster of energy . . . that
does not expend itself but only transforms itself. . . . A play of forces and waves of forces, at the same time one and many . . . ; a sea of forces flowing and rushing together, eternally changing” (Nietzsche 1967, entry 1067).
