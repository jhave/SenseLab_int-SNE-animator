Patterns are a key concept here. Amanda Baggs calls the ineffable morethan of experience “patterns.” Patterns are neither symbols nor categories as Baggs defines them. “I mean things fitting together in certain ways, outside of me,” she writes. “I mean perceiving connections without forcefitting a set of thoughts on top of them” (Baggs 2010a). While Baggs argues that patterns are precisely what is inexpressible in language, I would suggest that in the realm of composing-with, these very patterns make their way into language as the more-than of expressibility that is prearticulation. They populate expression at the edge of its intelligibility. The pattern is a field of force, a “manner,” as Whitehead would say, rather than a “matter” of becoming. Whitehead writes: “The manner of a pattern is the individual essence of the pattern. But no individual essence is realizable apart from some of its potentialities of relationship, that is, apart from its relational essence” (1978, 115). In language, the more-than of expressibility—the pattern—is transduced into a matter for articulation or, as Whitehead would say, a “matter of fact.” Contrast is how the matter for articulation actualizes: contrast spurs the subtraction. It fields pattern: “the realization of the pattern is through the realization of this contrast” (Whitehead 1978, 115). The “realization” of actualization does not replace the pattern: contrast subtracts from the resonant field of patterning even as it holds the resonance of the pattern in quasi-appearance. Contrast is contrast precisely because it is more-than the sum of its complexly divergent parts. Contrast brings to expression how the actual is also, to some degree, a field of vibratory potential in-act.
