The body is a multiphased relation that defines itself through coefficients of transversality expressive in the practice of becoming. Its project is to move life to its limit and at this limit, where the outside folds in, to express, again, differently. The body is infinitely variable, not subject but verb. And as verb it persists, infinitely.
