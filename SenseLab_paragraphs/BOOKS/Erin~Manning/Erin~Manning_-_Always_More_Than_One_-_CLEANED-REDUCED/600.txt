What is concretely in act is never the general category. This is why starting with a general category cannot not yield nuanced results. Take, for instance, the question of gender. While (en)gendering—as speciation—has many roles to play in an event such as that between Kanzi and Prince, “gender” posited as a pre-formed category cannot make sense of their encounter without imposing a framing device onto the event from the outside. This has the effect of backgrounding the in-act of the event, losing sight of the intricate complexities of the event’s acting out. For instance, a general statement about the general category “woman” in relation to Prince would immediately connect her body to a certain set of qualities or criteria that would mediate the event of her encounter with Kanzi, who, as a “male,” would then be expected to respond in certain, often stereotyped, ways. To posit the genders male/female as the framing device would also ignore the fact that gender identification tends to be speculative at best for many autistics, for whom having a fixed body, let alone a fixed gender, is one of the most abstract of all abstractions.8 What is concretely in act, I want to suggest, is never a “gender” but an engendering, a coming-into-itself of a singular set of relations, of which male-likeness and female-likeness may be defining elements, but always only in their in-actness, in tandem with co-constitutive elements active in the associated milieu. This engendering opens the field to new constellations, some of which may be allied to gender, others of which may constitute forms of speciation not yet defined and categorized.
