Autism is a modality of becoming before it is any kind of state. This is not to negate the movement disorder that tends to accompany the “classical autism” of which I speak throughout, nor to downgrade the myriad everyday challenges that tend to set autistics apart. It is simply to emphasize what classical autistics themselves continuously underscore: that autism is also and perhaps especially a way of perceiving the more-than of the coming-to-appearance of a worlding always under way. With autistic perception—which is on a continuum of perception not limited to autistics— there is never first a line, then an image, never first a frame, then light. Here, in the field of the more-than directly experienced, the resonance of eternal objects activating a relational field of quality can be felt, with form a residue—almost the afterthought—of a process too intensive to articulate easily in spoken language. What we see: a thinking-feeling that folds perception into experience without the orientation of explication or form as an intermediary.
