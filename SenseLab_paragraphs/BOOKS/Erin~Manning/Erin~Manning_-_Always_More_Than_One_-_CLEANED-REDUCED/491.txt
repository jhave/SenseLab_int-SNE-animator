There is no mindblindness here. Mindblindness dwells in the neurotypical world. It lurks on the edges of a notion of politics that speaks of democracy as though we had all acceded to the level of easy breathing. And it lurks within a macropolitical notion of ethics that seeks to place moral standards on behavior, an ethics that overwrites, that judges and sequesters into socalled intelligibility the agitation of all ecologies that do not resemble it.
