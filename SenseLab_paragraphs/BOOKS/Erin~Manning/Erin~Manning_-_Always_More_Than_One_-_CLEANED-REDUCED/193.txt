A life percolates. Unlike some of Waltz with Bashir’s critics, we must not mistake “a life” with the life of the filmmaker, overlaying it with Ari Folman or with a generalized version of the Israeli or the Palestinian body. This is not what churns at the edges of the film. A life is the bare activity of the surface folding, of the background foregrounding. A life pushes through the plane of immanence, always on the verge of appearing, making itself felt, but never “as such.” Beyond good and evil. Protopolitical, preindividual, a life shapes the sensing surface. We are caught by it, but only peripherally, for it has always already moved beyond in a welling of a new proto-territory. It is activation on the edge “at [the] intensive limit of life” (Massumi 2009a, 170). It is the waltz in Waltz with Bashir.
