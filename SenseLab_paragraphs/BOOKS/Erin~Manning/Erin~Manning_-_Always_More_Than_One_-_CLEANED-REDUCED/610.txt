Novelty abounds, a novelty spurred by the complex of self-enjoyment, appetition, mentality. Think mentality as the event’s thinking-feeling, as Massumi might say, a feltness in the thinking resonant at the edges of experience. Each occasion dances with this not-yet, its becoming always in counterpoint with the more-than of its will-have-been. Time folding: recall Forsythe’s “dance into future movement!” (2008; see also Massumi 2011b). Mentality is perhaps the wrong word for this intensive process, this “organ of novelty,” or “urge beyond,” for despite this not being the case, mentality, like its earlier counterpart, reason, still sounds as though it is in the mind or of consciousness (Whitehead 1929, 33). We might therefore simply call it “thinking-feeling,” emphasizing how it is an activity in the event that co-composes with the occasion’s physicality to create, in the act, a contributory more-than that emphasizes how novelty is a process of thought in the doing. Mentality “seeks to vivify the massive physical fact, which is repetitive, with the novelties which beckon” (Whitehead 1929, 33). The force of appetition, as mentioned above, could be another good term for mentality in that it emphasizes the hunger of a process which opens the occasion to novel motifs, activating in the occasion a “factor of anarchy”
(Whitehead 1929, 34).
