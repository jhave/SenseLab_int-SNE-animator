Moving through them, we find ourselves beside their anguish, our pace now a little in advance of their movements. We dread what we are about to see. In the distance we see him, facing them, the soldier-filmmaker, his face filling the screen, his previously impassive face slowly falling apart (figure 9). As we approach, as the face beckons larger and larger, we see that the face is no longer pure surface: it is leaking, breathing, chest heaving up and down, mouth slightly open, eyes roving. We feel the faceâ€™s breakdown, the loss of its contours, and through this intensive folding we feel the whole metaphysical surface of the film folding into expression. But it is not expression of content: we do not see what he sees, our backs still to the women. What he sees: the ineffable, the ungraspable, the horror.
