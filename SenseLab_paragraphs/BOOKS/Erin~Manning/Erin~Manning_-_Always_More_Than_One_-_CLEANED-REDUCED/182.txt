The music videos that appear sporadically in Waltz with Bashir are a mode of accessing the strange interval between remembering and forgetting. We feel this interval sonorously, in a strange betweenness of color and sound, in the discordant rhythm of the feeling-telling. These music videos create an eerie fissure in time, transporting us through sonorous events into the tight circuit of the virtually actual, leading us, as music can, into the affect of a recollection that is also of our own making. Until the voiceover returns—and it always does—we waver in the between that music can call forth, a between that places us fully in the feeling of the past, in the present. In the music video scenes this sonorous continuum overlays the film’s surface, multiplying the strata. The music videos play with audio-vision at the limit where the pure experience of the time-circuit vibrates, inviting us to feel the forgetting as it happens: “Transcendental memory . . . grasps that which from the outset can only be recalled, even the first time: not a contingent past, but the being of the past as such and the past of every time. In this manner, the forgotten thing appears in person to the memory which essentially apprehends it. It does not address memory without addressing the forgetting within memory” (Deleuze 1994, 140).
