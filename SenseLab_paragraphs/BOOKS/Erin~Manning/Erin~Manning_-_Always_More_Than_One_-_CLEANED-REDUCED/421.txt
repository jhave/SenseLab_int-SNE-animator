As an example, think of a hospital and consider it in procedural terms. Ask what it holds in place. Inquire into its architecting of mobility. Then recall the last time you were sick or visited a sick friend. Reexperience the hospitalâ€™s entropy of sameness, pale wall after pale wall, high bed after high bed, closed curtain after closed curtain, double door after double door. Recall the smell and note how the smell affected posture, appetite, rhythm of walk. See, hear, touch again the glare of metal, the shrill soundscape, beep, beep, the cry behind the half-closed curtain. Note that devastation takes the smell of loneliness, that pain comes with a taste of grit. All this in the name of life. A procedurality not for life-living, but for the suspension of this life in treatment against death. Humanity, toward death staved off.
