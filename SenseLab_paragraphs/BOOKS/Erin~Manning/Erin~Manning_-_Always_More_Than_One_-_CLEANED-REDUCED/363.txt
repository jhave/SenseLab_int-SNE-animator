On top of this, it is already hard enough for DJ to try to mask the complexity of sensation he lives with every second of the day without having to spontaneously learn what we neurotypicals might have in mind when we select out one sense (touch) and incite him to follow our lead. What can this even mean to someone for whom the concept of discrete sense modalities remains a mystery? For DJ’s experience of the world, like many autistics, involves a complex synesthesia where it is unclear how discrete modalities on their own do the work of sensing. What can touch mean to those of us for whom to sense is to participate in a crossmodal orientation toward the world, where to smell means to hear color, where to see means to taste sound? Intense synesthesia creates an agitation of perception complicating the parsing out of experience into this or that—this touch or that fabric— undermining the easy separation of human-actor and object-receptor. For the autistic, to be in the world is to world, to experience the unfolding, in all of its complexity, of the commingling of all drops of experience.
