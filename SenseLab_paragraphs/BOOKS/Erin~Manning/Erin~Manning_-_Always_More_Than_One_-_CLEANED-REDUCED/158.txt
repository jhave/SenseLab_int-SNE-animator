What—as allied to Being—is the question of transcendence, the question of interiority and depth, while how—as allied to process, or becoming—is the question of the transcendental field. There are no questions that cannot be dangerous in their own right, that are protected from returning to habits of thought, but there are few starting points as lethal as the totalitarianism of Being: “I” is a habit, and where it leads is toward the supremacy of the human. Being and the human-as-supreme cannot be disengaged, and with the human at the center, the frame is unequivocably in place for the eclipsing of the complexity of other ecologies, of other surfaces of experience.
Foregrounding the metaphysical surface as the how of experience in the making opens the way for a different proposition. For how does not delimit a field according to preexisting parameters: it opens it to its outside, to the outside as it curves back in on the topological surface that never quite contains it. How brings us back to the protopolitical and the dark precursor that is its movement of thought, to politics at the very cusp of its appearance, at the bare edge of its agitation. How does not guarantee against the return of fascism or the microfascist tendencies the political can and does call forth. But it at least offers an opening onto the potential of a forking, onto a life welling at the winding surface that is the singular limit between now and now.
