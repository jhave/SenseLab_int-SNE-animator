Never conscious of itself, the transcendental field is the qualitative duration of the without-me of relation, of life-living. Radically empirical, it emerges, barely, at the interval of feeling and felt. When we feel it, what we feel is the cut of the interval, the between of its singular appearance here and now. In Waltz with Bashir we feel this quality of the active interstice in the intensive surfacing of amber-gray-black, we feel it in the resonant field created by the contrast of the bright and the dull, we feel it as the intersection where the impossibility of strategically coupling then and now expresses itself. Throughout Waltz with Bashir, we are never really out of this intervalâ€”
we never rest in the amber-gray-black. Its stark contrast moves us each time anew, reminding us that the past cannot be doubled onto the present, that what emerges appears in the multiple now of life in the making, of life fabulating.
