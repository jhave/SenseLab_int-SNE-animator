The dynamic form gorilla-like is bred in play. Prince and Kanzi run, on all fours, along a fence, laughing, grunting. There is no outside to their game: it is not meant for anyone else. Play is unself-conscious. Improvisation, spontaneity, mixed in with the constraints of incipient territorializationsâ€”the fence, the time of day, the newness of the encounter with gestures no doubt at first quizzical, careful, and then perhaps engaged, untroubled even, at times. Instinct, some people would say. Art, others would respond.
