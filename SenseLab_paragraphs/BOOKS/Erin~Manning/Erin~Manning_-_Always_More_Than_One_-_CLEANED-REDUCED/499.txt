Ettinger’s Autistwork n2 is small (26 x 22.5 cm). The technique of its execution, like the others of this period of painting on paper that hold the mark of a photocopying process halted, is one of subtraction. Begin with a photograph—of family, of war, of loss—and disallow the image to resolve on paper by stopping the photocopy machine halfway. Burn the copying process into the image while allowing the toner to unsettle. Create a shadow, a blur of pastness. And then activate the passing-by of the photographic image not by giving it a form—not by repainting the “completeness” of the image having passed by—but by undoing it of its ground, by painting the very impossibility of the image ever finding a secure resting place: “What is being painted is ‘the instant where the instant turns its back’: turns back on itself” (Massumi 2006, 203). This turning back of the instant on itself creates the sensation of an abyss in the seeing, a folding vortex that catches seeing in the making, transporting the act of seeing with a tumultuousness that is visceral. Notice that even when there is the sense of a form, an image, or a narrative, nothing comes to rest. The quality of the work is not its renouncing of the image. Nor is it simply a turn against image into the ineffability of trauma. The folding is not an abyssal infolding—something is called forth. Something excessive, an almost unseeable more-than in the moving is at stake here.
