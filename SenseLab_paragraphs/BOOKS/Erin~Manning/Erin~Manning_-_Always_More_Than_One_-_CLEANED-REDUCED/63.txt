For Deleuze and Guattari, absolute movement is a vibration, a resonance that precedes all form or structure. Absolute movement is without a subject—it passes through, it flows, but it does not yet cut: “there are only relations of movement and rest, speed, and slowness between unformed elements, or at least between elements that are relatively unformed, molecules and particles of all kinds. There are only haecceities, affects, subjectless individuations that constitute collective assemblages” (1987, 266).
This singular displacement, this occasion of experience—these are cuts from total movement. They land total movement, dimensionalizing it, opening total movement to an actualizing in concert with the now of time in the making. Total movement is felt in the now when the incongruity between the force of an infinity of potential and the limit-cut of the actual work together to activate the resonant shadow of a movement-moving that, while it never quite actualizes, continues to move through the actual movement such that movement-moving co-composes with what is actually experienced in time. Everyday movement tends to background this quality, but this does not mean the force of movement-moving isn’t always active, contributory.
