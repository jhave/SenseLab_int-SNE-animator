In Autistwork n2 redness catches vision in its abyssal folding, looping the whirl, flattening the vibratory surface (for all surfaces are also folds), tuning it toward a provisory stilling. Redness as a doubling verticality in the horizontality, a line in the non-line of a force shaping. Not quite an image: the welling of a force for the seeing. For what we see is not the red, or even the shadow-purple, but foldings-through fields of force that continuously and infinitely tremble the shaping.
The force of the welling image emerges as light in the between of colorlessness and the redness in the purpling. It emerges as the surfacing for perception of a field of resonance. To see Autistwork n2 is to see the very edge of see-ability. It is to see-with the feeling of experiencing a vertiginous loss of ground.
