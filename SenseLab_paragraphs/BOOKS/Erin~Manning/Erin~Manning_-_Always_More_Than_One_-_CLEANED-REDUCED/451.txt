The writing I will focus on here is largely what Ralph Savarese (2012) calls “autie-type,” which he describes as “the spontaneous production of figurative language that occurs when Autist, facilitator and computer come together in the act of communication.”7 For autistics on the “classical” end of the spectrum, where motor-control issues make the voice difficult to access, communication is often restricted to typing, which tends to necessitate a facilitator, as seen in the encounter with DJ at the SenseLab in the interlude “Fiery, Luminous, Scary.” Savarese coins the concept of autietype to emphasize that this modality of writing is a genre in its own right, an intrinsically relational way of thinking and communicating. Savarese believes that this relational quality in the composing has a role to play in what we have come to see as the exquisite poetic voices autistics have collectively honed. Theirs is a relational writing, he argues, a writing that activates the associated milieu not simply of environmentality but of words themselves—a worlding in words.
