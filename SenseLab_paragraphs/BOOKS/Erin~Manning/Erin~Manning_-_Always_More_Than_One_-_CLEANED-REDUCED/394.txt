As emphasized in chapter 4, bodies move in active memory of the present-passing, which is simultaneously a remembering of the future in the tense of the déjà-felt. Ask a dancer to describe in language the way he just moved and he likely won’t be able to do it. The movement moved him at a velocity too quick to remember in a time impossible to grasp as such. Yet the dancer’s movement remembers. The movement can move again into what the dancer “himself ” cannot quite hold onto: movement-moving is active in a futurity virtually impossible to articulate except through movement. Its position can be grasped after the fact, but to tap into its intensity of variation, it must ultimately be recalled in the moving. To tap into movement-moving is to recall the future in its presenting: in the moving, the future-pastness of movement’s force of form is tapped into, cueing all the while to diagrams in the making.
