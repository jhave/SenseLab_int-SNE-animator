In their desire to affect the force of form, Arakawa and Gins are political artists: they understand that art cannot create new modes of existence if what it builds on is preexisting content. They know that to invent involves creating at the interstices of multiple interscalar event-times. And so they craft kitchens that are at once opportunities for cooking and invitations for climbing. Their hope? To “help [us] cradle tentativeness.” They design floors that can be an opportunity for walking, but are as likely to be an invitation for dizzying, for toppling, for rolling, “to use [our] bodies in unexpected ways to maintain equilibrium.” Architectural surrounds less for “getting somewhere” or “doing something” than to orient toward new extrusions from position, in order to “practice not to die.”6 And this way, in the dancing of the form’s outdoing of itself, they literally make a place for the political.
