The notion of the limit plays two ways within tracings, activating both the constraint that allows for the tracing in the first place—for there to have been a line, there had to have been a certain quality of movement, a certain opening within the territory—and the barrier through which the line must fold or break. There is never indifference at the limit. Everything matters. “The space of the maps on which the movements of everyday life are inscribed configures a common space where the trajectories are not indifferent to the presence of others, where a limit appears in the comings and goings of the children who up until now the adults would not follow, a limit centred on the space of a life in common” (Querrien 2006, 169). Think the limit as an activation contour onto which a certain tenor of movement moves. The limit not as that which delimits the “common” but that through which a commoning becomes expressive. The limit as enabling constraint of a commonality in the making, a language unsaid but ripe for the moving.
The common as becoming-body, as more-than, is not the result of a negotiation. The common is never there in advance of the field it proposes, it is a coming-to-expression of the associated milieu of life-living. Here, in the milieu of life-living, new forms of life emerge that are not beings so much as dynamic shapings of experience in the making: bursts and broken circles, hard lines and soft contours, agitated crossings and ludic darkenings of the field of experience in the moving.
