If a “we” does emerge it is an uncommon we: “The wE of which I speak is the inverse of a we-two: but it is not a myth and resides discreetly with all the forms of a we-here, we-there. To respect it requires no doubt a certain rigour for which I would be incapable of formulating rules” (Deligny 1976, 24). “We” here is multiple—always more-than the expressibility of its taking-form. For the “we” in the tracings, in “the language we speak,” is a field continuously co-constituted by the events it calls forth. It never knows what to say in advance of the saying. The “we” is adrift. “Tracing maps . . . is first to try to not speak, to not want to know. It is to accept that there is more than the human, that there exists a human who is nothing of ourselves and yet is nonetheless there without knowing who he is, who is there closeby without anything to do” (Han 2006, 188). They drift “to try to see from the other side of We, to no longer enclose, and to stop thinking in the mode of ‘I.’ . . . ‘I’ is but a truncated metaphor for Deligny, the source of all their delusions and missed encounters, a substantive forged by the history of discourse, a stranglehold of grammar” (Han 2006, 188).
