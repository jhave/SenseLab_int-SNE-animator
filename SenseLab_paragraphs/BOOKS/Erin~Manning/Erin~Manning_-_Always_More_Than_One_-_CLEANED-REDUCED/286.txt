Choreographic objects activate an environment for movement experimentation. The idea is to create an atmosphere that slightly tweaks the time of everyday movement, inviting it to tend toward the time of the event. Participants who enter White Bouncy Castle (see figure 11) are not only transformed into “bouncing balls,” generating a playfulness that inflects the environment. They also become participants in time of a different order: a time of experimentation.
