The transcendental field filters into experience as the virtual agitation of life welling. It is not yet delineated into subject or object: it moves intensively across, preindividually, aberrantly creating remarkable points that emerge, eventually, as the subjects and objects of the next now. It resonates with these singular events of becoming, propelling series into actualities that carry with them the germ of its intensive surface.
