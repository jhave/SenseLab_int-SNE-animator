The outside is a fold on the topological surface of a becoming-body. New compositions emerge on this surface through the bursts of the singular becomings dephasings call forth. Bursts because dephasings involve a bringing-to-life of new processes, new fields of feeling. “[T]here must be a more-than-being, a new individuation, so that sensations can coordinate into perceptions; there also has to be a more-than-being of the subject so that affections become affective world” (Simondon 1989, 116).
