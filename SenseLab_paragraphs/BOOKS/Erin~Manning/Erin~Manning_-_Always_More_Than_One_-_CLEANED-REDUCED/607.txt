When Whitehead says that nature “is impenetrable by thought,” what he means is that thought does not enter into nature from the outside to orchestrate it from without (1929, 13). Nature is not a passive element to be mediated. Nor is thought a mediating activity. Nature creates thought— a thinking in the event. This thinking makes ingress into the event in large part through the constellations speciations take. Nature and speciations are co-combinatory—they cannot be taken separately. The question is never, as Whitehead underscores, “what is in the mind and what is in nature” (1929, 30). The question is “how is gorilla-like”: how does nature’s play move lifeliving, creating thought?
