We all chunk. We are all categorizers and users. Lifeâ€™s conventional elements demand that of us. But we are all also transcendental-fielders. After all, a chunk is only a chunk against the contrasting background of the field as singular-generic spacetime of experience. Chunky ones come in serial iteration, against the many-more-than-one of a continuum of variation backgrounded by traditional logic and conventional use. We all chunk, and we all field, but to different degrees, in varying ways.
