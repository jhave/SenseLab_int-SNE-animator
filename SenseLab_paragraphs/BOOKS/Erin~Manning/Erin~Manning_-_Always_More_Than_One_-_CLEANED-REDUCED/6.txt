It would seem obvious that a process is different in principle from its products, and that this difference calls for concepts tailored specifically to it. One of the most evident ways a process differs from its products is in the span of its activity. A process brings together the factors that go into bringing about a result by drawing on a different, always wider, field of activity than the product once arisen will entertain. Processually speaking, a making is always bigger than the made. The making includes, in germ, the form of what will come to be, as well as the functions its being, once arisen, will afford. In addition, it includes the under-formation and the clinchinginto-operation of the functions-to-come. Formation is more inclusive than form-and-function. The span of a becoming is broader than a being. An individuation is more encompassing than an individual. To understand individuation, this more-than of becoming can never be lost from sight. However obvious it is that a process is different in principle from its products and deserves accordingly different concepts, this is rarely taken to heart. If the concepts of subject and object are not deferred, their forms and functions backcast on process, overshadowing the conceptual complexion of the under-formation. This is what Deleuze and Deleuze and Guattari analyze as the “transcendental error” of “stenciling” (décalquer, trace) the empirical characteristics of constituted being onto the formative process of its constitution. Manning’s foregrounding of the notion of individuation is a way of advancing the account of the reciprocal presupposition of the one and the many in a way that avoids this transcendental error, never losing sight of the ontogenetic differing of process from its products, of constitution from the constituted.
