Dawn Prince (2010) writes: “I hope that autistic people, and others that have been beyond understanding until recently, will be the natural interpreters of an important patois.” The patois of which Prince speaks is a language replete with the sensitivity of autistic perception, thick with a force of thought in the middling of its expressibility, textured by a more-than of future movements and unchunked experiences, ripe for the infralinguistic telling. The incomplete answer to “are you a gorilla?” is spoken in such a patois, a language that can only be heard in the moving, in the infra of positioning, in the choreographic thinking that is always in the beyond of subject and object.
