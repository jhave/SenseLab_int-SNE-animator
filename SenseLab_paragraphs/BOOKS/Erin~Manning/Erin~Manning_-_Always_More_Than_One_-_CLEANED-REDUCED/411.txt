This ethos is not a moral category. It is a quality of relation. The concern for the event is not an individual’s concern. It is the “how” of an event’s concrescence. This concern for the event in its unfolding is linked to another Whiteheadian concept: importance. As Whitehead defines it, importance is the force of the infinite in the finite that distinguishes this event from another and makes it stand out in the constellation of a wider nexus of events of its kind. “Importance, limited to a finite individual occasion, ceases to be important. In some sense or other, importance is derived from the immanence of infinitude in the finite” (1938, 28). Importance, again, is not a category imposed on the event. It is how the event has come to feel its coincidence with other events in its emergence as this or that singular concrescence. A politics in the moving begins with the germ of importance at the heart of the event’s ethos. The dance of attention can be understood as the resonant field through which this is expressed.
