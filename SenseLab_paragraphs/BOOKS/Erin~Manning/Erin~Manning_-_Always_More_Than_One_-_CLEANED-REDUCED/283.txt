Forsythe’s choreographic objects tend to find their point of departure in the form of an everyday object: a balloon, a piece of cardboard, a mirror. That they are everyday objects allows for a certain ease in the encounter with them—they are recognizable, malleable within our habitual movement practices, already available to our imaginations: we think we know what they can do. And yet, just as the objects have lured us into certain presuppositions, we find that these objects are more than what they appear to be at first glance: in the setting of a choreographic encounter, they present themselves as part of an evolving ecosystem. They extend beyond their objectness to become ecologies for complex environments that propose dynamic constellations of space, time, and movement. These “objects” are in fact propositions co-constituted by the environments they make possible. They urge participation. Through the objects, spacetime takes on a resonance, a singularity: it becomes bouncy, it floats, it shadows. The object becomes a missile for experience that inflects a given spacetime with a spirit of experimentation. We could call these objects “choreographic objectiles” to bring to them the sense of incipient movement their dynamic participation within the relational environment calls forth.
