As I mentioned above using the example of Sue Rubin, when autistics learn to write or speak, they are often said to have “awakened” into language. While in Rubin’s case she is referring to an ability to bridge expressibility with expression, when the term is used with the notion of “coming back” it becomes very problematic. “Coming back” depends on the idea that without language, existence is barely human. “Dov seemed to be demonstrating a level of intelligence that I had never suspected or dreamed he might possess,” writes Portia Iversen about her son’s coming into language. “I could barely begin to comprehend what this meant. . . . It meant that he was not retarded. It meant that he’d been in there . . . all these years. I could barely keep from crying” (2006, 290; my emphasis).
