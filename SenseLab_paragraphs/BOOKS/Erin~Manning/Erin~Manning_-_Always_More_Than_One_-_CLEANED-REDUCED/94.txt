Transindividuation
What is known as such, it bears repeating, is not the preindividual, not the nexus, or a life, but the forces of collusion that bring a multiphasing process of individuation to an individualization. But what is also known, albeit in a different register than conscious knowing, I want to argue here, is the excess, the more-than of this process.
The in-act always involves a tensile weave of the actual and the virtual, of the preindividual and individuation, of a life and this life. This is why each actual occasion is more-than what it seems. It is more-than because it carries in its dephasing a quality of a surplus that cannot be contained by the occasion. The occasion is implicitly multiple—collective—in the sense that its emergence involves not only its definiteness as this or that, but its complexity as a field of relation that co-combines with the nexus of which it has been/will have been part. An occasion cannot undo itself of the tensile weave of which it is made. Any occasion is at once the absoluteness of it-self in the moment of its concrescence and the will-have-become of its tendencies, attunements, and appetitions, both past and future.
