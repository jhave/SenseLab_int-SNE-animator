Whitehead writes: “The community of actual things is an organism, but it is not a static organism. It is an incompletion in process of production” (1978, 215). Kanzi and Prince meet. Play ensues. Their movement moves them, connecting them at the level of speciations that exceed them as individuals. In the speciation, a counterpoint emerges. This emergent counterpoint is a structured improvisation: it moves into the habitual movements brought into play at the same time as it connects to a generative field of movementmoving. The generative force of movement in counterpoint activated in the moving creates a motif. This prolongs the dance, giving it a style all its own. This style exceeds Prince or Kanzi as individuals, exceeds their habitual ways of moving—a relational movement has emerged. This relational movement is a field experience. Everything is concretely at play—the quality of air, the sound of breath on metal, on fur, on skin, the feel of paws on earth, on cement, the heaviness of limbs at play, the grumblings of stomachs, the pull of muscles, the rustlings of fallen leaves. Everything singularly contributes. And in this field teeming with activity, a question is drawn: “Are you a gorilla?” This is not a question intended to be answered: it is a motif. It is a platform to spring from through which new movement-constellations can take flight. Gorilla-like is a new concept.
