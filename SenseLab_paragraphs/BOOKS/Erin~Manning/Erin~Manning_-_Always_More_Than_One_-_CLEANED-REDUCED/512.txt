The wide breadth of perceptual richness experienced by autistics—and also by neurotypicals, under certain conditions4—cannot easily be bridged in words, which renders explication difficult.  “Conventional  language only allows me [the] terms [of the neurotypical], so I have done my best to point out the enormous and beautiful world of experiences that lie between those words and beyond the limits of a language never equipped to describe them,” writes Baggs (2010a). How to articulate the realm of the not-yet, “that richness [that] is infinite compared to the broadest of humanity’s finite capacities?” How to explain that the body is not bounded? “Am I made up of thoughts or am I made up of my body?” asks Baggs (2010a). “For a long time I had no idea of waking or dreaming concept because everything looked as an extension of thoughts. Thoughts would get alive like anything that is alive” (Mukhopadhyay qtd. in Biklen 2005, 121). How to share a fielding of experience so rich that it continuously reinvents the frame of existence? “My first memories involve sensations of all kinds. Colors. Sounds. Textures. Flavors. Smells. Shapes. Tones. These are short words, but the meaning of them is long, involved, and complex. Some things caught my attention, others did not, but all of them were absorbed into my mind. It is hard to explain to another person the patterns of perception that come before the ones they themselves have” (Baggs 2010a).
