And yet, as Stern demonstrates with the concept of vitality forms, all experience is in-forming. It is replete with the “lulling” “spinning,” and “vague formations of sensation” Tustin describes (1984, 278). “Shapes” are everywhere active, and, despite what Tustin says, the process of shaping is not predominantly “autistic.” The only reason to foreground the autistic here would be to underscore the way autistics seem to be capable of lingering in the shaping, capable of slowing down the process of shiftingto-content. As Roy Bedward writes: “Never think I’m not paying attention when I’m not looking because I’m always paying complete attention to everything. I just can’t begin to say how much you miss when you make your attention narrow and focused. It is the bane of autism to be able to attend to way too much.”
