In 1967 Fernand Deligny takes on a project of living with autistics in order to explore the potential of a different notion of care not encountered within the institutions that seek to organize experience and pathologize those who cannot speak the dominant language. Over a period of more than two decades, Deligny leads a network of encampments in the Cevennes at Monoblet where autistic children are paired with local people assisted by interns. The idea was to welcome children between the ages of three and ten who were mute (“out of language”—hors parole, as Deligny calls it). The cost was very low and the stays could last “between three or four months, three or four times a year” (Toledo 2007, 683).
