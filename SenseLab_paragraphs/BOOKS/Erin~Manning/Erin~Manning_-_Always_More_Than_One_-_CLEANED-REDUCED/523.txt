The Autistwork series foregrounds that it is the how of the painting’s coming to appearance that knows (not the artist)—just as it is the ecology of relation of autistic perception that knows (not the autistic). It demonstrates that the how of knowing much exceeds the what (and the who) of knowing. It makes the more-than of image or object felt. It makes seen the constitutive difference between knowing-with and a more generalized knowing—knowing as categorization, organization, representation. It reminds us that to know is to participate in a folding that will remain an intensity too multiple, too ineffable and too infinite to articulate without composing-with. To know is to know-with—to participate in the creation of worlds, worlds churning with the exquisite singular-infinity of eternal objects, seeings-in-the-feeling that continuously reinvent what perception (and knowing) can do.
