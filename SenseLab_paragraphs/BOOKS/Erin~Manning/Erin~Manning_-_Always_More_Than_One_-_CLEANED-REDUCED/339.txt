This screen was conceived as a velocity-prime, affecting not only the speed of entry into the event but the very appearing of the installation. We suspected that rather than simply ducking under this space-undulating screen, some participants might pause in front of it, taken aback by a certain vertiginous realigning of the event-space. Participants entering this way might find the posture of their engagement altered. The third option was to walk toward the right of the installation in a beeline toward the wine. Moving this way, the participant would likely not even notice the screen (or the dark greens on the far left), focused as they would be on the refreshment-attractor, the reds and browns at the far-right end of the installation appearing only at the threshold of their perception, if at all. Each of these modes of entry, conceived as enabling constraints toward affective tunings of the event in the moving, were techniques conceived not only to alter how the installation emerged for participants but also to explore how a decisional cut changes the experience of participation.
