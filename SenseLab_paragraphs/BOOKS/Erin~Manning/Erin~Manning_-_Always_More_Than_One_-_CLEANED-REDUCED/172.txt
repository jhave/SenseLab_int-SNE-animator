The amber-gray-black is the fourth person singular, as Ferlinghetti calls it. It is the desiring machine that moves us across the surface of the image, not so much feeding the narrative as fuelling the intensive absence of a linear reminiscence. It promises no mimicry of itself, no representation, no absolute recognition, no ultimate tying of loose ends. It keeps us poised at the limit, that edge where terror haunts the image. This edge is never transcended. It remains the affective tonality of what cannot be expressed: the transcendental field of a micropolitics in the making.
