Individuation
“The body” is a misnomer. Nothing so stable, so certain of itself ever survives the complexity of worlding. And yet we inevitably use the concept as shorthand—how else to talk about issues of agency, of identity, of territoriality? Relation is the quick answer, with “the body” as a certain version of an endpoint, or, better said, a transition point. The body, here defined, is what comes-to-be under specific and singular conditions. It is the amalgamation of a series of tendencies and proclivities, the cohesive point at which a multiplicity of potentialities resolves as this or that event of experience. If the body isn’t the starting point, what is? According to Gilbert Simondon, the body is a relative fact, a phase of being. Every phase of being is coconstituted by two commingling dimensions of process: individuation and the preindividual. Individuation and the preindividual cannot be thought separately—they are two sides of the same coin. Individuation is process in its unfolding through a multiplicity of phases. The preindividual is the phaseless excess—the more-than—that envelops yet exceeds the nowness of the process in its unfolding. The preindividual is the germ of potential in every activity. It can be thought as the force of becoming akin to the pull of the Deleuzo-Guattarian virtual where it combines with the actual. The preindividual is real and it is felt, but only in its effects. Later, I will pair it with the Deleuzian concept of a life, which is similarly conceived as the force of life that exceeds this life yet cannot be experienced without it.
