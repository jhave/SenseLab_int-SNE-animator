The installation was pristine, the color combinations startling, and the shapes seductive. What I didn’t immediately realize, however, was that the museum was having its effect: the collection looked more polished, the racks lending it a professional aspect, but the architecture as a whole was far less supple. The collection looked contained by preexisting space. I worried about how to get the participants going since I had little control over the participants’ modes of entry into the event-space and since the collection looked so much like an art object. I needn’t have been concerned. Before I knew it, the participants had taken possession of the fabric, their rich and varied experience with textiles—this was part of a wider textile exhibition and therefore attracted many participants with extensive backgrounds in fibres and design—an obvious entry point into the concept at work in Folds to Infinity. They were immediately engaged but on a different level from what I had experienced at the first Slow Clothes exhibition, wanting to know more about the craft of the work—about the buttons, about the cuts, the patterns, the provenance of the fabric—than about how to make it move. I found myself enthusiastically involved in the object qua object: dressing and undressing, we talked about the difference between Indian and Chinese silk, between the plastics used to make buttons of the early 1920s compared to those of the 1950s, about pattern cuts and the intensive passage between shapes and volumes.
