This is how the choreographic object works. Think of entering a room replete with mirrors that reflect an entrancing kaleidoscopic array that refuses to contain us (The Defenders, Part 2, 2008; see figure 12). We are attracted to the mirrors yet perplexed, for we are accustomed to mirrors refracting us. This activates a movementâ€”we find ourselves experimenting with our own reflection, bending, swerving, jostling to be seen. And in so doing we become more and more aware not only of our own approach to the nonreflective reflecting surfaces but to a collective grappling with the way the mirror is refusing to behave as a mirror.
