Improvisation is not born of technicity, however. Technique is its grounding. It is born, paradoxically, through the repetition of a certain form-taking. Without the rigor and precision that comes of repeated, habitual activity, improvisation’s potential vocabulary is too narrow, its implicit force too backgrounded to be functionally emergent. To create the new it is vital to have experimented with the outer limits of a vocabulary that is highly technical, and from there, but transversally, to invent. This invention takes place in the associated milieu—it is not I who invent but the bodying process itself, across the activity of movement-moving. Remember that the associated milieu is the environmentality of the technique in its dephasing, the field where technique and technicity meet.
