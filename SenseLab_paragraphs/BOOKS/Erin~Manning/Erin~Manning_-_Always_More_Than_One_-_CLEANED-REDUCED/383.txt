Step 1: Lie down on the floor. Close your eyes.
Step 2: Begin to create a diagram of the space. Allow the diagram to settle. Step 3: Find an open space in the diagram and move into it, virtually.
Step 4: Locate another open space. Move into it.
Step 5: Wait. Feel timeâ€™s elasticity. Feel the space shifting.
Step 6: Keep your eyes closed even while you keep moving in and through the diagram.
Step 7: Slowly stand up, eyes still shut. In the standing, reencounter your diagram. Step 8: Wait.
Step 9: Find another opening within the diagram. Step 10: Move into it, actually this time.
Step 11: When your movement slows to a standstill and the diagram has solidified, slowly open your eyes.
