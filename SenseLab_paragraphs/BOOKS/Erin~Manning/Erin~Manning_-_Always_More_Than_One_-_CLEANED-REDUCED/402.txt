Each of these techniques creates the basis for a mode of existence that bridges the oeuvre in its divergence while activating its resonances. A mode of existence is not a superficial marker of similarity across an oeuvre. It is not about finding confluences between paintings by a given artist or locating similar forms in a choreographer’s repertoire. Modes of existence are thresholds in the workings of the work that mark a certain productive dephasing of its process. They refer not to the form the work takes but to the consistency of its capacity to exceed a predictable form-taking across varied iterations. The mode of existence activated by an artist’s oeuvre is felt more than seen, plotted not to position but to its very outdoing in a realm of expression that is more technicity than technique.
A dance of attention is the singular expression of the wider range of expressibility of a mode of existence. A dance of attention is not a general occurrence: it emerges only when the conditions are right. It can be felt when, in the shift from technique to technicity, the incipient potential of a set of emergent relations is tapped into, when a web of precise yet open-ended intensities courses through an event rigorously tuning it to its more-than. A dance of attention is a direct feltness of the field of emergence, understood here as a quality of infinite potential with a margin of indetermination at its core.
