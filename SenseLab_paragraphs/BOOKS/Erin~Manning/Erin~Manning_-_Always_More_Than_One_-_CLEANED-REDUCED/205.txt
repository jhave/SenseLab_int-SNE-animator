When we arrive, the scene is set: fascism beckons. “You know that picture from the Warsaw ghetto? The one with the kid holding his hands in the air? That’s just like the long line of women, old people and children looked.” The victims are walking toward us, their bodies black against the amber night sky. We are looking straight toward the child’s face—the child who reminds us of the child from the Warsaw ghetto—his hands up in the air. The child walks slowly toward us, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten seconds, but though we recognize his gesture, his slow walk reaching-toward a memory in the making, we cannot quite see him, we cannot quite make him come to life, to our life. His face remains shadowed by the amber-black. Color-light before face, surface before content. And yet we know the content and it haunts us: we are there, back at the camps, in the fascisms of our memories.
