Life as such—this life—is known through the dephasings of processes of individuation. Yet each dephasing also activates a germ of force, a remains, a more-than of this life. Every life-welling carries within itself both the activity of its emergence in the now of experience and the seeds of its having-been many-phased: “an actual particle has its virtual double, which barely diverges from it at all” (Deleuze 1997, 150)—a collusion of the remarkable point with the associated milieu of relation.
