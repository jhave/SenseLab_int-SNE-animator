Perhaps. But this is the politics of procedurality: that to begin is to begin again, differently, impossibly, impractically. It is to begin not with form but with the force of the more-than as articulated by the welling diagram the event calls forth. What Arakawa and Gins bring to the table is the proposition that diagrammatic praxis is one of circulation and modulation. Begin and begin again, in the middle. A diagrammatic praxis may delve into an existing structure such as the hospital but it will only affect it if what is targeted is the creation of new modes of existence that defy or outdo its structure. This is what Arakawa and Gins mean by their proposition “we have decided not to die” (2007).
