In its most common definition, as Klien, Valk, and Gormley (2008) state, choreography is a verb—the activity of arranging relations “between bodies.” Pushed to its limit, this statement suggests that what is crafted choreographically are not bodies as such but relations. Choreography less as that which is generated by the human for the human than a practice that foregrounds how the event itself attunes to a relational milieu that exceeds the human or wherein the human is more ecological than individual. Choreography as a practice that asks, as Deborah Hay does, how each cell attends to the encounter movement proposes.3 Choreography as a practice that attends to the immanent field of relation that is part and parcel of environments in-forming. For choreography is, in Guattari’s terminology, a heteropoeisis, a self-generating practice of difference. It is at once, as Klien, Valk, and Gormley suggest, “a dynamic constellation,” “an exchange of forces,” and “the act of interfering and negotiating the [emergent] order” (2008, 17). Choreography: the act that sets into motion a milieu. Choreography: the milieu’s self-generation into event.
