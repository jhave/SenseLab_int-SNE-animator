I wonder whether this tension within language is partly what moves autistics to be so creative in their use of it, inviting as so many of them do the poetic voice to be multiply embodied in the writing, activating registers of feeling that allow us to glimpse the prearticulating more-than of expression in-forming.25 The result is a writing that continuously astonishes, a writing with a precision and a sharpness that hits at the core of preconceptions of the role signification and denotation play in language. Expressing the force of what language can do, making apparent how prearticulation cuts across signification even as it allies itself with it, autie-type travels across denotation to invent with the more-than that is at the heart of composing-with. As Larry Bissonnette writes, “I am seriously past learning swimming in the shallow end of the pool of language” (Savarese 2012).
