Another way to talk about the practices through which incipient tendencies express themselves is to differentiate between modes of existence. Modes of existence, for Étienne Souriau and Gilbert Simondon, are emergent modalities of life-living nascent through an event’s form-taking. Modes of existence never preexist a given individuation. They are immanent to it. Nor are they, in relation to art practices, about the more superficial notion of style or genre. Modes of existence refer instead to an emergent fielding of tendencies that bring a given work or series of works to life across iterations. For example: the mode of existence of William Forsythe’s oeuvre is not the representation of a type of movement or style of content. It has to do instead with a certain quality of experimentation associated, certainly, with the tools the Forsythe Company uses to create movement potential out of the more-than of the dance figure, but not limited to them. To speak of a mode of existence is to find within the practice the singularity that gives it its diagrammatic force.
