The shape of enthusiasm lurks in and beyond language, across the lines of drifts, at all scales of life-living. Deligny suggests that this shaping creates a commoning, a common emphatically beyond community and commonality, beyond communication as the making-symbolic of life-aslanguage, beyond the social as the organization of the “I.” “The social is created economically, in the norm, and has nothing in common with the common, with the welcome of one and each. The social separates the wheat from the chaff, it sorts, and it merits itself. And it creates its remains, the ‘scum’ in the etymological sense of the word; these remains are for Deligny discoveries, the apparition of the other, what counts in a life” (Querrien 2006, 168). A commons in the crossing, in the composing.
