A body is black, gendered, sexed, you might say, adding that these are irrefutable givens that situate the body within the realm of fixed form. Irrefutable, yes, but only as the limit of a constellation of processes that collude to foreground one measure of how the body expresses. Identity is less a form than the pinnacle of a relational field tuning to a certain constellation. The question is not “how is the body not black or gendered or sexed?” but “how is the body more-than the classification this singular constellation foregrounds?” The question here cannot be limited to the body “itself” as though the body weren’t active in co-constituting the ecology at hand. If that ecology tunes to categories such as color or gender, these aspects of the field will continue to be foregrounded. The issue is not to deny this but to ask how these ecologies come to co-constitute a body in this or that way. The point is not that there is no form-taking, no identity. The point is that all form-takings are complexes of a process ecological in nature. A body is the how of its emergence, not the what of its form. The issue is one of engendering: how does this singular taking-form happen given the complex collusions of speeds and slownesses, of organic and inorganic tendings, of activities and movements, that resolve into this or that body-event?
