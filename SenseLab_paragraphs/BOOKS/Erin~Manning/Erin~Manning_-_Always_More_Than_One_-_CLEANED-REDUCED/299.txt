Scattered Crowd is an indoor weather system. Volumes of air in the moving move an environmentality itself in the making. A shift in ground results, a shift in the very idea of what collective movement can feel like when it becomes a lived practice of attunement. Movement as weather exceeds the objects, the subjects in its midst. Choreographic object: a proposition for the “what else” of choreographic thought, a proposition that moves the milieu, the associated milieu of relation.
