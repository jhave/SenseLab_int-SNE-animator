Before I turn to the story in detail, I want to begin with the epigraph above where Dawn Prince writes “The gorillas regarded me.” This regard of which she speaks is how I want to frame the engagement with Prince’s story, beginning right away with the speculation that the regard about which Prince speaks sets the stage for the encounter with the bonobo Kanzi, shifting it from one of detached observation to one of concern. For Whitehead’s notion of concern, as outlined throughout this book, is very much about the emphasis on a different notion of regard, regard not of the subject for the object, or of one individual for another, but of the occasion for its own unfolding.
The notion of concern is one way of reworking the dichotomy of subject and object, reinserting them in the event: “The occasion as subject has a ‘concern’ for the object. And the ‘concern’ at once places the object as a component in the experience of the subject, with an affective tone drawn from this object and directed towards it” (Whitehead 1967, 176). The subject does not begin the process: it is the process that activates the subject. “The subject-object relation can be conceived as Recipient and Provoker, where the fact provoked is an affective tone about the status of the provoker in the provoked experience,” Whitehead writes, adding that “the word ‘recipient’ suggests a passivity which is erroneous” (1967, 176). Concern is not an intersubjective term but rather the basis for understanding that experience emerges through “the rise of an affective tone originating from things whose relevance is given” (Whitehead 1967, 176).
