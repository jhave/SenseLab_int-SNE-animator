The choreography of One Flat Thing, reproduced proposes modes of entry into the collective movement of a dancing surface that is inherently compositional. The dancers co-compose an event that in turn postures them. Their bodies are primed. But in this future-past vectorization of the surface welling toward a mobile architecture, it is not only the dancing body that is primed. The whole spacetime of distributed relational movement is at the ready, already reconfiguring in a tending-toward-cueing. The thightabletop, the table-spine, poised for recomposition. What is composing is the very between, the interval that activates each of these becomingassemblages. What is composing is event-time, not time as separate from moving bodies, but time as collectively embodied duration, rhythmically attending to the dance.
