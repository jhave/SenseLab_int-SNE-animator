But let us not stop there. The accusation of anthropomorphism whether misplaced as in the case of Kanzi and Prince, or fitting in other instances, need not be a reason for us to return to our old habits of generalizing and categorizing. For is it not true that the accusation of anthropomorphism has become one more way of not attending to the complex counterpoint of the creative advance? As Jane Bennett writes, a “touch of anthropomorphism . . . can catalyze a sensibility that finds a world filled not with ontologically distinct categories of beings (subjects and objects) but with variously composed materialities that form confederations. . . . Maybe it is worth running the risks associated with anthropomorphizing . . . because it, oddly enough, works against anthropocentrism: a chord is struck between person and thing, and I am no longer above or outside a nonhuman ‘environment’ ” (2010, 99, 120).
