The complexity of vitality affects and how they create fields of intensity is apparent in Baggs’s statement about the challenge of facing social environments. As she makes clear, it is not that she “withdraws” or that she can’t engage. It is that the feeling of the event—its vitality affect—takes over to such a degree that she cannot extricate a “contained self” for interaction from the event’s dynamic emergence. Amanda Baggs directly experiences the event’s vitality, the force of its taking-form. This experience shapes her bodying, calling forth a field of relation through which she emerges as a multiplicity rather than a static, interactive self. To interact in a selfcontained verbal way would involve parsing this multiple taking-form into a single activity of form-taking. For Baggs, it would mean parsing one very minute aspect of actual experience from the wider and richer realm of pure experience.
