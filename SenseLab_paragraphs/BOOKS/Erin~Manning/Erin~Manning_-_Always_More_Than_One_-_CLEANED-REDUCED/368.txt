What is the difference between playing and creating play? To be forced to play is like being forced to touch. Not only does it potentially do violence to the complex relational field in co-composition, it also presupposes an already-homogenized arena of engagement. This tends to put play squarely in the realm of a local interaction instead of within a field of relation where what is foregrounded is not the human per se but the more-than of experience in the unfolding. Was there enough nuance within the artworkâ€™s proposition, I wondered, to activate relation beyond the linear model of a localized interactivity?
