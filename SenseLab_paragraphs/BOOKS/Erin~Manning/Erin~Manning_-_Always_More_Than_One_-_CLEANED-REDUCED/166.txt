This short washed-out amusement park scene haunts the film. We see it, but they don’t—the filmmaker and Ori continue to speak about memory as though nothing had happened, as though their discussion hadn’t already changed the imagescape’s course. The appearance of the amusement park behind the filmmaker’s shoulder cuts into the past/future circuit he is working so desperately to unravel, bringing a new surface to a complex topological field of recollections of the forgotten past and dreams of the unimagined future. And then, a few seconds later, the semblance of the amusement park gives way once more to the dreary backdrop of an outside garden, things back “as they should be.”
