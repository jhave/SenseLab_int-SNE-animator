DJ increasingly found himself in a fix. He wanted to engage with the work, wanted to see touch as the invitation to play, but understandably felt that play was tinted with expectations not yet fully worked out. What if in the playing, tactlessness reared its head, re-stereotyping him? For DJ is visibly autistic and has had enough of being accused of untactful behavior—too loud, too disruptive, too excited, too alive. He has been taught over and over by a largely uncomprehending normopathic world to not touch-engagerelate with such verve, so directly. Here, in the context of Folds to Infinity, he risked once more being “too much” or, even worse, being “taken as stupid,” as he calls it. For while there is no question that DJ is highly intelligent, a scenario whose stakes are muddy risks putting him in a position wherein he is incapable of properly working out the conditions of the environment and rising to the occasion, thus reinvigorating the deep anxiety he lives with, and making his motor-activation issues more acute.
