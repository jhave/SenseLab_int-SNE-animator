Despite appearances, movement is not of a body. It cuts across, cocomposing with different velocities of movement-moving. It bodies. The body-as-such is an extraction that appears in the collision of movementmoving and actual movement, a momentary collusion of tendencies that seem to make up a whole. Form in its bare actuality is a mirage. With total movement always coursing through it, form is infinitely more-than. Extrude the body, as William Forsythe would say, to find this movement in the more-than, to find the movement-moving coursing through actual movement.
