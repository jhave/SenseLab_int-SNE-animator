The repeated scene of the bodies rising out of the water begins as a promise: it looks like a flashback. As with all flashbacks, we are lulled into the feeling that there will be a denouement, that the scene will grow into its content rather than withdraw, again and again, into the expressionless face. Coming as it does soon after the first scene—the dreamscape of ambergray-black dogs barking, of violence on the cusp of playing itself out, the city caught in a web of fear—we assume that this scene of bodies emerging from water will hold the key to the missing facts that memory holds at bay. We are almost certain the scene will provide the clues to the Sabra and Shatila massacre, that the rising bodies moving into the amber-gray night of war will let us know how the repressed returns.
