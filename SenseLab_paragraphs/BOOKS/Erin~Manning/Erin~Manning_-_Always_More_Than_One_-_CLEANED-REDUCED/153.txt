A life is how the drama of the political expresses itself in Waltz with Bashir. It is Nietzsche’s (1967, 157) “Was that life? Well then! Once more!” and Massumi’s (2010a, 2011b) “bare activity.” It is the force of agitation that pushes the virtual to the limit, the dark precursor that propels the doubling of transcendence and immanence into the pure experience of the now. It is the activity of the metaphysical surface, and, as such, it is the force of expression of the transcendental field.
