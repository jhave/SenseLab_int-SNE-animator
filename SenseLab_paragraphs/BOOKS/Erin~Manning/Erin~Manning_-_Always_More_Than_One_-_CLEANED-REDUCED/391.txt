In chapter 5, through an analysis of the techniques proposed by Forsythe and his dancers, techniques that take counterpoint to a very complex limit, I explore how what cues and aligns is not the human body per se but the landings of sites for future cueings and alignings. These landing sites are more than human. They are the active force of movementâ€™s fieldings in co-constitutive spacetimes of experience, felt as the coming and going of tendencies too quick for the actual perceiving. Certainly, a body moves. But what moves the body is more-than cue, more-than alignment as such. What moves the body is a tendency for movement, a movement of thought. This tendency feeds a collective process, shifting it toward a new aligning. Alignment is a moving with incipient tendency that realigns the choreographic whole, shifting not simply the body in space, but the space bodying.
