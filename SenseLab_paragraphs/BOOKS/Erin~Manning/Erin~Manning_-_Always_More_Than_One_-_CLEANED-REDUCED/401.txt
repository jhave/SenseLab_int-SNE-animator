“Put the activation into every part,” Forsythe suggests, “think about where the movement starts and stops—if you raise your arm, where does your skin stretch? Activate the skin.”3 This task, invented for a choreographic process, results in certain qualities of movement expressibility that lead the body-space continuum to reconfigure itself less in terms of balletic position (though the movement can take fugitive balletic form) than in the unmooring quality of the more-than of a given position. In another context, such as William Forsythe’s Woolf Phrase, a different technique is necessary. This piece, which draws from the work of Virginia Woolf and complexly intertwines the spoken word and the dancing, explores the intensity of activation across two modalities—the voice and the body-becoming. In this case, a technique is needed to tune language to an otherness of expression where words and movement taken together are capable of creating an active interval that pushes both beyond the limits of their form such that we begin to feel the words in the moving. Another piece, NNNN, depends on a different set of tasks or techniques. NNNN is a quartet that explicitly draws out the breath of the dance. In a play of cueing and aligning, the piece breathes the movement that ensues. Here, the dancers might explore principles of preacceleration and relational movement. For while they move together in what seems to be a call-and-response scenario, what unfolds is a complex resonance of incipient movement: the dancers move in the moving of each other’s movement.
