When the senses are as acute and as complexly entwined as they are with autism, it can be very difficult to partition the environment from its sensations. Amanda Baggs explains: I was pouring water from a large bucket, onto an electric fence. I slowly realized something was different—no, bad—no, very bad—and hang on, it seems to be in the vicinity. And colored bright white, and . . . oh yeah, painful, and pain has something to do with my body (???), yeah it does, but where on my body, . . . , . . . , . . . , . . . , . . . , arm. My arm is a part of me. Let me turn my eyes on. Now look at my arm. Stuff on my arm. Stuff . . . water. Where is the water going? Fence. Electric . . . oh. Better stop this. Where’s the arm again? Got to move it. (Wait for those instructions to mosey down into my arm.) There. Phew.
