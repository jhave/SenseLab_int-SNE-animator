There are an infinity of ways of touching on the more-than that is movement-moving. Dance is one example. What dance gives us are techniques for distilling from the weave of total movement a quality that composes a bodying in motion. This quality is a vibration that exists as a movement of thought. Not a thinking that is outside, beyond movement-moving, but a thinking that composes-with movement, with-body-in-the-making. A thinking that defines its own terms, in the moving, that touches on the realm of absolute movement as it co-composes with actual movement. A thinking that activates the more-than of the physical form, of the body precomposed, thinking it into act. A thinking that activates not only the morethan of this movementâ€™s potential, but also the more-than of this or that body. A thinking because the doing resonates with thought. To move is to think-with a bodying in act.
