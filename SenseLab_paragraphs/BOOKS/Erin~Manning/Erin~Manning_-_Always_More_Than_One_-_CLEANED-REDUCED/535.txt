This is the language we speak, we who can talk without sound. This is our voice in the silence
Where every word has weight, and no thought is ever lost. This is the language we speak,
we who embrace without touching, This is our dance without bodies
Where every touch has meaning, and no glance is ever wasted. This is the language we speak,
we who can see without looking.
This is our star behind darkness
where velvet rainbows sing, and no tear falls unseen.
This is the language we speak, we who can float outside time.
This is our home beyond nowhere where shadows’ footsteps fall,
where memory echoes from the future, and comfort flows back from the past, where smiles have no need for faces
and warmth breathes from the frozen places. This is our source, our destination,
where every song is heard, and no soul shines unknown.
