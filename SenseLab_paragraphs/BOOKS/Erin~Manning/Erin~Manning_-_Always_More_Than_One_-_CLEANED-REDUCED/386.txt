A notable dephasing comes with step 7—Slowly stand up, eyes still shut. In the standing, reencounter your diagram. Here, in the recalibration of equilibriums, preaccelerations of movement potential cross the vertical-horizontal axis, leaving the body-diagrammatic unmoored. What has shifted here is not the body per se but the conditions for bodying in movement. As participants stand with/in their shifting diagrams, what tends to happen is the experience of an intensifying of mutation, a multiplying of intervals. Some participants describe this as a heightened sense of the becomingenvironment’s affective tonality: they talk about the intensification  of sound or touch; they talk of space becoming multidimensional.
