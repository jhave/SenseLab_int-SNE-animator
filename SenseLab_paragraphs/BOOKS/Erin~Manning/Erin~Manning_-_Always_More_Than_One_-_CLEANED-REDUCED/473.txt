Baggs consistently challenges categorizations of personhood associated with language acquisition and “passing” in the neurotypical world. For Baggs, language is both that which facilitates an understanding of radical difference and that which dangerously restricts this same difference from being valued as such, subtracting as language does from the wealth of relation that is pure experience. “I don’t quite have words for this” is a common complaint of hers, and yet more words, more ways of composing, always follow. Take this as an example: “There are so many injustices, large and small, that affect autistic people. None of them are divorced from the injustices that happen to others. None of them are unique. Autistic people are not a special kind of people set apart from all other people. We are just one of many kinds of people, and oppression and injustice take depressingly familiar shapes. My task here is to scale the cliffs of language and shout up to you the pattern of one or more injustices” (Baggs 2010a). Here, the ineffable more-than of composing-with is heard, and felt. We are drawn into the cadence of what at first seems like a straightforward set of problems to cliffs of language and patterns of injustices. We are pulled into a world that is actively shaping around the more-than of denotation.
