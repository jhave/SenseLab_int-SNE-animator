Nik Haffner, a former dancer for the Ballet Frankfurt,5 discusses the overlapping use of metric and durational time in Forsythe’s choreographic process. What strikes Haffner is that despite the use of instruments for quantifiable measure (clocks, metronomes), Forsythe’s interest seems to lie less in the measurability of time (and the body’s coordination to that measure) than in “events that are, given their timely complexity, unreproducible” (2004, 135). Rather than treating quantified time as the organizing node for choreography’s expression, Forsythe urges his dancers to become flexible in the time of the emergent event such that what is felt, in the moving, is “how measure and duration coexist in the activity of creating bodies of time” (Haffner 2004, 136).
Choreography as propositional works with coexistent tendencies overlapping toward the creation of new vectors. It activates a diagrammatic force that exceeds the description or the representation of a process. In sodoing it creates a transduction, a jump in register that incites a new process—from a thought of movement to a movement of thought, from time measured to time felt.
