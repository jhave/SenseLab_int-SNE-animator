The dance of attention of experience in the worlding is brought to expression by autistics in an infinity of ways. What much of the writing has in common, however, is its capacity to make felt the intensity of attending, of participating in a worlding that never stops dancing. “Attempts to freshly respond to humans were terrifying quests through killer trees. Where I sent my real self, reasonable, easy breathing, satisfying humans never could find me” (DJ Savarese qtd. in Savarese, forthcoming). The writing is a play of rhythm and image, a relational movement of incipient becomings expressive in a toward that is not linear but diagrammatic, intensely phasing, topologically orienting: “Sadness drew the trees together. Wasted, freaky actions took over my arms. The trees desired to feast upon me” (DJ Savarese qtd. in Savarese, forthcoming). In autie-type, it is as though the complex process of subtraction becomes strangely palpable, as though the uneasiness of the more-than surfaces in the breaks, the pauses, the punctuation, in the rhythm and the metaphor. How, in the intensity of an incipient diagrammatic praxis, how to select, asks the writing? How to move expressibility into and across the metastable field of attention’s dance? How to make words world? “Part loving person, part plant I kid people. Only the kids who look beyond loud noises hear my real self” (DJ Savarese qtd. in Savarese 2007).
