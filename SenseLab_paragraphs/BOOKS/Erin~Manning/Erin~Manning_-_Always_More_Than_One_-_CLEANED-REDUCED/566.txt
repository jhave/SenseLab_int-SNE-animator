The already-felt is content premapped onto experience. This does violence to experience, if for no other reason than that in order to consistently reappear as the form of what-was in the mode of the already-felt, the content will have to be policed, held together, frozen: no experience can truly be replayed quite the same way twice. Content premapped requires a suffocation of time, of process. It requires the premapping onto experience of the no-time of the will-have-known-in-advance. Pathologization happens in this no-time of experience.
