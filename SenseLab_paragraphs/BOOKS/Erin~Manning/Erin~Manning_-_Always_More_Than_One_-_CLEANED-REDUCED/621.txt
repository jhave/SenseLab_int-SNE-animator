There is counterpoint in infinite abundance and we are not hearing it, let alone dancing it. Ecologies of perception are backgrounded by an overarching emphasis on general categories. New modes of attention are needed, and persistent efforts to experience the novelty of life-living are essential to enjoying the complexity of worldings that populates us. The more pressing question is not whether or not an engagement with the more-than human is anthropomorphic but what exactly it is that has led us to the certainty we seem to have that the world can be parsed out into subjects and objects, and how intertwined this assertion has become with a notion of interactivity that sets itself up not as a radical empiricism but as a mediating interplay between already-existent terms. James’s mantra bears repeating: “the relations that connect experiences must themselves be experienced relations, and any kind of relation experienced must be accounted as ‘real’ as anything else in the system” (1996, 42). There is no object “in-itself” just as there is no subject only “for-itself.” To cite Whitehead again, “the occasion has a ‘concern’ for the object. And the concern at once places the object as a component in the experience of the subject, with an affective tone drawn from this object and toward it” (1967, 176). Subjects and objects edge into experience, relationally. Not human-relationally but in an incipient relation that speciates.
