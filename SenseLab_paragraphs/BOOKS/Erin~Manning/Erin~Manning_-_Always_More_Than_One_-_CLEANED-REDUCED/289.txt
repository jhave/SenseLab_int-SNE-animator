The piece has created a movement, a circling in on itself, a beckoning to a kaleidoscopic landscape that is not of us and yet somehow draws us in. Or, as in the case of the piece when it premiered in Holland, what might have taken over is the collective desire to reorient, to alter space, to create with the conditions of the objects such that they metamorphose. The collective resistance to the injunction “do not touch” in that instance created a repositioning of the field such that the quality of play was activated less in the not-seeing of oneself than in the repositioning of the object in relation to the mobile gaze. Either way, there was a lived experience of a choreographic  proposition.
