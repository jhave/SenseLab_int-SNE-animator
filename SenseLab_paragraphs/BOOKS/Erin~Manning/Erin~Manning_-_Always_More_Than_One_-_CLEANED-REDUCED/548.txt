Tustin’s analysis of “autistic shapes” feeds into this very tendency, using the psychoanalytic language-oriented by-line of her era. The human individual is the norm, and to be human is to be in language in a specific way: it is to be capable of symbolizing the processual, of stabilizing experience. The autistic who lingers in the shape of enthusiasm must therefore be divested of her attachment to the processual, must be taught to speak, and, more specifically, must be taught to articulate the content of experience in terms of already-formed objects and events. “We live in a world dominated by words and by the shapes of actual objects,” Tustin explains to justify her claim that it is counter to the autistic’s well-being to dwell in the process of shaping (1984, 280). The ineffable, the unspeakable, must be avoided at all costs, for there is no future, no capacity for survival in “the language we speak.” Tustin is adamant: “Autistic shapes are not merely psychological curiosities. They are blocks to more normal functioning” (1984, 284). This is why Tustin must so quickly move toward the “curing” of autistics of their shapes. For while Tustin agrees that there is likely a “normal” “inbuilt disposition to form ‘shapes,’ ” she is adamant that ultimately there is no place in the normopathic world for the ineffable in-act of shaping.
