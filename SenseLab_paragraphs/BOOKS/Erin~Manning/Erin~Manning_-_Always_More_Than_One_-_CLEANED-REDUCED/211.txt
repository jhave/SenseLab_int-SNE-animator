Relations of force are relations in their incipiency. They are tendencies in the making. Their will to power is a fight to the death between the metaphysical surface and transcendence. Transcendence often wins, because in the end it is easier to give up on the amber-gray of the face-as-surface, to turn away from the ineffable, to make the individual both the starting point and the endpoint, to background the uncertainty of relations still informing, to place blame, to live in resentment, to be a victim, to be guilty, to be innocent.30 Yet to make the personal political—to opt for transcendence—is to radically underestimate the power of fascism and its unique ability to morph into folds of experience as yet unthought.
