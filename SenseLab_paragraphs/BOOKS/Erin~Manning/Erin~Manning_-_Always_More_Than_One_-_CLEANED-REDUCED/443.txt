Does this attunement to life as an incipient ecology of practices, an ecology that does not privilege the human but attends to the more than human, demonstrate a lack of empathy? Asked about his capacity to feel empathy in the context of a miner trapped in a mine, Mukhopadhyay writes: It’s true that when I think of the situation, there may be empathy. But my empathy would probably be towards the flashlight batteries of those trapped coal miners if there happens to be a selection on my part. Or my empathy would perhaps be towards the trapped air around those coal miners. There would be me watching through the eyes of the flashlight cell the utter hopelessness of those unfortunate miners as my last chemicals struggled to glow the faint bulb so that I didn’t leave them dying in darkness. As the air around them, I would try to find a way to let myself squeeze every bit of oxygen I have to allow the doomed lungs to breathe, for I am responsible for their doom. And while I found myself trapped, I would smell the burning rice being cooked with neglect in an earthen pot. (Mukhopadhyay and Savarese 2010)
Empathy not explicitly for or toward the human, but with the world in its emergence. An ethics of relation.
