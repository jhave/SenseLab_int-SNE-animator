Now think this in terms of a dancing body and consider José Gil’s concept of overarticulation, which can be defined at the felt experience of the form outdoing itself. In rehearsal, William Forsythe asks his dancers to think about “what it was about the position that made it motion?”5 Overarticulation is one way the technicity of movement-moving—movement beyond position—makes itself felt. The dancing body overarticulates not by bringing content to form or form to content, but by foregrounding the virtual share of technicity coursing through and across its movements in the making.
Overarticulation is steeped in technique, but to make itself felt it cannot remain on the stratum of the technical. Forsythe calls it “looking for a chain of sensations rather than a chain of positions.” Without ever referring to overarticulation as such, Forsythe speaks of refraining from “holding the sensation hostage to your expertise,” of making the experiential felt: “you’re dancing in order to have sensations—you’re looking for where that sensation is in your whole spectrum of dancing.” Dance from the vectors of position where position is already becoming motion, ask “how you might get the most from that closed set of permissible positions: how can I take that movement as far as it can go?”
