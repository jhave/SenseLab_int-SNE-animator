Politics are often perceived as an individual’s relation to the other. Deleuze’s a life is a challenge to such individualized politics. A life foregrounds the force of life—its political potential as an infra-individuating force for a diagrammatic praxis of life-living—at the cusp of individuation where the preindividual is active in all its intensity. A life is power across life, not biopolitical power over life. It is the event of life-living as it emerges on the transindividual threshold of collective individuation. Not of the human per se, not life in this or that precomposed body, but across, with. A life “is precisely what has been stripped of everything that could contain it or represent it” (Palbart 2009, 41; my translation). A life: a force that dephases this life into the more than human where what lives is a tendency for life across its complex relational modalities.
