Transcendence builds memory from without, feeding the past “fullyformed” into the container of the present. To transcend spacetime is to move outside spacetime to force a mode of life on living. Transcendence cleaves morally, separating fields of experience into representations of good and evil. It is a back-gridding procedure that creates a totality, a totalitarian, tautological experience. The transcendental field, by contrast, has no direction except toward the event,and no form in itself—it folds into the event forming.
