Thinking-with is a practice difficult to cite. For it happens in the between of writing, at the thresholds where the work takes on new direction, breathes into consistency, falters. Where the writing thinks beyond where it has been able to think before. It is with this practice of collective thinking that a book begins to take form. Thank you to those who are often invisible in the writing but everywhere felt in the process.
Andrew Murphie, for the ethos that is at the core of your practiceâ€”be it writing, or thinking, or organizing, or publishing. This project was moved by the force of thought you embody.
