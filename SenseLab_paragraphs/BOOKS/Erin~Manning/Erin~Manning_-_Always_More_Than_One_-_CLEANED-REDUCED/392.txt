The shift I make in this chapter is to look more closely at diagrammatic praxis as an experiment in cueing and aligning aimed at directly experiencing the elasticity of spacetime. How does the creation of a diagram morph into a fielding that expands beyond the visual data of space mapped? What happens when the choreographic field does not begin with a preexistent mapping onto which moving bodies are subsequently integrated? How is the moving body (re)created diagrammatically? How does the aligning body morph into a diagrammatic praxis in its own right?
