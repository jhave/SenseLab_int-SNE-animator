The shape of enthusiasm is but one possible shape the drift can take. There are an infinity of ways of articulating the force of an intensive enjoyment that speciates across the organic and the inorganic, an infinity of ways to conceive of the confluence of life and experience. There is an infinite ecology of practices. The shape of enthusiasm is but one way to give a direct vision of the feltness of the exuberance of life-living, its unrestrained, infinitely multiplying orienting that is not a directionality (not an acting-on) but an in-act alive in the driftings of life-livingâ€™s coming-to-expression.
