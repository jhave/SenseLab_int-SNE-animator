That the painting knows, that the more-than of vision is felt through a perceptual field that takes its time before centering-in on an object suggests, perhaps, that powerful artworks are, to different degrees and in differing constellations, autistworks. Artworks, that is, that make felt the more-than of their intensive fielding, that call forth durational traces that exceed the tracing of the already-circumscribed to become the active extinguishing of any concept of the “about.” Autistwork is not about figure or no figure, not about body or no body: it is an experience of with-seeing on a quivering edge that can never know in advance what it will become.
