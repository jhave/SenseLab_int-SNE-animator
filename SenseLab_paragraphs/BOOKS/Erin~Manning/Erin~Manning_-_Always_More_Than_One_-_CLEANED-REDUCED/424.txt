Bring circulation into it. Circulation happens on many scales at once, on different timelines, creating topologies of spacetime. When the dance of attention circulates, it resists stultification into a linear expectation: birthdeath. Activated through multiple contemporary dephasings in a spiraling eternal return, the interval emerges and takes shape as the radically empirical option of life itself or, as Deleuze would say, of a life. A life: the infraindividuation of the force of potential across the surface of life-living.
