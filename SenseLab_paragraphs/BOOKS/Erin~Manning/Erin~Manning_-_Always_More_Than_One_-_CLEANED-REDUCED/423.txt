Procedural intervention into the architectings of mobility involves finding modalities in the event that open the architecting to its more-than such that new speciations, new ecologies, new forms and forces of life can emerge. Take the hospital again. This time, tune its diagram away from the suspension of life to see what happens when lifeâ€™s relation to death no longer frames the event. Go beyond the human and see the more than human coursing in speciations that exceed the mortal body to include different speeds and slownesses that cut across it, infinitely. Care for the human life span but never overlook the potential of the bacterial. Take note of how life-living courses across this event in the making. Play with the procedures this new operative autonomy lays forth.
