Movement cannot be abstracted from the active recall of micromovement as it meets microperception—the intertwining of proprioception and kinesthesia, of past horizontalizings and future unbalancings. When proprioception is challenged,11 or when an accident has caused us to have to relearn to walk, it is this combination—the living memory of the walk walking itself in the walking—that deserts us. A sore ankle can similarly take the habit out of the walk, as can an onset of vertigo. If this happens, we find we not only have to tweak the metastabilities of our incipient movement toward new angles of comfort, we also have to relearn the feeling of walking. We have to relearn the walking of the walk. Memory in the making.
