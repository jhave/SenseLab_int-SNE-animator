The choreographic field is a complex of experience that in itself cannot be mapped. “The resulting structure has a time complexity that . . . could not have been created by any one person, the many simple parts having recombined in unforeseeable ways because of innumerable decisions made by the many involved” (Caspersen 2000, 34). What emerges choreographically is less an organization of bodies than a cartography of incipient tendencies, of force of form. This force of form is not activated by decisions in the standard sense of being willed by the individual.7 Decision here is of the event: it is an activating cut immanent to the process of making movement, a vectoring into contrast by the proposition. Decision in the moving—like thought in the moving—is the event of tendencies colliding such that they coalesce in the time-slip of the new, spurred into invention by the ecology of the dance itself.
