To touch will always of course also mean to handle, to reach across toward the texture of the world in all of its complexity, but its attendant affective quality—to be touched, to touch in the between of words—is ultimately how activation contours are tweaked. From DJ—as from many other autistics—what we can learn is that touch is a worlding that always already participates in the making sense of the world. No laying of hands is necessary for this: to touch is to become attuned to the ecologies of sensation always already activating the world as we embody it, as it embodies us.
