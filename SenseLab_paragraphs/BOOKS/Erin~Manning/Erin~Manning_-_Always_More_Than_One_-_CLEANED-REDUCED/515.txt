When actualized, perception ultimately resolves into an object or a form. The point is not to deny the presence of form but to stage an encounter with the shaping of its more-than. When this occurs, we catch nonsensuous perception in the folding: the direct perception of the half-second of pastness that is already leaking into an experience of the here-now. We feel forward to a memory of the future, an activation in the here-now of the not-yet. For the folds of perception are never linear and never completely actualâ€”they always expose bits of duration that touch on pasts and futures unexplored, creating event-time in the seeing.
