The choreographic proposition generates less the stability of a complex of form than the foregrounding of a field of resonance that defines a certain quality of activity. It serves not to delineate positions or forms from one another in a normative practice of movement notation but to create a diagram that captures, in a fleeting moment, the qualities of movement expressibility such that their force of form can felt.6 Choreography here is concerned with the way movement co-composes with time-felt to create complex ecologies in the register of the more than human. What emerges is less a body moving in time than what I will call a mobile architecture in chapter 5â€”an architecting of spacetimes of experience coemergent with bodies in the making.
