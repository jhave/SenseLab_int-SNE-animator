What is it we really mean when we say “human?” According to autistic Amanda Baggs, we certainly don’t mean “autistic.”1 We mean neurotypical, we mean oriented to interaction with other humans, we mean almost exclusively tuned to human language. “Most people attend to human voices above all else” (Krumins qtd. in Miller 2003, 23).
When the orientation toward the world does not privilege the human voice—or the human face—a diagnosis of “mindblindness” too often ensues. The concept of mindblindness is described by Simon Baron-Cohen as an “inability to develop an awareness of what is in the mind of another human” (1995; my emphasis). For Simon Baron-Cohen and his many followers, there remains the firm belief that when there is limited attendance to the human, when the parsing of the environment does not explicitly focus on the human, what is demonstrated is a failure to be truly human. He writes: “Imagine what your world would be like if you were aware of physical things but were blind to the existence of mental things. I mean, of course, blind to things like thoughts, beliefs, knowledge, desires, and intentions, which for most of us self-evidently underlie behavior. Stretch your imagination to consider what sense you could make of human action (or, for that matter, any animate action whatsoever) if, as for a behaviorist, a mentalistic explanation was forever beyond your limits” (1995, 1).
