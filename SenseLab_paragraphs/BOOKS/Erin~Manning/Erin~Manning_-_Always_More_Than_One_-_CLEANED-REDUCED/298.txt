The work depends on how it comes to collective iteration. In Scattered Crowd, how the room’s volume evolves is synonymous with the quality of event-time created in the moving. The changing of the affective tone of spacetime is not willed by individual participants. It happens in a relational becoming: the room moves the participants to alter the composition of the event’s unfolding in experiential time. Here we see precision of proposition meeting unpredictability of event. To achieve a singularity of experience, the enabling constraints immanent to the proposition have to be both concise and open-ended. When the work works and Scattered Crowd collectivizes around the proposition, the event becomes atmospheric, more ecological than humanor object-oriented, moved in all of its cellular complexity.
