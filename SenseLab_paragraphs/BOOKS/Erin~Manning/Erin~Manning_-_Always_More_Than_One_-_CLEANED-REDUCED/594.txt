Style * “Expressive qualities entertain variable or constant relations with one another (that is what matters of expression do); they no longer constitute placards that mark a territory, but motifs and counterpoints that express the relation of the territory to interior impulses or exterior circumstances, whether or not they are given. No longer signatures, but a style” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 318). Style can never be pinned down to form. It is a mode of existence always intimately tied to the event of its expression, as defined in chapter 6. And yet, as with all modes of existence, there
is a certain consistency to style across occasions. A style can be recognized, in the feeling—we know-feel the languid grace of a cat, the frenzied disappearance of a cockroach, even before we quite see them. Style happens in this “not quite,” in the movement of expression before it takes its form as this or that. Style is always in the moving.
