Despite how haunted we are by the face and its reappearance—especially when we realize that it is the face of Ari Folman, the soldier, filmmaker, memory-driver of the film—the face never sticks. The face does not produce the interiority for the film, does not become the center as the affective image around which the narration turns. It appears and disappears, remaining flat, an impersonal surface that marks the passage from now to now, from singularity to singularity, in a deferred rhythm without preconceived connection, without attachment to time-as-such, without territorializing on a “personal” body. The face resists catharsis.
