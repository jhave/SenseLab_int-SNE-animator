At its best, architecture is a diagrammatic praxis that brings to the fore the force taking form of what Spuybroek calls “an original curve” and defines as the surface of action that is always also the surface of perception (2004, 7). Cues as they actualize in alignment are an example of the bringing into confluence of perception and action. The cue affects the field of action in a perceptual synchronization that moves the body. It catalyzes alignments that themselves create new priming opportunities at the interval where action and perception are one. These alignments return in varied iterations as refrains of activity that territorialize certain systems of perception.
In aligning to cue,10 what catalyzes is the original curve of relational attention. This dance of attention is a collective enunciation of a tendency toward relational resonances rather than individual positioning. Aligning creates resonant territories not only of bodies but of volumes, diagrammatic surfaces in the making, enabling constraints for collective becoming.
