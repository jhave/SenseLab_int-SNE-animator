When the épaulement realizes itself, it momentarily stops becoming. This position is now what it is, and will always remain what it was. A form has unfolded. We are still talking in half-seconds. In Whitehead’s terms, this singular movement—this occasion of experience—has achieved its satisfaction. There is no way to take back exactly this experience of the épaulement and change it. The point is not that there can’t and won’t be an infinity of position-takings and processual becomings in the épaulement’s future, but simply that there can be no continuity of becoming once an event has taken form since the event’s culmination is by definition the end of an episode. As Whitehead states, “There is a becoming of continuity, but no continuity of becoming” (1978, 35).
