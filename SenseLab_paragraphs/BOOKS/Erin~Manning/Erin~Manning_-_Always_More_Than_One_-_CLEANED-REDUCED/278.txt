Choreography is a proposition to movement-moving that asks how the plane of experience composes, how it remembers, how it becomes, and how it takes form, all in the register of the more than human. The focus is not on the body per se. For what moves choreographically is not first and foremost a body. It is rhythm, a cut in duration, a field of resonance, an interval. A choreographic proposition is always about the in-act, about the verge, the force of form that generates position but always, to some degree, exceeds it. It is about the interval, the differential across which a multiplicity of rhythms make up event-time. “What pattern connects the crab to the lobster and the orchid to the primrose and all four of them to me? And me to you?” (Bateson 2002, 8).
