In the orienting toward a concept of life-living where the human is notyet and more-than, Deligny worked to invent techniques for the proliferation of drifts that not only gave the autistics a voice but also gave him a story to tell, a trace to follow. “This is our home beyond nowhere,” writes Jim Sinclair. Beyond nowhere, the more-than of life-living dwells in a shaping that continuously drifts. Beyond nowhere is a line that moves, not running from the world or running the world, but running with it, now-here,17 “causing runoffs. . . . There is no social system that does not leak from all
directions, even if it makes its segments increasingly rigid in order to seal the lines of flight. There is nothing imaginary, nothing symbolic, about a line of flight. There is nothing more active than a line of flight, among animals or humans” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 204).
