There are techniques for hoeing, for standing at a bus stop, for reading a philosophical text, for taking a seat in a restaurant, for being in line at a grocery store. In each case, the technique is both singular and general. There are cultural differences between modes of waiting in line, but all standing in line carries a certain number of general identifiers such as an implicit understanding that only one person can be served at one time. There are of course also techniques in a seed’s germination, in the shift of the Earth’s axis toward the Sun, and in the process of photosynthesis. And there are techniques that build on techniques—techniques for bowing the violin include implicit modes of standing as well as techniques for arm movement or wrist inflection; techniques for painting include implicit modes of seeing as well as techniques for manipulating light or texture; techniques for dance include implicit understandings of equilibrium as well as techniques for locating and moving rhythm and extension.
