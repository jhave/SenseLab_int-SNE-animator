Commons are active in the tracings, and tracings are ubiquitous: “individual or group, we are traversed by lines, meridians, geodesics, tropics, and zones marching to different beats and differing in nature” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 202). Tracings cut as much as they run off. They create no certainty, but they do delimit. Each line has its own modality, and with the drift no doubt come all kinds of rigid segmentarities, language being only one of them. “Supple segmentarity . . . is only a kind of compromise operating by relative deterritorializations and permitting reterritorializations that cause blockages and reversions to the rigid line” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 205). Limits are always already there, even within the lines of drift. They are the affordances that enable the tracings—thickenings of the brush, mountainings of the slope—affordances emergent on the paper as exuberances in their own right. Limits are also thresholds or even barriers—the end of a road, the wall that cannot be scaled. These create the stillings, the diversions, the segmentarity.
