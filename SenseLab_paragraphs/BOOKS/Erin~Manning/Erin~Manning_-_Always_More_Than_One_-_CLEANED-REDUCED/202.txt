This is what Waltz with Bashir does: it complexifies the stakes by resisting the settling of fascism within one or another of the camps; it resists personalizing the political. Go back to the waltz scene, the scene of bullets flying and a soldier dancing, and see once more how the impassive face of Bashir is superimposed onto the agitations of a life. And note how, by superimposing Bashir’s face, enormous and compelling, onto the backdrop of a mad dance of a soldier’s undoing, Waltz with Bashir activates and makes felt the originary difference at the heart of all dephasings. How it makes felt that there is much more at stake than simply one surface of experience. How it makes felt that what surfaces is also how it surfaces.
