Like a choreographer, Deligny’s project in the Cevennes involves a crafting of conditions for the creation of an ontogenetic process of bodying that does not begin with existing form but seeks to create speciations—new forms/forces of live-living. This choreographic process occurs at a locus that is always itself being redefined—not the place of the institution but also not simply the place of the mountains, the place of the locals, the place of the autistics. The locality is itself reorienting—note that Deligny focuses on encampments rather than on a more conventional notion of home or place. The locus of the encounter is both here and more-than here, turning the very concept of place onto itself in an intensive reorienting of the associated milieu of relation. The goal? To make encounter into event, to create the conditions for the emergence of speciations that are made of variations on the milieu. To architect an environment that is potentializing not only for the autistic but for the community as it reinvents itself, to create, as Blanchot might say, a community to come.
