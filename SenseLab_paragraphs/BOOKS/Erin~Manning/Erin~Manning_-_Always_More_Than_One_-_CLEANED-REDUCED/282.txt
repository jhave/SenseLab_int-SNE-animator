From Object to Objectile
Forsythe asks, “Is it possible for choreography to generate autonomous expressions of its principles, a choreographic object, without the body?” (2008, 5). The choreographic object, “a model of potential transition from one state to another in any space imaginable,” is less about the object as such than about the object’s capacity to generate event-time (Forsythe 2008, 6). When an object becomes the attractor for an event, it in-gathers the incipient event toward the object’s dynamic capacity for reconfiguring spacetimes of composition. This is what Forsythe’s choreographic objects are about—creating an emergent constellation for movement experimentation that opens the choreographic to the beyond of dance.
