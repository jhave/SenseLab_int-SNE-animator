Relational art’s call to touch, to play, to encounter an environment in its unfolding, risks failure if its politics of touch are not immanent to the event. Any expectation of touch will always risk including a predetermined understanding of what it means to engage the work. Such a notion of touch will never be able to completely divest itself of its doubling of touch! with do not touch! or touch this way!
The challenge is immense: a participatory work that is successful cannot depend on the mantra of “anything goes” as this will only produce (in the best of all cases) chaos or (in the worst-case scenario) nothing. For a work to be successful, as suggested in the preceding chapter, enabling constraints must be embedded within its conceptual design, and these constraints must to some degree immanently direct the work toward its unfolding. But these constraints must also be capable of remaining flexible enough to refrain from the preposturing of the work (touch it, but get it right! ). To do its work, participatory art must therefore reflect on how it creates the constellations for its unfolding, how it places within the work the expectations that may ultimately close down the very potential the work was meant to unleash.
