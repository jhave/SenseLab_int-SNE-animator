This is not human feeling or emotion. It is affective tonality. It is the generative force, singular to this event, that moves the event toward its resolution. Each occasion has a tone, a singular expressivity, an enjoyment, as Whitehead would say. A life is how the preindividual returns as feeling onto life’s topological surface of becoming.
Whitehead’s notion of feeling is allied to the Spinozean/DeleuzoGuattarian notion of affect, both of which are intimately connected to the concept of a life and to the preindividual. What I like about the concept of feeling is that it reminds us not to place affect within a schema of linear phases and already-formed bodies. Feeling is not attached to a form already-taken, nor is it an afterthought to a preexisting process. Feeling is how an occasion enjoys its coming into what Whitehead calls “subjective form.” Feeling is the force that moves an event to reach its concrescence. Feeling is also what outlives it, always still resonating.
