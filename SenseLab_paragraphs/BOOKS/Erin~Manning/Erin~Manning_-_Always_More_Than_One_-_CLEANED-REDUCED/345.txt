This was a successful event—if participation and enjoyment are markers for success—but it remained at the level of the object. I left this exhibition with a renewed sense of what the object could do but without a sense of having been able to activate an incipient choreography that exceeded the object. The push-pull of a mobile architecture in the making was missing.
