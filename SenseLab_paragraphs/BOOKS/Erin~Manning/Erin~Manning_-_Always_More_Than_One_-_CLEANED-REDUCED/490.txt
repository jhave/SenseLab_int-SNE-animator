The question is not whether autistics are empathetic or relational. The question is how their ethics of relation can be transduced widely and fiercely, as DJ Savarese might say: “Reasonable people promote very easy breathing. Fearful creatures sadden me. Treating me as weird teases the creatures. Testing real justices I’m treated hurtfully. Very interested in freeing justice not creatures. Justice frees my true self. If someone understands that testing kids might make them resentful testing might be stopped. I’m never going to be like anyone else. People need humanitarian approaches to my hurt mind. Unhurt, responsible, persevering, humorous, mighty people are helping my real, mighty, very smart self” (DJ Savarese qtd. in Savarese 2007, 435). Here, as elsewhere, the agitation of collective individuation is palpable: we feel-with the stumblings that life-living provokes, we participate in the welling into formation of the ineffable in the writing even as it communicates across registers, creating new ecologies for expression.
