The challenge here is to understand that regard is not something that flows unidirectionally between the human and the animal. What is happening in the epigraph is the setting into place of a dynamic relation that foregrounds the movement of time, emphasizing how time is itself a dynamic form that recasts how relation is conceived. When Prince writes that “To them, I had never been away, because I had really been there once,” it is of course her interpretation of the event, but nonetheless it sets into motion an interesting provocation to the relational field that continues to be foregrounded in the story Prince then tells about her encounter with Kanzi. I want to suggest that this notion of regard allows us to reposition the ultimate question—“Are you a gorilla?”—away from the interpersonal toward an emphasis on the relational movement that frames the second encounter—“Kanzi and I played chase up and down the fence line, both of us on all fours, smiling in a sea of fun and deep breaths”—where movement itself becomes the way the event has concern for its unfolding.
