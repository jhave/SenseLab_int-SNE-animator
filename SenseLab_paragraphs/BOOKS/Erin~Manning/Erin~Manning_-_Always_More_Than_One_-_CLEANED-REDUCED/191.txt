The biogram of Waltz with Bashir is a moving of preindividual life across the folds of the surface of experience in the making. The becoming-body as biogram plays at the interstice of individuation and singularity, trembling on the resonant circuit of the virtual/actual now of pure experience, appearing as a tonal difference that pushes the narrative along: the body not as content but as crystal of potential. The biogram constitutes not a unique body, but a body-emergent across series, the force of life that can never return to the body as One. Force of life: where life is not yet individual or person but collective individuation. Here, where the actual and the virtual coincide in a tight circuit, there is no morality, there is only life-living, a life. Morality belongs to the discourse of individualized politics where perpetrators and victims are identified not as bodies in the making but as fullyformed nodes of a politics already constituted, a politics that transcends the now of experience.
