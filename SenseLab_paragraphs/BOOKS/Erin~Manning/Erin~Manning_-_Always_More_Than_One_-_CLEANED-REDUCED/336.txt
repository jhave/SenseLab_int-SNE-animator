Participatory ecologies such as Folds to Infinity propose to make felt the mobility of the concept of choreography beyond the collective body of the dancer. For a mobile architecture to emerge out of the process, the proposition, as mentioned above, has to exceed both the object-in-itself and the body-in-itself. Seen as two instances of the same conceptual grouping, the object and the body are anathema to mobile architectures precisely because they delimit the event according to preconstituted interiorities. It is therefore incumbent on the event as it unfolds that all preconstituted constituents be transformed into propositions. In Folds to Infinity, a key enabling constraint to open the object toward its propositional force or prime involves creating modes of access or entry that best incite a collective individuation. If a collective individuation emerges, what can result is the dephasing of the art event into an experimentation with collaboration. In such instances where a transduction occurs that brings art into the field of individuation, what follows is the creation of an incipient choreography. This incipient choreography is inherently collective.
