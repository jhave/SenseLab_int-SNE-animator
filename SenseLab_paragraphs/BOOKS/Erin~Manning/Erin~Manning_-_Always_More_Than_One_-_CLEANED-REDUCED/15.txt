“When you suck your finger,” Stern observes, “your finger gets sucked— and not just generally sucked” (1985, 80). There is no “the” finger-sucking that isn’t inflected by the “how” of “a” sucking. “Which”? “This” one or “that.” And that’s the “what” of it. “Not generally sucked”: a thousandsuckings-of-fingers. No one suck. Where there is one, there are more to come. A one after another.
