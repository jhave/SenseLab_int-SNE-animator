Sheets of the present move at various rhythms, creating different sonorous continuums and affective tonalities, and with them come different resonant fields. Take the scene between the filmmaker and Ori, the friendtherapist.11 In stark departure from the gray-amber-black tones of the earlier scenes of the film, this scene, in which Ori describes a memory experiment, is in greens and pinks. The experiment is as follows: people are shown pictures from their childhood. They figure as children in these pictures and the events are real—they actually happened. Then, the experimenters give them a false image. This image still has them as the protagonist but the environment is invented. They were never really there. As Ori relates the experiment to the filmmaker, the scene shifts to a child in an amusement park, the child like a cutout in a field of clowns and Ferris wheels, all this in bright candy colors (figure 2). This is one such “not really real” image: the amusement park is not one the child ever actually visited. Eighty percent of the people who take this experiment, Ori explains, claim to have really been there when they see themselves in the picture. The remaining 20 percent—those who are unsure of whether they were really there—are invited to go home and think about it. When they return, and upon seeing the picture of “themselves” in the amusement park once again, they “remember” the amusement park. As Ori says, “memory is dynamic, it’s alive.”
