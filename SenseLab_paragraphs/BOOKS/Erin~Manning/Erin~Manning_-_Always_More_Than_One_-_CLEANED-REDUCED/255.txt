Nik Haffner describes a practice session with Forsythe. Haffner is experimenting with a jump he feels isn’t working. He thinks he has the timing wrong. After watching for a while, Forsythe reminds him that it “isn’t the speed of the movement itself, but its stopping, the arrival, the reaching of the new position” that is at stake. Still, the jump continues to be missing something. Forsythe tries a different tack, explaining that “the end of the movement is not a real stopping,” suggesting to Haffner that to execute the movement successfully, he should continue “to think the movement
after the so-called Stop, that [he] should let the movement slowly endlessly grow” (Haffner 2004, 138).
