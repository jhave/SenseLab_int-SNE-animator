Affect is the feeling-vector of individuationâ€™s process as it tunes to its dephasing. It is transformative. And it is collective. It is collective because it is always coincident with the forces that bring it into being and which it activates. It is collective in that it continuously folds individuation into the preindividual, making the force of a life felt in this life. It is collective in that it connects to an ecology before it selects for an individual. Affect is collective because it tunes to a multiplicity of forces already phasing, because it is itself a force of attunement. The collective understood here is not the many parts of the multiplication of discrete bodies. The collective is the multiplicity of a life welling across the topological surfaces of being where the many become one (and are increased by one).
