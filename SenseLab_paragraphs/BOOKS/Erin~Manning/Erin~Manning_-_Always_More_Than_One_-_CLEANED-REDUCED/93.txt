The nexus in Whitehead is the immanent field where the force of eventness can be felt. It is contributory rather than known or experienced as such. What is contributed from the nexus into subsequent occasions is not a given form. The form of the occasion has perished. What remains is the appetition, the force of form. If what drives life is the creative advance always active in the constellation of occasions that make up experience, and experience is always to some degree co-constituted by the nexus of past and contemporary occasions, the nexus can be thought as the relational field
that contributes a more-than to each taking-form. What is reactivated from the nexus into a given occasion is not the form the past occasion took. It is the lure for feeling, the lure for the creativity generated at the heart of difference. For each occasion, as stated above, only emerges as such as the difference in a multiphasing process of individuation. To have emerged as this or that constellation is to have colluded into a dephasing that activated a differential between what was and what will have come to be. Whitehead’s notion of the “creative advance” rests on the understanding that experience is not continuous but composed of differentials and integrations—once more, the becoming of continuity. The creative advance is not novelty in the sense of the “never before” in the capitalist sense of the “newest new.” It is the capacity of an event to activate certain vectors otherwise backgrounded, thereby generating an uneasy field of difference. This field of difference is complex in that it does not deny what it cannot include. To the contrary, it celebrates exactly this fissure, engendering the new out of a resonance of background/foreground. Novelty: less event in-itself than differential of the event in its coming-to-form.
