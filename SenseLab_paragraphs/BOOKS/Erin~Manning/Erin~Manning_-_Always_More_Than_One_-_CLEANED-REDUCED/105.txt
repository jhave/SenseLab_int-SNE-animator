The Outside
Affect does not hold onto being; it activates the threshold that disperses it, always anew. To “threshold” is to create a new field, to propel a dephasing. In its dispersal of being, affect does not undermine the possibility of being. It multiplies it at its collective limit where there is never “one single possible state of being’s achievement” (Simondon 1989, 215). In the collective, it bears repeating, there is no predetermining “I.” Activity keeps the “I” at bay. This does not mean that affect cannot give way to an occasion that resolves into the specificity of an “I,” but that the “I” is the afterthought of a complex affective process that will always nonetheless, to some degree, retain the collectivity at the heart of its having come-to-be.
