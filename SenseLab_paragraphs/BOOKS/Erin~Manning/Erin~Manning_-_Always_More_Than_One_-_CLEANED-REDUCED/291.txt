This experience is specious: it takes us into the time-slip of the event. This speciousness has a quality of fabulation: it enervates us toward the doubleness of time and incites us to invent with time.6 Choreographic objects draw us into this speciousness by infiltrating our experience with the verge of this doubling of time on itself. They also alert us to the processuality of objects. For objects are, like bodyings, more force than form. They are not preorchestrated constellations ready to be taken up into processual experience. They are themselves processes, lures: edgings, tendings, shadowings. They are, as Lygia Clark well knew, relational.7 If these were merely stable objects inhabiting already-constituted space, they wouldnâ€™t have such a hold on us. Objects exist in the between of a proposition and its eventness, inciting co-constellations of movement-moving.
