In the realm of the political, the question of technicity extends to the how of collective enunciation. How is a collaborative event orchestrated? What modes of process are created to ensure that difference can be heard without succumbing to the endgame of debate? How to tweak collective individuation to give the group a voice that allows something to be said that is more-than individual, that carries within it the germs of a multiplicitous individuality? How to operate at the level of collective invention in the tense of the not-yet, at the very edges where thought and practice meet? How to
orchestrate a collective bodying—a society, in the Whiteheadian sense— that crafts its process from the very ecology that constitutes it, that merges technique with the more-than of its potential, finding within technique the implicit force that propels technique toward the excess of form or position? Take the 2009 SenseLab event, Society of Molecules.3 The goal of Society of Molecules was to find techniques that would allow a large group (between sixty and one hundred people) from multiple countries to connect in the creation of an aesthetico-political event. This event was to occur in many countries at once and so would have to work without a gathering in the form of a face-to-face encounter. The problem was how to distribute selforganizing creative energies while operatively interconnecting them at a distance. How to connect not simply at the level of content but also at the level of process?
