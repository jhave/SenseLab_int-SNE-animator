Technique and technicity coexist. Where technique engages the repetitive practices that form a composing body—be it organic or inorganic— technicity is a set of enabling conditions that exact from technique the potential of the new for co-composition. Think the new not as a denial of the past but as the quality of the more-than of the past tuning toward the future. The new is a qualitative difference, already felt in the will-have-been. Time loops. The past now carries a potentiality that was always there but was backgrounded. Its implicit forces are coming to expression in a mutability that will in-form future relational constellations, eventually transducing into technique that which will be reiterable, repeatable. But beyond the technique something else can take place. A setting into eventness of implicit forces creates an opportunity for the coming event’s technicity to express itself. Think technicity as the process that stretches out from technique, creating brief interludes for the more-than of technique, gathering from the implicit the force of form. Think technicity as that which marks the difference in the event of gardening, an event that, on the surface, uses the same techniques whether in November or in May. Think technicity as the field where movement begins to dance. Technicity: the art of the event.
