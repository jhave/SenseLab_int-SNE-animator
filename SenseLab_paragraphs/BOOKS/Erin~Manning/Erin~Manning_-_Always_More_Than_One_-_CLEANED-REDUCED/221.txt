Taking this quote as a starting point, Malka asks: “Levinas, you are the
philosopher of the ‘other.’ Isn’t history, isn’t politics the very site of the encounter with the ‘other,’ and for the Israeli, isn’t the ‘other’ above all the Palestinian?” Levinas responds: “Prior to any act, I am concerned with the Other, and I can never be absolved from this responsibility.” Continuing on the subject of responsibility toward “those ‘who have done nothing,’ ” and focusing on the concept of an “original responsibility of man for the other person,” Levinas underscores the fact that “my self . . . is never absolved from responsibility toward the Other” (Levinas, Finkielkraut, and Malka 1989, 290–91).
