You can think of affect in the broadest sense as what remains of life potential after each or every thing a body says or does—as a perpetual bodily remainder. Looked at from a different angle, this perpetual remainder is an excess. It’s like a reserve of potential or newness or creativity that is experienced alongside every actual production of meaningin language or in any performance of a useful function—vaguely but directly experienced, as something more, a more to come—a life overspilling as it gathers itself up to move on.
