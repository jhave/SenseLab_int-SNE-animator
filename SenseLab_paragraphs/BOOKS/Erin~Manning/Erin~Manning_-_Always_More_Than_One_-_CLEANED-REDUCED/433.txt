Arakawa and Gins’s procedure for life (because it is that, much more than it is a procedure against death) screams once more Nietzsche’s refrain “Was that life? Well then! Once more!” (1966, 157). Reversible Destiny, their procedural  manifesto,  makes  life-living  the  basis  of  an  ethos:  there  is  nothing “more unethical than that we are required to be mortal” (2002, xviii). A politics for life, with life, reversible destiny names life as an event in its own right. It understands life ecologically as the preindividual force of life-living that accompanies all modalities of existence, human and more than human. By  making  life  the  procedural  condition  for event-time,  Arakawa  and Gins enact a politics of performance that is attentive to life-living. That it is a politics of performance makes it no less real and no less viable. Aren’t all politics performative? Arakawa and Gins’s politics: to activate an attentiveness to life that opens life to its associated milieu, to generate a relational matrix  that  attends  to  the  more-than,  to  create  a  mode  of  existence  that activates the potential in procedure that is life-living’s dance of attention. Politics: a tentative attentiveness to the conditions through which an event expresses itself, a tentative constructing toward a holding in place of a distributed relational movement, an attending, in the event, to the how of its deformation.
