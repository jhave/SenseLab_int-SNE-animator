Let’s return to the technique of the work. Autistwork n2 begins on paper. A photograph is photocopied, the photocopier stopped midway, toner still leaking onto the image. In each of the stages, an image is held in abeyance, the paper serving less as a stable matrix for the image than as a thick parchment for what will never quite be seen. “The image has degenerated. But it hasn’t disappeared. You might say instead that it has been caught appearing, bearing degeneracy as a birthmark. Already degenerate, still just appearing: suspended between ages (appearing still)” (Massumi 2006, 1). It’s not that Ettinger hides the originary image—it’s that her technique foregrounds how the bringing to emergence of the work of art must always occur against the grain of preexistent form. This is the work’s technicity: what is painted is force taking-form, not a representation of it (not the image of trauma, for instance). For this feeling of force of form to stand out, the intensity of a trace barely there must catch you before the actual seeing can begin, moving you to a perception that occurs in the before of classification, a before that catches seeing in the making, a seeing where the virtual and the actual coincide, a seeing of the event of tremulousness itself.
