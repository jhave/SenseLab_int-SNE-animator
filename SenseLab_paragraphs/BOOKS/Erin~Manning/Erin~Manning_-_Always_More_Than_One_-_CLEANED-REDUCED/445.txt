Like all bodies, but perhaps more experientially so, the autistics’ body is always already more than one, expressive not in its parts but across the registers of its emergence in co-constituting spacetimes of experience. Relation comes to expression before a body-as-such reveals itself, the body not so much an afterthought or a priori as “with-thought,” implicit in cocompositional emergence. For many autistics the body does not feel precomposed, with preordained roles: it travels, shifting, changing, recomposing with events of experience. “Autism,” writes Tito Mukhopadhyay about himself, “was making him feel that his voice was a distant substance that was required to be collected and put somewhere in his throat” (2002, 52). “My voice comes from my stomach. It is centrifuged” (Mukhopadhyay qtd. in Iversen 2006, 243). For many autistics, it is a real challenge to locate a single organ or limb in a mélange of fields of relation, fields composed of complex networks of sounds, colors, textures, of object-body-environment composites, and bring it to expression through a single predetermined path. It seems almost impossible to subtract from the polyphonous multiplicity of sensation.
