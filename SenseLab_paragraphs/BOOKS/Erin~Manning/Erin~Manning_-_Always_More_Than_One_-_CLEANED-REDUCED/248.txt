Quantifiable time is grasped always from the outside. It is the has-been of an event, measured in retrospect. Event-time, on the other hand, is the feltness of experience in the making. One is measured after the fact, one is felt in the now of movement-moving. Choreography works with both. Quantifying the time of a movement allows for repetition and the setting into sequence of a measurable component of movement technique. Eventtime activates the technicity that opens technique to its more-than. The paradox: the repetition is also to a large degree mired in the qualitative, for repetition will always be a re-creation in time. Each repetition of a movement sequence will requalify the time of the event: the repetition will activate a new time signature for the movement’s duration. Every return to the same will be a return to difference, a spiraling deviation into the multiplying time-slip of event-time. To move is always to activate the time of the event, to feel-with the varying velocities of time’s multiple rhythms. Time, moving us, moving time. No choreography can truly be made to measure.
