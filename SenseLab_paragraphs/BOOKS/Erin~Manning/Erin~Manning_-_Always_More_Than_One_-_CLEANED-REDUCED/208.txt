And then we do see. We see with our own eyes. We see the wailing Palestinian women through the documentary footage taken in 1982. One Palestinian womanâ€™s face fills the screen, growing larger than life, larger even than the space of the frame (figure 10). Then the face moves away from us, into the devastation of the massacre. Now another face looks straight at us, screaming, wailing into the eye of the camera in a language so many of us will never fully comprehend. And in a rush we feel everything, we feel the amplitude of the transcendental surface now active on the surface of life, this life: we feel the terror, the empathy, the guilt, the shame, the horror. Yet we feel it not solely in their name, but in the fullness of our taking part. We feel it as our own movement across the surface of the ineffability of experience. This shift from animation to documentary footage shakes our relation to the image. We feel-see the horror.
