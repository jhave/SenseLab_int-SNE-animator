Every resolution of a process—every actual occasion—carries within itself the more-than of its taking-form. Force is everywhere active, on timelines that intersect with the occasion at hand, and on transversal lines that extend beyond it or circle through it. The force of the preindividual reminds us that life is neither in the individual nor outside it but in what surpasses it while accompanying it. This means that all resolutions—as body, as individual, as object—are more-than the forms they inhabit. A body is always more than one: it is a processual field of relation and the limit at which that field expresses itself as such.
