Spacetimes of relation are never neutral. They are fiery, luminous, scary. They are alive across their resonances, human and nonhuman, modal and amodal. They are attendant and attending, attuning and entertaining. With DJ at the SenseLab, over time we began to collectively attune to how the work did its work, alone and in recombination. We found that even without laying hands on the work, the work was never passive, never still. It was lived in a synesthetic interplay that was mobile and complex, propositional across registers. And we found that it was here, in an approach more ecological than interactive, in a veering from implicit demand, from implicit expectation, that the work began to create play.
