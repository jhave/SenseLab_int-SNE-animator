Bashir’s face is not unexpressive, but nor is it engaged. It looks off into a distance that cannot be fathomed—we cannot see what he sees. Here is a proposition: Bashir’s face creates the initial delimitation of a territory. This territory is where the massacre will take place: it is a specific place with a date and a history and an aftermath. Bashir gazes toward the macropolitical, his gaze directed toward the transcendent unity that is the State, the unity from which he derives the power to make decisions such as who is included and excluded from the realm of the political. And yet his face is not there—it is here, here in the dance, here in the vertigo where the macro and the micro coincide, where the affective tonality of a life coursing through this life makes itself felt.
