The body, a haecceity: the thisness of experience active as a singularity in the dephased now. Not individual but individuation. Not subject but collectivity, differential on the edge where the force of life meets life itself. Not the body after the subject. Not the body caught in the trap of hylomorphism where the individual is considered as created by “the meeting of a form and a matter” (Simondon 1989, 9, 11).6 But the body before the subject, in advance and always toward subjectivity (rarely there), the body as transindividuation, the body as resonant materiality, the body as the metastable field before the taking-form of this or that. The body, always more than one, replete with the force of life, “life of pure immanence, neutral, beyond good or evil, since only the subject that incarnated it in the midst of things made it good or bad” (Deleuze 2007, 391). The body, more assemblage than form, more associated milieu than Being.
