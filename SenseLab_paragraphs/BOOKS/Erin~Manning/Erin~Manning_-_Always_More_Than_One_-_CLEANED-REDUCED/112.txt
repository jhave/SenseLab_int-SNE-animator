What is infinite is the body’s appetition, not its form. “It is possible that something of the individual be eternal, and that it reincorporate itself, in some way, in the world with respect to the individual” (Simondon 1989, 102). What lives on, what is immanent to life as expressive potential, exceeds this or that body. Simondon calls it “holes of individuality,” which he defines as “veritable negatives of individuals composed of a core of affectivity and emotivity” (1989, 102). What lives on is never the subject, never the individual. What lives on is affective resonance.
