The alternative adopted by Manning is neither to deconstruct nor decenter, but to defer. The speed with which she launches into process is designed to hold at bay the issue of the status of the subject and the object until concepts for the reciprocal presupposition of the one and the many are sufficiently in place for subject and object to be grasped as a function of process rather than the reverse: process falling under the province of subjects and objects. The concept charged with holding the status of the subject and object in processual suspense is individuation, adapted from Gilbert Simondon. Simondonâ€™s premise is simple: individuals, whether subjects or objects according to the traditional categories, come to be. They are results of an ontogenetic process: they are products.
