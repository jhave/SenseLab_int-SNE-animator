To create play is not as simple as to touch. Perhaps for the neurotypical, touch is as immediate an entry into the relational as we can, in the first instance, conceive of. But all participatory work, to be successful, must get beyond this first injunction. The work must carry within its concept the conditions for play that can propel the participant toward the more-than of touch where the activity of the work in its eventness can be felt, where the work’s already attuning relational potential affects what a body-worlding can do. Seen this way, there is no work that isn’t already potentially participatory, be it a painting, an architecture, an installation, a musical composition. The challenge is to create the conditions for the work to work in an ecology of relation that does not privilege the interactive but seeks to open the way for the activation of the more-than the work has to offer.
