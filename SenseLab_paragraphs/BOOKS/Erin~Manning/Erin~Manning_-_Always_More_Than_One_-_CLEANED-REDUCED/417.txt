The outcome is never stated in advance. Conditions are set into place for the event’s activation, not toward a preplanned resolution. These conditions involve the event’s terminus, as James would say, the “end in sight” that activates the event without necessarily becoming the promise of a predetermined goal.5 Terminus as that which gets the action underway, as that which in-forms the event without preempting an outcome. Terminus as that which captivates the process and propels a dephasing that results in the nowness of this or that occasion. Terminus as that which activates the distributed relational movement of the event in its concrescence. That which propels a transduction. Terminus: the realization that step 1 is already a memory of step 10 infradimensionalizing.
Return to the exercise for diagrammatic praxis. You are lying on the ground and the diagram is in-forming, multiplying angles and lines, forces and tendencies. As the second diagram begins to emerge—the diagram for movement-bodying—the first diagram does not externalize: it intensifies. The two diagrams infra-individuate into a dimensionalizing that is more feeling than form. We have not a doubling of form, but an intensive multiplying of infradimensionality in the moving. The terminus that activates a procedure does not create a precomposed map, it potentializes the map.
