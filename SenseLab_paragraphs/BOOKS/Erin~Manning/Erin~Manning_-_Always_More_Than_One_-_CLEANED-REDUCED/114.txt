Affect promises nothing. It creates across and beyond good and evil. It activates. It does not conserve. It creates life, but not solely among the living. Collectivizing, it propulses individuation at the between where all projects are most volatile, where societies falter, where the actually living intersect with the already-undead of lifeâ€™s immanent surface. Always more than one, affect activates the holes of individuality that animate a life.
