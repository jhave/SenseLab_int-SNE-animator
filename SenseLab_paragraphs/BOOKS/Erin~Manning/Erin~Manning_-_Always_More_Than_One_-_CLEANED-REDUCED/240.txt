How a task or technique becomes propositional is a key question. Drop a curve is a task insofar as it creates a field for the questioning of how movement is generated in the image of a curve dropping. It is propositional when it activates a tonality that alters the way a body-ecology can move. In the Forsythe Company, many propositions begin as tasks, and, as such, they cannot be abstracted from the many hours of technique that feed the companyâ€™s complex movement lexicon. The necessity of technique should not be underestimated: technique is what allows the ecology of movement to open itself to its generative potential. But technique is not enough. Drop a curve becomes propositional precisely when it becomes capable of activating the beyond of technique. It becomes a proposition when it begins to exceed the technical, making operable a kind of bodying that is unforeseen (unpracticed) but available from within the register of the movement that will have preceded and followed it.
