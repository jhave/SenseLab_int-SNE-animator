Counterpoint is creative. It proposes an assemblage and this assemblage is always, to a degree, a territorializing platform. But what counterpoint also does is keep that territory moving, active, transductive. For counterpoint activates the associated milieus of the territory, the milieus that cross through it and are always, to some extent, in excess of it. This is the paradox of counterpoint: it must remain territorial to the degree that it can be accessed and returned to. But what is returned to is always, to a certain degree, difference. The field of counterpoint is dynamic, its movements local insofar as they co-constitute the singular expression of emergence their in-concertness calls forth, and global to the degree that they can be recaptured for future events in the making. Counterpoint produces not positions as such, but the more-than of position on its way to activating times as yet unseen, unfelt. Positions outdoing themselves, in concert.
