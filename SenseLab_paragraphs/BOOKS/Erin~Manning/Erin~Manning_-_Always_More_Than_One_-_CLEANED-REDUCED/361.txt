Folds to Infinity is not a neutral materiality that is added onto the performative. The fabric, the magnets, the architectureâ€”each of these activates orientations that affect how the piece itself generates spacetimes of experience. As a choreographic object, it is always and only what it does, here, now. This means that each iteration of the work will reorient what the work can do. Nothing can be taken for granted. Participatory art cannot be conceived to template: every participant will affect how the work unfolds, and each unfolding of the work will make demands on how the work evolves for the next iteration. No matter how many times a piece has been exhibited, no matter how successful it has been in this or that context, no matter how many evolving techniques have been woven into the work to facilitate its structured improvisation, there is no guarantee that the conditions of this particular enunciation will unfold the piece in predictable (or interesting) ways. There is simply no guarantee with work that depends on participation for its unfolding.
