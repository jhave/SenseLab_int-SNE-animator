A speciation is not, as such, organic. It is not made up of separately definable human and animal components in a metonymic relation to an organic whole. This very idea of the organic whole is a misnomer: both “body” and “species” are general categories that can only be conceived as such by divesting them of the relational field that co-constitutes them.7 To posit such a notion of the whole is to have separated out the event of bodying from its activity. Speciations are how to think this activity, the in-act of body-world constellations in all their organic and inorganic intermixings. These in-acts are not strictly physical—they are a conglomeration of physicalities with affective tonalities that emerge from the very necessity of the milieu: it is the milieu that fashions them. Speciations body in the event of their direct co-relation to the event, they are not body-species pre-formed and are never finally formed—they are bodyings. An event has concern for the bodying. And there is no body that is not infinitely more than one.
An autonomy of expression is at work in the relational field speciations call forth. We are not talking of relations that exist outside of the event of their emergence. The relational field of movement-moving activates the distributed field in which the dancers dance, and in the dancing, they move with it, aligning to it, moving it. The field expresses, the field dances to attention, not the dancers as individuals. And what it expresses is a relational movement that exceeds the terms of the dancers’ individual bodyness, bringing into complex constellations a rhythm that in-forms the speciations their movement-moving creates.
