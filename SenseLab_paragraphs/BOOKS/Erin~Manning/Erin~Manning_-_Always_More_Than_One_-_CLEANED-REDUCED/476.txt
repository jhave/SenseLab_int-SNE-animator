For Baggs the frustration with patterns as regards language is their “untranslatability.” She writes: “Words are forming at the surface / While in here they make no sense / Patterns forming losing meaning / No way still to comprehend / Standing in the shattered fragments / Language falling all around.”27 Patterns cannot be translated because they are not yet articulated within structures of meaning. They are affective tonalities on the cusp of articulation. Pushing pattern prematurely into language causes the intense disturbance of “sense” Amanda Baggs foregrounds, with “language falling all around,” conspicuously incapable of making sense of the ineffable morethan. And yet, as autie-type demonstrates, there is also more to language, a more-than that can bring into act the very complexities we all tend to find difficult to express in words.
