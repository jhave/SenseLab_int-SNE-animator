This is not to say that creative advance is active all the time under all circumstances. It is to emphasize the fact that the force of appetition and thinking-feeling are always present in germ and contributory in the dynamic form of events concrescing. Whitehead writes: “The quality of an act of experience is largely determined by the factor of the thinking it contains” (1929, 80). As soon as a process falls into general categories, its capacity for creative advance is stunted, for general categories don’t think. Creativity is always in the dynamic details of a process. These details are played out at the level of the emergent occasion in the constellation of the event. They are its speciations, its technicities, its overarticulations, its preaccelerations. They are the event’s more-than. This is where the thinking-feeling happens, in the in-act of the event’s outdoing of form, in the in-act of the event’s outdoing of simple location. Movement-moving.
