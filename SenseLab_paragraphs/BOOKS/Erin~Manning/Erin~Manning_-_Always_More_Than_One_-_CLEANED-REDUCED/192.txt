“Bare activity” is the term Brian Massumi gives to the politics-in-germ of the becoming-body. Politics-in-germ bubbles on the preindividual level as the singularly-felt edging into life-living of the body-becoming. Bare activity is not biopower. It is the biogrammatic tendency of an edging into bodyness, of the surface welling into a singularity across series. “Biopower’s ‘field of application’ according to Foucault is a territory, grasped from the angle of its actually providing liveable conditions for an existing biological being. [Bare activity] operates on a proto-territory tensed with a compelling excess of potential which renders it strictly unliveable” (Massumi 2009a, 167). On the edge of the liveable: a life.
