As the opening scene gives way to future amber-gray-black scenes of memory and forgetting, we become somewhat distanced from the horror of the dogs. But the dogs have set the tone and we cannot but feel that, in the end, there is no distance, no break in the movement-across, only the semblance of a strange, detached calm.16
This uneasy movement between surfacings, topological and horizontal, between affective tonalities, lull and anguish, between calm and agitation, terror and beauty, is active, always, in the contrast, amber-gray-black. The amber-gray-black is a backdrop that is never strictly a background, forcing the viewer into a continued seeing-feeling across strata: we are drawn into a backgrounding-foregrounding resonance, we are lulled by the warmth of the amber but cannot tear ourselves away from the nightmare of the inky black, the threatening night sky, the destroyed world of gray asphalt. And so with each return of the amber-gray-black, a version of the dogs returns, their eyes amber, their fur gray, the sky amber, the streets gray, their sound amber-gray-black, the sonorous continuum resonant on the mobile surface of the imagescape.
