Too often, cues and primes are associated with a stable notion of recall. In Forsythe’s One Flat Thing, reproduced, despite the emphasis of timed cueings and alignings associated with specific dancing bodies, there is no such simplistic notion of a repetition of the already-formed. The “reproduced” of One Flat Thing, reproduced connotes the repetition with a difference that is at the heart of each of Forsythe’s stage-based choreographies. The cue functions not as a simple tool for the memory of a rehearsed past, but as a call toward the future. Responding to cue is at once realigning and priming to future realignments.
