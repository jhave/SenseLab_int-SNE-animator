This scene briefly takes us “out” of the story of war. An aside on memory, it feels like a film within the film. We relax in the assumption that we are pausing outside the atrocities of war while we are being taught a lesson about the slippery quality of memory so that when we return to the “real” film, we will expect less from the “truth” of recollection. But just when we are certain that this is simply an academic exercise into the inevitability of memory’s failures, and that this scene is cast apart from the real events of the film, the scene itself begins to fabulate: a washed-out version of the amusement park scene briefly becomes the backdrop to Ori and the filmmaker’s conversation, the Ferris wheel and the hot air balloon appearing in the window behind the filmmaker’s back (figure 3). The amusement park has made its way onto the surface of the now, into the story of how war and memory can never strictly coincide. Memory has already begun working its sly tricks. The force of fabulation has once more infiltrated the transcendental field of the film.
