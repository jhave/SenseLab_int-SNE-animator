What makes autistic perception so valuable for the rethinking of experience is the process of shaping, or the complexity of what Anne Corwin calls “chunking.” Anne Corwin writes: “I often tend to sit on floors and other surfaces even if furniture is available, because it’s a lot easier to identify ‘flat surface a person can sit on’ than it is to sort the environment into chunks like ‘couch,’ ‘chair,’ ‘floor,’ and ‘coffee table.’”12 All perception involves chunking, but what autistics have access to that is usually backgrounded for neurotypicals is the direct experience of the relational field’s morphing into objects and subjects. Experientially speaking, there is never—for anyone— the direct apprehension of an object or a subject. What we perceive is always first a relational field. It is a key contribution of Whitehead to have created a whole philosophical vocabulary of process to make this clear. Still, given the quickness of the morphing from the relational field into the objects and subjects of our perceptions, many of us neurotypicals feel as though the world is “pre-chunked” into species, into bodies and individuals. This is the shortcoming, as autistics might say, of neurotypical perception (that we are simply too quick to chunk), and it is certainly one of the things that makes many autistics feel lost in a world overtaken by normopaths.
