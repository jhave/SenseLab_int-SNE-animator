As demonstrated by Forsythe’s work on choreographic objects, the what else of the choreographic can be activated in an infinity of constellations. From an eddy to a flock of Canada geese to movement propositions such as Scattered Crowd to the constellation of a social movement, the what else of choreography emphasizes that choreography is a proposition not for the body itself but for the relational force of movement-moving in an ecology of life-living. In this chapter, I propose the concept of “mobile architectures” as another way of conceiving the choreographic when it becomes an event not for the individual body but for the ontogenetic architecting of environments in the moving.
