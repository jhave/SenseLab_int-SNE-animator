Style connects with the event’s affective tonality. It is movement quality carried forth into an event through the force of its reactivation from relational field to relational field. It is chiefly nonsensuous, as Whitehead would say, activating for the event a certain quality of past occasions. This quality is always a renewal of itself for the present occasion. Style is therefore never quite the same for two occasions. A moving-body’s expressivity will carry the force of an attunement that can be aligned to. This aligning will express a certain style that can be connected, transversally, to other events of its kind. A movement, Forsythe-like. The how of the aligning as style is not a question of connecting to a certain superficial quality but of moving with the movement’s movement so as to captivate the movement’s very potential for expression. Moving gorilla-like.
