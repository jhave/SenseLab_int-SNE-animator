Waltz with Bashir is a political drama whose strength is that it plays itself
out at the uneasy intersection of a life effervescing and politics’ potential reterritorialization on the face of fascism.31 Waltz with Bashir refutes an easy solution. There is no promise here, nor even the certainty that it isn’t fascism that rears its ugly head as the film comes to a close. Yet it is also here, it seems to me, in the uncertainty, that the potential looms for something yet to come that has not yet found its name, its face: a politics-in-the-making. In providing us with the opportunity to think the how of protopolitics, Waltz with Bashir calls forth the future, but not a readymade one. An uncertain one. In doing so, it resists territory’s refrain, creating the opportunity for an ongoing conversation across surfaces of war and violence, an ongoing conversation not only about past wars or ongoing massacres, not only about the ineffability of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its microand macrofascist tendencies, but also about the danger of “new forms of microfascisms: the simmering of familialism, at school, in racism, in ghettos of all kinds” (Guattari 1977, 62; my translation).
