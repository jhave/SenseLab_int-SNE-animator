This is the minima at work, a restless not-yet of the painterly in a painting that prevents you from seeing solely in the form of the actual. To see here is to see-with, beyond the seeing-as-such. What we perceive is an exuberance of form, an uneasy pairing of an image abstracted and an experience to come.
