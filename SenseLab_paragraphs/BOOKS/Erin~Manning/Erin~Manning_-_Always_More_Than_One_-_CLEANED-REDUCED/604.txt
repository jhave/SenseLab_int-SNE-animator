“Play is the abstractive suspension of a vital context” (2011c, 87). It bursts open the frame of expectation. It intuits, activating a consciousness not of, but with—a regard in the playing that defies the extraction of movement from the event at play. This regard creates incipient territories never before moved in the playing. Not “are you a gorilla?” but “how do you move me?” or better, “how does our movement move us?” Play as the bringing into focus of an affective force of relation that reinvents, in its small way, the relational how of life-living. A constellation-machine for movementinvention and for time-looping. Counterpoint.
