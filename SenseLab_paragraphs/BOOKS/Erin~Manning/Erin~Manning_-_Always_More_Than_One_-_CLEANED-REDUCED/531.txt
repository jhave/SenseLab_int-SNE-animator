The more-than, the beyond of representation, the knowing-with, this we might also call love—“love the anonymous elements” (Ettinger 1993, 65). Love as the more-than where feeling achieves its final escape from the subject. Love as the fielding of the agitation-that-worlds in an ecology of movement. Love as the force that architects a mobility without preimposed direction. Love as a sense of encountering what we thought was delimited—is that me?—again, differently. Love as the crafting, in a relational effortlessness, of an event of generosity that occludes any notion of the “I”—is that you? Love as the expression of how the bounded me never was and never will be. Love as the spark that shapes an enthusiasm that forever exceeds us. Love has no subject. It is where the object never was. Love is more than human: it courses across the human, across life in all its material and incorporeal ecologies, touching on the folding of the world bodying. Love: that which catches the more-than of feeling in the edging toward perception and incites a landing that never quite sites. Does the me ever return? Only
as an afterthought.
