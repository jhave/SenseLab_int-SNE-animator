Autistworks create not form but a certain intensive shaping, a shaping that brings to the fore a force-field of potential that gives a singularity to the emergent. What autistworks shape is never preexistentâ€”this is an immanent shaping in the not-yet of experience tuning toward the thisness of actual perception. Autistworks shape insofar as they intensively delimit by inflecting, creating not form but tendency.
