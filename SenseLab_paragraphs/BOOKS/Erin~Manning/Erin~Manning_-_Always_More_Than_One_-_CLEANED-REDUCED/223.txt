This is precisely what Waltz with Bashir resists: nowhere in the film is there a reterritorialization on the face of the other. By the time the Palestinian women’s faces appear, it can no longer be a question of territory, the surfaces far too intermeshed. Waltz with Bashir thus resists the two tendencies at play here in the bringing together of ethics and politics: the staging of the politico-ethical solely in the body of the human and its responsibility for the other it faces. Responsibility for reeks of benevolence, a dangerous kind of liberal humanist “generosity” that maintains the other as either victim or perpetrator, keeping the strata rigid. Being responsible before is a different proposition. To be responsible before is to engage at the nonhuman limit of the barely active where a life is restlessly agitating. On the cusp where the surfaces of life-living resonate, on the sonorous continuum of the ineffable, responsibility before means that we cannot already have positioned ourselves, that we are indeed, as Deleuze suggests, sorcerers creating life, and more life.
