The interval is felt in the ways in which it contributes to the experience in act. In its contribution, what it does is not to instantiate an open-ended becoming. It stimulates and intensifies tendings already in germ in the event’s concrescence. The interval cannot be separated out from the in-act. Yet, while it is never known as such, there is no denying it has a lived effect. It makes a difference.
The becoming of continuity can never be separated out from the idea of contrast, for it is contrast that ultimately creates resonances not only in but also between actual occasions. The becoming of continuity might therefore also be called the becoming of difference. It involves moving with the differential of the occasion’s time signature, keeping the difference in the moving, creating a continuity out of movements’ dephasings, while never discounting the important tension between form and fold, form and force.
