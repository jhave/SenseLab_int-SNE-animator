Such a way of life is not economical, not tuned to the quickness to which we are accustomed in a world where there remains the presupposition that form precedes force and image precedes shape. “Unless your brain is unusually wired, I doubt you have ever—even in infancy—perceived things the way I most readily perceive them” writes Baggs (2010a). “I don’t doubt that this is the reason most people view my way of perceiving the world as an empty hole rather than every bit as rich and beautiful as their own.” Autistic perception dances the environment, folding-through a seeing-feeling that does not delimit in advance the realm of experience. “My experiences have their own richness that other people may not be able to see, and they are far more than a mere lack of movement, conventional thought, speech, language, or perception. . . . As someone whose cognitive and physical abilities vary widely from day to day, and moment to moment, I know that this richness is just as present when I lack the capacity to differentiate one sensation or moment from another as it is when I am engaging in complex thought” (Baggs 2010a).
