Take the event of a ray of sunlight that alters the color of the kitchen wall
on a sunny early morning. Usually, the wall is light yellow. But this morning the wall is luminous, lighting up the kitchen in a way that exceeds this or that definite color. It is still yellow, but it is also more-than yellow—how to define it? A yellowness? This musing on color is instantaneous. It is not a reflection on color but an immediate feeling activated by the event of the light. Certainly, it can later be reflected upon, and the experience can subsequently shift, but what will result from this reflection will always have been another occasion of experience. The specific and singular first experience of luminousness cannot be altered. Once felt it cannot become what it wasn’t. This is the paradox: the occasion is absolute in its singularity and infinitely contributory, as quality or haecceity, in the excess of what it will have been.
