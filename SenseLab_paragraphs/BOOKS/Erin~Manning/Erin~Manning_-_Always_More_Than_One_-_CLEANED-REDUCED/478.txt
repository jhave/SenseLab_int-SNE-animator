This coming-to-expression cannot be reiterated exactly the same way twice: its quality of more-than will remain in act.28 There is no adequate verb tense for thought. Thought is the immanent articulating-with of feeling in-forming. It is the more-than of language in the making, a future pastness that conditions the opportunity for expression on a different register. Thought prearticulating in the fullness of its agitation is what we taste when we hear Bissonnette’s words—“Without art, wafting smells of earth’s pleasures would kite away to land of inanimate objects, so it’s past point of personal hobby.” Thought is a patterning, a “rich and varied form of communication in [its] own right, not [an] inadequate substitute for the more standard forms of communication” (Baggs 2010a). Thought, as Baggs (2010a) suggests, “take[s] place so quietly they can barely notice it’s there,” activating, with the force of immanent relationality, “the much more direct relationships, connections, and patterns formed between one thing and another.” These “quiet thoughts,” as Baggs calls them, are distinct from “loud over-thoughts” that precipitate experience toward the realm of expectation, the realm of content, the realm of the alreadysaid. Quiet thoughts are forces for the thinking-with, forces that move a body-worlding, that open the more-than to a perception in the making that always exceeds its own framing. Thought is the withness of the objectenvironment-milieu beckoning in a feeling-with that co-composes the animate and the inanimate across complex scales of experience. The resonance of this composition—its vibrancy—is the how of thought-thinking.
