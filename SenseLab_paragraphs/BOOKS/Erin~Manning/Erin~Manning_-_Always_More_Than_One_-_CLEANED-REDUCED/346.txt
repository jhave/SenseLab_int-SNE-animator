And so I began work on Volumetrics, Phase 2 of Folds to Infinity. And as I did so, I realized that at the McCord Museum I fell into my own trap: I created a structure. And the very same structure remained at the end, denuded but not transformed. We must never underestimate the power of existing structures to predetermine the proto-architectural field.
