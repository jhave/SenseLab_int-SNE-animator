Through individuation-dephasing-transduction, where formative force becomes form to become force once more, the singular event of a formtaking can never be fully abstracted from the processes from which it has emerged. Dephasing activates a strange commingling between the thisness of a process culminating and its continued relational potential as regards other processes. What we know as “a body” is the relational node that culminates as a unity and as the difference of a complex process’s contemporary phasings. A body is continuity and emergent discontinuity—a remarkable point in the becoming of continuity. We know it as such for how it has not persisted in the complex of processes of which it is part.
