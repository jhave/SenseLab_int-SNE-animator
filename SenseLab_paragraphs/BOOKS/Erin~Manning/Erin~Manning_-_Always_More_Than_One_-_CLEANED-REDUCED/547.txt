Anything that does not immediately conform to the superficial content of what has been defined as the norm now falls into the more unstable field of the pathological (the sick, the other, the less-than-human), which in effect, creates not only a paradoxical pathologization of the individual as such (who never really existed in any stable and reiterable way in the first place) but the more widespread pathologization of experience itself. The pathologization of experience then works to subtract from experience the ineffable more-than, for there is no place for the more-than in an ideology of rationalization or progress or survival or cure (whatever the leading by-line of the time). This not only disqualifies all that does not resemble it—it wrests experience of its incipiency, violently seeking to undermine the complexity of life-living’s processual shaping.
