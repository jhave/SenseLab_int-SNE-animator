The transcendental field in Waltz with Bashir expresses itself as the emergent surface that is the repeated and varied contrast of amber-gray-black. This contrast is felt as a field of resonance where color becomes sonorous continuumâ€”its surface the rhythm for the seeing-hearing of a life coursing through. While the amber-gray-black returns, always, in moments of recollection, it is not the content of the scenes that feeds forward from the transcendental field but the quality, the rhythm, the resonance, of the imagescape itself. The imagescape pulses through, pushing forward and across, moving us with it, resonating with the unseen, the ineffable, the forgetting at the heart of memory, the forgetting at whose limit life begins to bubble to the surface.
