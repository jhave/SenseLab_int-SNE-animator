What emerges as a dance of attention cannot be replicated. It is not a thing, a form. Attention dances in the between of diagrams in-forming. Attention is its own emergent choreographing. We feel attention’s dance, but it is not of us or even for us. It is with, in the milieu. It is what we connect to when we feel the procedural pull of the event’s magnetism, its overcoming of posture, form, figure, its outdoing. It is how we feel the work working. For when attention dances, the ground begins to move, and in the moving, we are moved.
