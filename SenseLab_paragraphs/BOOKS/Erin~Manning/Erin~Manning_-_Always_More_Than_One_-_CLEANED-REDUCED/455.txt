Feeling-with implies that the event has a concern for how it comes to emergence. Autie-type takes this concern for the event in its emergence to heart: the writing never seems to be separate from the ethics of relation it calls forth. This ethics of relation is the attentiveness, in the event, to its relational matrix, to the how of its composition, making language the beckoning field of what a feeling has felt, expressing this feeling in a modality that remains, even while fully intelligible, quasi-ineffable.
What is significant about autie-type is that autistics come to this kind of poetic writing intuitively. It is not learned or honed. The affective tonality that runs through it seems to be distinctively linked to the direct perception of the more-than experienced in everyday life. They write autistic perception. As Ralph Savarese writes: “With Tito, language steps lightly, provisionally; it neither masters nor replaces the object it names” (Mukhopadhyay and Savarese 2010). Rather than undoing itself completely of the complexity of the ineffable of what William James calls pure experience— experience at the very edge of the actual where it still resonates with virtuality—autie-type makes it felt. Rather than disconnecting from the field of relation, it bridges it, conceptually, propositionally. This allows autistics to bring to expression the complex subtleties of the dance of attention that is at the heart of all incipient becomings. To bring this dance of attention to articulation is probably the biggest challenge any writer will face, as language invariably involves a certain sum of representation. To write-with language in the making is to dance-with experience rather than to exclude it from the dance.
