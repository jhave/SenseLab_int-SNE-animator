What makes this exuberance felt? What prevents the abyss from dovetailing into a nothingness thick with the pain of a memory always out of reach, of time disjointed? It’s the red in the vertical doubling of red and purple that courses up from the bottom right of the canvas, cutting into the central vortex. A red line moving from the bottom up, shifting into a shadow of itself, purple verticality. In fact it’s less the red line itself than it is the quality of redness that shifts the perceptual field. Redness is here less a color or the form of a trace than it is a line of force—or what Ettinger might call a “color-line-light”—that intercepts the traumatic infolding of the work by unmooring it, by startling the painting back to the surface. This redness provokes the centrifuge of perception in-the-making. A color-line because the line reverberates with color’s intensity, a color-line-light because it is not color or line we ultimately perceive, but light. A light beyond the seeingas-such.
