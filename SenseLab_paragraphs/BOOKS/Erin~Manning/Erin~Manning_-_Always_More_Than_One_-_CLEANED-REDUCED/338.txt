With this in mind, we set up a single initial entry point into the large space so that all participants would be funneled toward the far left of the installation where the darker colors—greens and browns—congregated on and around sculptures beckoning to the wider constellation. Upon entering into this secondary arena, participants had three options. They could move into the space in the most direct manner, which would siphon them toward the greens, from whence they would likely wander into the far side of the room where tones of orange gave way to a large orange velvet couch where they could comfortably sit and view the unfolding of the event from a safe but still enfolding distance. Alternately, they might be attracted to the open center of the space where all colors came together. A move in this direction, however, rather than giving immediate access to the central space of the installation, landed the participant in front of a warped transparent screen hanging at eye level.
