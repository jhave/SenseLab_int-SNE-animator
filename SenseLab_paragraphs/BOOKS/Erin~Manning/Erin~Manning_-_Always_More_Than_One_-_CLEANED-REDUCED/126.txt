Technicity is the associated milieu of technique. If technique is the learning of a certain kind of reach, a certain kind of pull or turn or spiral, if technique is the sounding of a voice or the rhythmic assertion of a step, technicity is the operational field of its expressivity. This field is co-imbricating. It is a lively interval, energized with all of the forces of movement-moving. The role of technique in the field of technicity is to create the potential for a singularity of forms to mutate toward a generative process. Technique is key because of its rigorous method of experimentation and repetition, a method that allays any passivity in the passage from the form of experimentation to its force. Technicity—the associated milieu where form once more becomes force, where individual gesture becomes individuation—is the process through which the implicit is acted upon to generate something as yet unthought.
