Think the body as an ecology of operations that straddles the flesh of its matter and the environmentality of its multiple takings-form. From such an environmentality retain the idea of technique. Think technique not as an add-on to a preexisting body-form but as a process of bodying. Think technique as an in-forming of a mutating body. And then think that body as a field of relations rather than a stability, a force taking-form rather than simply a form. See technique as the mode through which a body can express, aligning into this expression qualities of its bodying (aspects of its motor tendencies, aspects of its existing experiential matrix). Make it, as Deleuze and Guattari would say, a body without organs. Make it more-than its biological organization.
