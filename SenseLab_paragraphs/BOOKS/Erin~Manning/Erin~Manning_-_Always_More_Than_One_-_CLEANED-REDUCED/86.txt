Life is always about a double-capture—on the one hand, it is the force of life-living that exceeds this or that life, and on the other, it is the monadic
event of a singular set of conditions in momentary collusion. Life is always between. Too often, life is conceived as that which frames the alreadyconstituted—life as human, life as organic. Life as defined here in no way privileges the human. Nor is it constituted as an envelope for experience. Life is life-living, in act, replete with the indefinable force of a life coursing through it. Life is a complex of feeling, an ecology not reducible to its data, to its content or its form-takings. Life is the plurality of becoming as felt, a plurality not of many parts—this would place the plural below the category of being—but a plurality at the very level of becoming, a multiplicity in act.
