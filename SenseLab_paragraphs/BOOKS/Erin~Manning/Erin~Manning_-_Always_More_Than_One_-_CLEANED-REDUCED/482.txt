Language operates in an ecology that includes at once the realm of attention in the event, expressibility, expression, and comprehension. These cannot be abstracted from one another. Language is the collective individuation of sense across strata of intelligibility and inexpressibility. It is not “about”—not about the individual, about being, about sensation, about experience—it is sensation in the forming, between the words. “Signification is not being but between beings, or rather across them: it is transindividual” (Simondon 2005, 307).
