For an artwork to be an autistwork, it will have to create itself beyond its content, beyond the subject of its iteration, beyond the linear determinations of its history. It is not that these will have no bearing on it—the photocopier will always have left its withdrawing trace on Autistwork n2 as will the Holocaust, the family, the mother—but that the work will always have to beckon to the beyond of its genesis.
