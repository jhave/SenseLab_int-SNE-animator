Technique comes out of practice as much as it is what goes into practice. In this regard, techniques are hard to come by—they demand the patient exploration of how a practice best comes into itself. Technicity is the dephasing of technique—it is the experience of technique reaching the more-than of its initial application. Technicity is a craft—it is how the field of techniques touches its potential. From technique to technicity we have a transduction. Technicity is a shift of level that activates a shift in process. This is how techniques evolve. Without transduction we would have only mimicry, translation. The copying of forms. Technicity in-gathers form toward its implicit potentiality and squeezes from it the drops of the excess of its actualizations. Technicity captures the affective tonality of a process, a tendency, and catapults it toward new expression.
