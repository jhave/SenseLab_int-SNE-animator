Whitehead writes: “the proposition constitutes what the feeling has felt” (1978, 186). Feeling is not a reflective act (after the fact). It is the force of the in-act experienced in the now of an event’s becoming. Say you’re experimenting with drop a curve on stage, performing Eidos: Telos (Ballet Frankfurt, 1995). Many hours of technique have preceded this event. The task is now in you: you move the movement as it comes, drawn in by choreographic principles, folding through technique.
