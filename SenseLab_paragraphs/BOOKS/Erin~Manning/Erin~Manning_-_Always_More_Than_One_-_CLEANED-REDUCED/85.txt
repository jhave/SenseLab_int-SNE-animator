Life as here defined is not limited to the organic. Life is relation. Propelled by the force of in-formation, life is the tendings and habits and attunements, the appetition, that activate the singularity of this or that unfolding process. The question is how life as a field of resonance buoyed by appetition—the enjoyment of a process, the desire for the more-than—is allied to the event in its actuality. This remains an unresolvable tension in experience. On the one hand, there is the thisness of an occasion’s resolution. This resolution (or concrescence) depends on an event singling itself out from the larger field of experience. Yet this singularity cannot tell the whole story. This is why Whitehead emphasizes that while the atomistic quality of the event must be kept in mind, we are here talking about a half second or less of experience. The how of the in-act is the more interesting and complex issue. For it is what consistently outlives the actual as defined by this or that singular expression of composition that touches on how a life courses through this life.
