Baron Cohen’s argument is that the autistic cannot bridge the worlds of the physical and the imaginary. The reason the autistic cannot do this is that they cannot put themselves in the position of another to “imagine or represent states that we or others might hold” (1995, 2). This, because the autistic does not manage to convey the complexity of his or her perception to the attending psychologist, neuroscientist, medical doctor, or academic, within a controlled environment that in many cases does not even begin to attend to his or her needs. From this comes the still far too dominant assumption that the autistic is categorically incapable of relation and empathy, the assumption that the autistic cannot experience feelings or states that concern another human. And, as we well know, without empathy you are not considered truly human.
