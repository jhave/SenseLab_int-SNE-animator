Practice and technique are key to the creation of a dance of attention. The
readiness to align of the attentive dance is what spurs the choreographic surface to come alive collectively. To cue to complex alignment in a practice of counterpoint: a body must be open to landing in more ways than one. It must attend to its tendency toward habit in order to evolve toward openness-to-invention: from technique to technicity. It must learn to respond not only to actual landings but to the virtual forces of cues that don’t land. And it must learn to move in attention with the complexity of the cue’s incipient multiplicity, landing position in the associated milieu of movement-moving where the body is always more than one.
