All movement is, to some degree, counterpoint. Movement rhythms: it connects, prolongs, undermines, subverts, dances. It never stops. Movement is always of multiple valences. There is total movement—the durational field of movement-moving that envelops all worldings—and actual movement—this or that singular occasion, this or that actual displacement. Counterpoint cuts into total movement to create an actualizable field—“an ordered interplay.” In doing so, counterpoint touches on both registers of movement, virtual and actual, tapping into the field of total movement to create an opening for this singular movement-quality in the realm of the actual. The milieu of movement now resonates with the more-than. This more-than is the counterpoint-event’s motif. This motif is a likeness. It gives the milieu a singular tonality. This tone in turn tunes the milieu to certain tendencies. A milieu with a springing motif tunes to air-likeness, for instance. Or, as in Von Uexküll’s example, fly-likeness tunes not to fly-asspecies but to a qualitative likeness of a fly-movement intensively in rhythm with the spider’s web. This likeness is first and foremost affective—it is an attunement not simply to the fly in its quantitative dimensions, or to its behaviors, but to the way the fly’s singular movement-tendencies affect the speciation spider-like. “The web—but never the fly—can be called the goal of forming the web. But the fly does indeed serve as the counterpoint . . . for the formation of the web” (Von Uexküll 2010, 193).
