“[Forsythe] spends a lot of training time teaching us about the quality of different speeds and instructing us on the change of tempo as felt in our bodies” (Haffner 2004, 139). To feel time exceeds any standard notion of timing. It is to move in the more-than of back-griddable time, to activate and exploit the transitions between micromovements in the making and movement taking form. Among the techniques for making these transitions felt is the sounding of movement: “When [Forsythe] himself dances during practice, he often translates the movement vocally into a kind of wordless singing, in order to assist us not only in visually showing the smallest change in tempo and movement dynamic through his body, but also underscoring it acoustically” (Haffner 2004, 140). Forsythe sings the rhythm of movement taking form, making experiential the folds of what cannot be perceived as such. These folds of micromovements are virtual contributions on the edge of actual movement. No actual taking form of movement could occur without the infinity of micromovements active in the displacement’s preacceleration. Micromovements are akin to the unsustainable— impossible to grasp and maintain—yet absolutely key to how movement resolves into a taking-form. When he sings movement, what Forsythe is sounding is not a body creating a particular form, but the speed of lived folding that is movement in the making.
