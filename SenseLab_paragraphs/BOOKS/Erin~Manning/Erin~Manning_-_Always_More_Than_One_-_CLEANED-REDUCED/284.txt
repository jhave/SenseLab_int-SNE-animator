The objectile is like a cue for the resolution of an experience. It is what drives the experience to its final form. For this to happen, Forsythe cannot use just any object. The object has to be immanent to the event and active in its unfolding. It has to call forth participation in a way that is at once enticing and unthreatening. It has to give the object to the experience in a way that is slightly off from what we might expect. The object cannot act in a fully predictable manner in the environment and yet has to be familiar enough to draw us in. Choreographic objects are an affordance that provoke a singular taking-form: they are the conjunctive force for the activity of relation.
