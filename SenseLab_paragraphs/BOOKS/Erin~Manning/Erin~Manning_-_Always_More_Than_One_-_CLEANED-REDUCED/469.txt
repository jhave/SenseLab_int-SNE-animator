Language is a double-edged sword.

For the modality of expression of the neurotypical tends to be language. Language is key to inclusion and, as such, to the opportunity to participate in a world that does not label you “retarded.” “Realize that I have lots on my mind and lots to say,” writes DJ Savarese (2010) in a piece called “Communicate with Me.” “What can you do to help me? The answer is communicate with me. Boldly reach out to me, and together we will goldenly share our views of the world we long to greet.”
