Memory is like having a vision in the future-past. Forsythe (2003) writes: “One of our methodologies had to do with identically remembering another person’s variation, or sprays rather [. . .] and building a kind of architecture of movement around it, but you [have] to keep seeing this other person dancing in order to perform it, so it [becomes] a way of having a vision.” Memory is visionary in the sense of foresight: a seeing-with-before in the now of movement-moving. Moving someone else’s moving while you’re watching them move is like feeling future movement. You are moving with the incipient future (the always nextness of movement) in the present passing. This is recall at work. Forsythe calls the experimentation with this recall-in-the-moving dancing with “a cloud of form” and describes it as a proprioceptive gathering of tendencies not actually reproduced but reactivated such that they can take form in relation to their already having taken place. Recall produces future memory, creating visions for movement in the making. Lived experience is the experience of fielding this visionary quality, be it in the walk or in the experimenting with new forms of movement. Becoming visionary: to experience movement’s singular capacity to generate decisive turns.
