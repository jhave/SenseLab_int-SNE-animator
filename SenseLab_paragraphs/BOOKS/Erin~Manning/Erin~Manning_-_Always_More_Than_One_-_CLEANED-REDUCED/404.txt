Tapping into a compositional matrix of relational movement depends on the capacity of a work to fold through what Simondon calls the “operative solidarity” of the elements in co-composition. A dance of attention emerges when this operative solidarity forms not a structure but a mobile architecture—a proto-architecting of movement-moving.
Movement-moving is not spurred solely by human intention. It erupts in the between of the cueing’s aligning, in the relational interval of distributed movement. As Brian Massumi (2009b) writes in relation to Simondon’s notion of individuation, “the causation is always indirect, passing through an interval of immanence: a moment of concretization whose schema is immanent to active matter.” What returns as commanding form is not the form of the event but the force of its formation. Cue to force of form.
