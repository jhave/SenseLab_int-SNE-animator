The concept of the transcendental field radically challenges standard notions of transcendence. Where transcendence relies on the alreadyexistent platform of spacetimes of experience in order to overcome them, the transcendental field is a preindividual topological surface that spurs aberrant movements out of which spacetimes are created anew, aberrant because there can never be a preimposed path for how life can and will emerge.
