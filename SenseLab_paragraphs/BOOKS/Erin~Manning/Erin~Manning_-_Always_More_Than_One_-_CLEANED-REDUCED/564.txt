The smile that needs no face is a becoming without an “I,” a life-living in the speciation. The smile that needs no face precedes being. It shapes not being-as-such but the force of a becoming that is not-yet. This force of becoming is a phasing toward a vectoring. From the amorphous shape of enthusiasm it is a tweaking toward a taking-form that en-acts. This enacting is already a hybrid, its speciation agglomerating across tendencies rather than fixed form. The smile that needs no face lulls in the betweenness of a saying, it dances in the territory of its making. The force of its more-than is always in excess of a given species.
