We enter the camp, this camp, its surfaces almost completely amber, the air like an amber gauze of sand and light, and we walk behind the women, the women weâ€™ve seen three times before in the scene of the bodies rising from the water, but this time the women are walking away from us, screaming, wailing, clutching their bodies, holding their heads (figure 8). We cannot see their faces (see figure 7).
