If we ignore the nonhuman-centered valence of Prince’s or Mukhopadhyay’s approach and persist in placing the human at the forefront as the motivating force of all events, their words will seem anthropomorphic. We will read Prince’s encounter with Kanzi simply as a human once more telling the story of an animal, in human terms; we will interpret Mukhopadhyay as giving a human face to the pen, to the tabletop, to the tree. Autistic perception warns us against this approach, however, persistently reminding us not to begin with the pre-chunked. Begin in the middle! it says. Don’t assume to know in advance how the chunking will resolve! It seems to me that we should heed these words and learn from them, with them. That we might listen more intently to how the world composes itself in a mode of perception that does not privilege the human in any of its precomposed guises or any other general categories.
