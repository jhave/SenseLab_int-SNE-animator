Thought-thinking is always in the register of feeling, and, as such, it is not yet objector human-oriented. Everything is still agitating, co-composing, across strata of expressibility. Thought in the feeling is allied to the force of the concept. Think the concept here, as do Deleuze and Guattari, not as that which gives order to thought but as that which opens thought to its outside, making available within the register of thought-thinking the force of movement. In its attunement to language it is therefore never the case that what is said is a replication of thought. The saying is a movement of thought that abstracts from the complex relation of thought-feeling. The saying is the activation of a concept itself in movement that is always more-than content. Swimming beyond the shallow end of language means composing-with language’s prearticulations, its rhythms, its silences, its jumps in register. Composing-with this beyond means making mobile the inexpressibility of the more-than in the nowness of articulation. “The closer you get to the heart of things, the more words fall apart. First they get shaky. Then they start contradicting each other or getting paradoxical. Then they just fall apart, dissolve, vanish.”29 The dissolving, vanishing, falling apart of words even as they are crafted, this is language in the making. It is what spurs us to read between the words—“But if you look between the words (not the same as between the lines), rather than at them, you can start to see things far more interesting than the words themselves.”30 Reading between the words is to attend to the interval where expressibility continues to shape expression, where the ineffable continues to caress the evolution of meaning in the fielding of the paradoxical ecologies of language and pure experience. Here, thought transduces, patterning expression in the activation of contrast, making language collective.
