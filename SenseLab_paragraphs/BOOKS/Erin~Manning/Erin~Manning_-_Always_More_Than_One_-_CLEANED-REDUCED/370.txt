I knew, of course, that this was only one proposition of what the work could do as a choreographic object. Nonetheless, spending time with DJ in the SenseLab, I realized that my research questions were still too prominent, creating too tight a constraint within what I wanted to see as an exploratory matrix. With DJ it became clear that I had to actively open up the work to its own more-than, to engage with what it could do without necessarily assuming that it was only doing its work when it was directly, locally handled.
