Yet, at first we cannot know this, and so we are almost certain the scene of the rising bodies will provide the clues to the Sabra and Shatila massacre, that the face staring into the amber-gray night of war will let us know how the repressed returns. What we find instead is that we are witnesses to what Deleuze calls “the power of the false,” that which “replaces and supersedes the form of the true, because it poses the simultaneity of incompossible presents, or the coexistence of not-necessarily true pasts” (1989, 131). The manyness of expressibility in all of its entangled unfoldings is what is at stake here. This is why, despite appearances to the contrary, it is soon revealed that this is not a film “about” the Sabra and Shatila massacre, not a film that attempts to “return” to the past to resolve the massacre’s fascistic unfolding. It is a film, rather, that surfaces the complexity of time to make felt what cannot be straightforwardly resolved, a film that asks experience in the making to encounter its own uneasiness, its own ineffability in the face of the incompossibility of truth.
Waltz with Bashir (2008) is an animated film about living memory, about life’s opening onto memory as forgetting, about the impossibility of memory’s causal narration, about the ineffability of violence’s containment within the frame. It is a drama of amber and gray-black that leaks onto all memory-surfaces, until it ends, finally, on the blues and grays of archival documentation with one startling image of orange, a dead girl’s body on the sandy road of the Sabra and Shatila refugee camp. Waltz with Bashir is a film replete with singularities that do not add up, that cross over into sheets of experience that cannot ever manage to tell the whole story, once and for all, the story of how memory and war coincide.
