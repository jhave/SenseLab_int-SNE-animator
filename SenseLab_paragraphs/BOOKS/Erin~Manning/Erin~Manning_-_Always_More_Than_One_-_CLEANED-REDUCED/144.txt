Two bodies, and finally a third, have now made their way out of the water. Bombs fall on the scene of destruction but we don’t hear them, the audioscape carried by the music that will haunt this scene, and with it, the film from beginning to end. In amber light we watch the bodies dress. The tone shifting from amber to gray, we accompany their climb into the city, where, still fastening their clothing, they weave into the streets, streets with posters of Bashir’s face, streets full of mute, anguished women, women whose voices we won’t hear until the very last scene. And then, as the camera turns, turning its back on the women, we are faced, again and once more, with the face, a full-screen close-up of the soldier’s impassive face.
