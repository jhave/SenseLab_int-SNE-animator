In equal measure, the world also tends toward the becoming-body. Bodyworlding is much more than containment, much more than envelope. It is a complex feeling-assemblage that is active between different co-constitutive milieus. It is individuation before it is self, a fielding of associated milieus that fold in, on, and through one another. For the associated milieu is never “between” constituted selves: the associated milieu is the resonant field of individuation, active always in concert with the becomings it engenders. Becoming-self is one of the ways in which this folding (body-worlding) expresses itself, but never toward a totalization of self—always toward continued individuation.11 “To think individuation it is necessary to consider being not as substance, matter or form, but as a tensile oversaturated system beyond the level of unity” (Simondon 1995, 23). Self is a modality— a singularity on the plane of individuation—always on the way toward new foldings. These foldings bring into appearance not a fully constituted human, already-contained, but co-constitutive strata of matter, content, form, substance, and expression. The self is not contained. It is a fold of immanent expressibility.
