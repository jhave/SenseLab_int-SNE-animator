Each  proposition  activates  contrast. When  Forsythe  proposes  “drop a curve,” for instance, what he means is not “reconfigure the habit” but “move through contrast.” If you tend to drop through your side, creating a curve from hip to shoulder, begin there. But go elsewhere with it—let it take you elsewhere. Feel the movement’s differential and move with its inflection in the event, letting it move the you you are becoming.
You might mistake the proposition for a simple demand. Do this! Do that! This is not the case. Whitehead emphasizes that the proposition, while it can operate linguistically, does not depend on language. “Spoken language,” Whitehead warns, “is merely a series of squeaks” (1978, 264). Language by itself means little. “The vagueness of verbal statement is such that the same form of words is taken to represent a whole set of allied propositions of various grades of abstractness” (1978, 193). When language moves us, it is because it operates in the associated milieu of relation, becoming-propositional. A proposition can unfold in language but not as an additive to an already-stable matrix of denotation. Propositions intensify, attenuate, inhibit, transmute not meaning only but the affective force of the time-slip of experience in the making.
