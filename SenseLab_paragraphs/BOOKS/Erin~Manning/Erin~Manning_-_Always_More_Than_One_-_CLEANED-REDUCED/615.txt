The complex relational field of movement-moving courses across the societies “Dawn Prince” and “Kanzi.” These societies are altered by the process, as are all of the contributory forces that have made their way into the event. These contributory forces touch on the many stories the event calls forth, each one of them now tainted by the motif, gorilla-like. Take the story of Kanzi, born October 28, 1980, a bonobo chimpanzee raised in captivity, for whom contact has been for the most part restricted to the human. Infuse this story into the event and consider how gorilla-like reframes it, foregrounding, perhaps, the fact that Kanzi’s “advanced linguistic aptitude” has made language the vehicle for communication since he was a baby. For not only does he use lexigrams but he can also understand aspects of spoken language and associate it with the lexigrams. No surprise, then, that gorilla-like emerges in the speaking as much as in the moving. Take the story of Dawn Prince, born January 31, 1964, an autistic fighting for a place in a world tuned to neurotypical modes of encounter that continuously, painfully, set her apart. Infuse this story into the event and consider how gorilla-like speaks to the force of “another regard,” something Prince has honed in her years of working with gorillas, gorillas who she feels have offered her a place in the world. These are some of the societies, in brief, that meet on that fateful afternoon to play along the fence.
