It’s not about designing the “never experienced before” but about creating an opening within the event for the outdoing of form. This involves a process of folding-through that activates a resonant fielding of different layers of dimensionalizing already in potentia. There is no reproducibility of technicity—it can never be generalized. Techniques, on the other hand, must to some degree be replicable—this very capacity for reproduction is what gives them their rigor.
