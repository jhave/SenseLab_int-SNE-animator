One thing that Manning argues is not involved from her perspective in ethical thought on the political level is the human/subjective face-to-face. She quotes Levinas’s troubled statement following the Sabra and Shatila massacre to the effect that there are some who are not eligible for the ethics of the face-to-face because they are simply “wrong.” This statement, so out of place with the tone of Levinas’s work in general, demonstrates that there is a limit to the ethics of the human face-to-face. There is a point at which it turns its back, reorienting toward a posture of moral judgment justifying exclusion. That limit is when the “other” is no longer greeted as other but looms as inhuman. Manning’s reformulation of the political question is designed to disable this limit in order to preserve a political ethics of engagement. Her process philosophy in fact recognizes no such limit, for the simple reason that the betweenness of human being as it conceives it is not itself human. It is more than human: human plus many-one singular-generic spacetimes of experience; human plus the eventful improvisation of new and emergent vitality affects; human plus contingencies belonging to any number of categories; human plus more than currently human potential, collectively individuating. The more than human of the political and the ethical is a constant concern throughout Always More Than One. It is here that Manning’s thought reaches its most far-reaching, original, and potentially controversial extension.
