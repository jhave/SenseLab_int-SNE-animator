“Coming back” is about locating the child in a universe compatible with a much more limited notion of experience and communication. It is therefore far from the “awakening” experienced by Sue Rubin through language. For it lacks sensitivity to neurodiversity and the richness of radical difference, and of course backgrounds a long history of what makes language rich within the realm of the literary and the poetic.
