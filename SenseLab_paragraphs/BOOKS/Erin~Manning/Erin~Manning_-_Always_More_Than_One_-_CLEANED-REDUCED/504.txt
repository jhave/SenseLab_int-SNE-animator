Autistwork n2 is cut through more than it is traced over by a purpling: purple traces, color-lines cut across the tremulous center, vibrate in a quiver of surfacing that creates an incessant foregrounding-backgrounding. Feel the vortex and you cannot but see the purple texturing, the purple pushing through a background of open quasi-colorlessness into a tremulous foregrounding not of purple per se but of an intensively affective purpling, a force of light shimmering. This purpling is an activity more than it is a color, a trace, or a line. It agitates the fold. It surfaces it, layering it with potential shapings, affects on the verge. Barely felt, in the seeing.
