Overarticulation, as the vibratory resonance of movement’s excess—the felt surplus of its actualization—creates a field for durational movement that coexists with the timed event of movement-moving. The more precise the technicity, the more complex the field movement leaves behind and casts forth. Technicity embeds margins of indetermination across systems of technique, activating the associated milieu of emergence itself. It is the practice that invents at the very edges of composition where the composition seems to have already come to its limit. To dance the virtual is to have been overarticulated as a mutating ecology that continuously moves beyond position. To dance the virtual is to have straddled the interval between technique and technicity, to have danced the immanent futurity of movement in the making.
