“Choreography starts from any point,” writes William Forsythe (qtd. in Caspersen 2000, 33). Choreography cleaves an occasion, activating its relational potential. It makes time, beginning its process anew always from the middle of the event. Choreography is thus a proposition to the event. It asks the event how its ecology might best generate and organize the force of movement-moving. It does so not by abstracting itself from the event but always as part of the event—choreography can never be separated out from its coming into itself as event.
