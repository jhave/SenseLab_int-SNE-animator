To appreciate the intensive passage from choreographed stage-space to mobile architecture in One Flat Thing, reproduced, you have to think the choreography as the setting into place of future iterations of complex movement propositions active in a collective individuation of spacetimes of experience. Look at the tables moving to the front of the cavernous space and see them as their own incipient movement configurations. See the tables pushing the dancers as much as the dancers pushing them. Note that the choreography is already distributed, intensively fielding body-object recompositions. See the topological choreographic surface of the dance as co-constitutive of past-future movement events cueing to create a collective individuation for the deformation of the same yet divergent multidimensional supple surface. See One Flat Thing, reproduced less as a stable tableconfiguration with mobile dancers than as a field-surface of mobility, replete with different velocities, including those of the objects. Note that the objects are always already morphing into propositions for movement experimentation. Note that the tables are dancing, reconfiguring, moving movement as it “persons.” See the choreographic environment or stagespace not as a floor holding objects in place but as a dimensionalizing mobile surface moving tabled bodies, a folding event-space calling forth series of dephasings inflecting space, extracting figures, for the event of architecting mobility.
