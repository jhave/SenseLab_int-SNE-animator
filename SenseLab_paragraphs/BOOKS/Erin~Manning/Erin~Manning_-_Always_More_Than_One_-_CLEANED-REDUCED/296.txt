Forsythe is more interested in the folding of space than the form-taking of bodies (Forsythe qtd. in Forsythe and Sigmund 2000). His choreographic propositions begin with this folding, activating a creative tension between the virtual extensity of a durational rhythm and the actual intensity of a moving in-time. From creating environmental conditions for performance to creating propositions for relational movement, Forsythe’s work remains an activity that folds forward into a complex ecological nexus. As a choreographer of missiles of movement, Forsythe’s work thus makes felt the “what else” of choreography—its capacity to craft an associated milieu of relation that extends far beyond the stage. What else is an associated milieu but a force-field for the crafting of the as yet unthought where the microperceptual and the micropolitical meet to create new movements in the making? “You don’t need a choreographer to dance” (Forsythe qtd. in Forsythe and Sigmund 2001). What you need is a choreographic proposition. Propositions are ontogenetic: they emerge as the germ of the occasion and persist on the nexus of experience to take hold once more through new occasions of experience. Forsythe’s choreographic objects are propositions in just this
sense.
