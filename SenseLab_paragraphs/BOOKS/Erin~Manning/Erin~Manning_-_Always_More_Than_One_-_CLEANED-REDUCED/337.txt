Key is to maintain the balance between the active constraints built into the singular event proposition and the open system of its deployment. Mobile architectures never result from a posture of “anything goes,” but nor do they emerge from strict replayings of individual or object-oriented scenarios dedicated to predictable outcomes.
To turn the object into a choreographic proposition, the object must become diagrammatic. This means that the object has to form a series with the distributed relational movement of the event, opening itself to the event’s vacuoles of potential.
Take two different Slow Clothes events. The first (shown in figure 17) took place in March 2008 at the Society for Art and Technology (sat) in Montreal. The setup was complex: a magnetic assemblage of plastic tubes and fabric constellations covering approximately nine hundred square feet. The environment was set up through groupings of tonalities of color to create a forestlike setting of fabric composition. In addition to choreographing the actual compositions such that the fabric could easily be touched and moved, much thought was given to the way participants would enter and move through the wider event-space of the gallery. The wager was that how people entered would affect how they would continue to move through the installation and create with it.
