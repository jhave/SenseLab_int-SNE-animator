possibility of reaching out: I touch you to touch you again. To touch is not to know.
What I do have when I reach out to touch you is an idea. In his writing on democracy-to-come, Derrida foregrounds the notion of the idea:
We already have some “idea” of what “democracy” should mean, and what it will have already meant —and the idea, the ideal, the Greek eidos or the idea also designates the turn of a contour, the limit surrounding a visible form.
Did we not have some idea of democracy, we would never worry about its indetermination. We would never seek to elucidate its meaning or, indeed, call for its advent. (2005, 18)
As an idea, democracy can not be conceived as anything but that toward which I reach, unknowing. Within the idea is the notion of liberty: to be free is to have an idea. Derrida writes:
First it should be noted that if this freedom ... seems to characterize social and political behaviours, the right and power of each to do what he or she pleases, the faculty of decision and self-determination, as well as the license to play with various possibilities, it presupposes, more radically
still, more originally, a freedom of play, an opening of indetermination and indecidability in the very concept of democracy, in the interpretation of the democratic. (2005, 25)
