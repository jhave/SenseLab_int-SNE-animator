Thick to Think
To be a body is to be thick with thought. To think is to open the way to- ward the political as that which must continually be rethought. It is impor- tant to register the political voice in this narrative I am weaving in order to assess the vitality of the kind of expression made possible through sensing. A politics that senses rather than investing all of its energy in the practice of signiﬁcation is not a politics without rigor. Indeed, there may be nothing less rigorous or more apolitical than the acceptance of signiﬁcation as the basis for experience. This only reinstates the dichotomy between reason and sensing.
Politics has been invested in the narrative of signiﬁcation since its meta- physical beginnings. By metaphysical, I am referring to a privileging of a certain organization of time that casts an opposition between the temporal and the atemporal, the eternal and the transitory, the ﬁnite and the inﬁnite, the transcendental and the empirical. This kind of political time (what Michael Shapiro calls national time4) refutes the potential of time to express, to reach toward, to pace space. If we relinquish this imaginary of time, what remains is a kind of radical ﬁnitude, a living-toward-death, a movement of thought, a skinscape, a politics of touch, a certain virtual becoming that opens the way for a thinking of a democracy-to-come.
Pace becomes political when we begin to think time as a movement not in one direction but as a reaching toward that is rhizomatic. In Derrida’s terms, we would then be thinking time as aporia.5 The aporia refers here to the “‘impossible’ relation between the passage of time and political organi- zation” (Beardsworth 1996, xiii). Derrida suggests that philosophy’s tradi- tional disavowal of time is already political and therefore carries political consequences. Metaphysical logic translates time into presence rather than
