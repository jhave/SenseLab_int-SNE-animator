tem of law and order is predicated and maintained by a violence that could dissolve it. The state asserts that to be safe (free of violence), we must con- sent to state governmental practices. “Violence exists at the core of Consti- tutional power to the State (in the name of the People) to practice violence over the people, while the ofﬁce of the judge includes a fully sanctioned and absolved ‘homicidal quality’” (Gourgouris 1996, 132). As Robert Cover suggests, state violence is not explicitly stated in these cases because violence is written into the very idea of government (in Gourgouris 1996, 132).
Yet, in many ways, the sensing body is anathema to the national body- politic, to its politics of consensus, to its violent politics of exclusion. “I am   the continuous, necessary overcoming of myself,” writes Nietzsche, “. . . noth- ing but struggle and becoming and purpose and contradiction of purposes” (1969, 3:271). We are our body, and we are the spaces we create and em- body as we reach-toward. We are the embodiment of homesickness that at- tests to the fact that ultimate stability (consensus) is impossible. To live, we touch, or conversely, to stop touching is to die, to deprive ourselves of a body. Tactility is fraught with an ambiguity we cannot resolve. This ambi- guity, this complex worlding, is perhaps the most difﬁcult thing to sustain over time. This is the founding paradox of the national body-politic.
