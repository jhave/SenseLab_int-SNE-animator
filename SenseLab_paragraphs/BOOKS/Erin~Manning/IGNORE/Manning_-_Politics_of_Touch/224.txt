Thinking the body connectively creates a path for exploring the relation between bodies and politics as a rhythmic capacity for différance whereby bodies enter into relation with surfaces and “holes sprout in what had been experienced as wholes” (Doyle 2003, 12). There is nothing passive in this relation: bodies become surprising expressions of the event, expressions alive with asigniﬁcation and sensuality that tear conﬁgurations of meaning and foster the emergence of new forms of metamorphosis.
Politics of touch are postvital politics in the sense that they reframe what we understand “life” to be. In our philosophical and political blind- ness as regards the prosthetic nature of the body, we have consistently over- looked the manner in which politics has written life as a scientiﬁc object, rendering it indiscernible from installed systems of representation. If we consider postvital politics as an opportunity to foreground the relationality that is at the heart of a politics of touch, we realize that the boundaries between science and representation are soluble. This is not new to science.
Doyle writes:
The very success of the informatic paradigm, in ﬁelds as diverse as molecular biology and ecology, has paradoxically dislocated the very object of biologi- cal research.... This “postvital” biology is, by and large, interested less in  the characteristics and functions of living organisms than in sequences of molecules and their effects. These sequences are themselves articulable through databases and networks; they therefore garner their effects through relentless repetitions and refrains, connections and blockages rather than through the autonomous interiority of an organism.
