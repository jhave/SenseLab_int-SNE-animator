controlled by one body and given to another or withheld. This attitude posits as its point of departure a stable body that exists in a pre-given space-time which contains an active giver and a passive receptor. Politics of Touch chal- lenges this assumption, positioning the senses relationally as expressions of moving bodies. This presupposes a vastly altered concept of time and space. Whereas in the active-passive commonsense model, time and space are located as stable signiÔ¨Åers into which the body enters, within a relational model, space and time are qualitatively transformed by the movements of the body. The body does not move into space and time, it creates space and time: there is no space and time before movement.
