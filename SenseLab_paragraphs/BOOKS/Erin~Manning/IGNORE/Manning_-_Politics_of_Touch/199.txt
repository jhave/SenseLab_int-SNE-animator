vocabulary of the future anterior is a vocabulary that calls forth an articula- tion of the political that departs from the stabilizing narratives of the nation- state, in which space and time remain overdetermined by the categories of geography and history subsumed to territory and identity. To conceptualize gender as operative within a vocabulary of the not-yet (or not quite yet) is to begin to think gender as engendering and bodies as mechanisms for the rethinking of time and space.
A politics of touch engages a milieu that is continually under construc- tion. This milieu is incorporeal in the sense that it does not exist except in the relation that will emerge through individuations that have not yet ma-  terialized. This milieu is as much a transitory location as a spring board for individuations to occur not at the level of the individual body, but in rela- tion. This milieu is an energetic force ﬁeld that constitutes form and matter beyond notions of internal and external pre-conﬁgurations. Symbiosis of matter and form emerge relationally. This calls forth engenderings. The en- gendering body is a body not only in relation but of relation. Relation is ac- tivity, intensity, movement toward. Engendering is an event through which emergent bodies take form.
