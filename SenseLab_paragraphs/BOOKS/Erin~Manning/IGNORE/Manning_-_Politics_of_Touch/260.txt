These are words through  which the body-politic of  the nation-state tends to operate. These are words that underpin the discourse of the secure body. “If you do not relinquish your BwO and assume a stable form, we can- not protect you.” Some bodies are easier to secure than others. My lesbian body, my gay body, my diseased body, my female body, my aged body: these bodies are more costly. But even these bodies are useful to the state: they make possible the insecurity on which the need for security is predicated. Be secure! Conform! Even your distorted body can be taken into the fold! Conﬁrm your conformation by organizing your excess: we may be able to protect you! But hide your difference at all costs!
The terrible revelation is that bodies can never truly conform. Organisms do restratify, but don’t forget: these restratiﬁcations are part of the strata. The organism and the BwO coexist. They make and remodel one-another. There is no pure body that can be protected. Imagine the security risk: we must not only protect “the body” but also the intensities that are dissemi- nated in the process of reaching out!
Bodies without Organs disarticulate. One of the symptoms of this dis- articulation is touch. Disarticulation is not the opposite of articulation: it is its supplement. Touch provokes disarticulation by marking the impossibility of a ﬁnal reaching toward. Touch makes possible the image of a body falling apart, leaving parts of itself behind, incorporeally becoming. Touch reminds us of the ghost we see when a camera catches our movements multiplied. Touch evokes a spectral politics, a politics of capture that never quite reaches its goal. Touch is an adventurous sensation.
Don’t misunderstand: touch does not simply destratify.
