Becoming unlimited comes to be the ideational and incorporeal event, with all of its characteristic reversals between future and past, active and passive, cause and effect, more and less, too much and not enough, already and not yet. It is eternally that which has just happened and that which is about to happen, but never that which is happening . . .” (Deleuze 1990b, 8)
