The state continues to be relevant, even in a discourse of a politics of touch, as Nietzsche observes:
Coldly it tells lies too, and this lie crawls out of its mouth: “I the state, am the people”... it is annihilators who set traps for the many and call them State; they hang a sword and a hundred appetites over them.... State I call where all drink is poison, the good and the wicked; State, where all lose themselves, the good and the wicked; State, where the slow suicide of all is called “life.” (1969, 49–50)
