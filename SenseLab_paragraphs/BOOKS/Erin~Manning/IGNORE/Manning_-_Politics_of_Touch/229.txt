The political force of prescriptive and essentializing discourses is not con- ﬁned to the validity of their truth claims. The matter of essentialism exceeds the politics of correction because the body as the scene of writing is an inscripting of all essentialisms, even of the politically offensive. With/in the complexity of the resulting weave, the stuff of essence is rearticulated: it is  no longer a simple unity whose efﬁcacy is directly legible. (1997, 160)
