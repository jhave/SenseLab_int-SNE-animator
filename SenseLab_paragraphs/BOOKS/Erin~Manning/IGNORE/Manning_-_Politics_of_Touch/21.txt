This suggests that healthy children are directly proportional to touching mothers. Blood relations are not key: adoptive mothers can perform the same tasks with similar effects.
This article came to my attention late in the process of writing Politics of Touch. I foreground it now because it suggests that interesting new research on the senses is under way, and it allows me to make explicit the tools re- quired to rearticulate the relation between bodies and senses. It also empha- sizes my own progression as regards the project of Politics of Touch. When I began writing this book, ﬁnding work on the senses was such a challenge that I welcomed anything I could lay my hands on. Had I encountered the article three years previous, I would have been especially encouraged because the research demonstrates a qualitative change in bodies as a result of touch. At the time—in what I considered to be a disembodied political climate where political philosophy was completely disinterested in the senses—any research on the senses was welcome. Today —having located the senses in all kinds
