expresses in such a way as to always intervene in the imaginary process of Aufhebung. There is no synthesis: “what is expressed is discovered as a third term that makes distinctions inﬁnitely more real and identity inﬁnitely bet- ter thought. What is expressed is sense: deeper than the relation of causal- ity, deeper than the relation of representation” (Deleuze 1990a, 335).
What is expressed through a politics of touch is the incommensurability of sense. This is politics at its best. A politics not of consensus or causality, but a sensing politics of bodies-in-movement: a politics of touch. Sense, not sens. Direction but not goal-directed. An afﬁrmation of a movement toward. This is what it is to sense(s). Sense is multiple: to sense is to multi-  ply bodies, to exceed and extend the ﬂesh through various instantiations of Bodies without Organs. To sense is to deviate from the organic capacities of the body, to challenge the interstices between insides and outsides, spaces and times. To sense is to world in all directions at once. Through the senses, bodies become alchemical mixtures, incorporeal concoctions of visions and touches, smells and sights, tastes and sounds. Senses lead us without taking us by the hand. Senses draw us toward an object as they modulate our own responses, relaying insides and outsides into a conglomerate that deviates, always, from the implied borders of our skins. There are no sense-borders: sense is not a limit-concept. To sense is to world unlimitedly.
