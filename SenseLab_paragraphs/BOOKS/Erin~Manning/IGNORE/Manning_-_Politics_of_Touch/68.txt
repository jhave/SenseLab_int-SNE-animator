It is, as Rancière notes, “simply the return of the ‘nor- mal’ state of things which is that of politics’ non-existence” (2001, 14).
A politics of touch implies a spiraling politics in-creation, an eternal return of the unknowable.

Politics of touch are tactical discursive tactics of the unknowable.
