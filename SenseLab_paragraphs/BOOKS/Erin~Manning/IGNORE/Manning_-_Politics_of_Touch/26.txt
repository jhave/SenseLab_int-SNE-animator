Politics is deﬁned in the ﬁrst chapter as a composition foregrounding a dynamic sensing body in movement. This body in movement is an impro- vised body—both at the level of its movements and its signiﬁcations.
Argentine tango functions throughout Politics of Touch as a refrain (in the Deleuzo-Guattarian sense).1 Through the tango, I have attempted to make the point that touch is not simply the laying of hands. Touch is the act of reaching toward, of creating space-time through the worlding that occurs when bodies move. Touch, seen this way, is not simply an addendum to an already-stable body. Touch is that which forces us to think bodies alongside notions such as repetition, prosthesis, extension. This is why Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of the Body without Organs (a concept that forces us to rethink the boundaries of the body) takes central stage toward the end of Politics of Touch.
In Politics of Touch, I attempt to engage the reader to stray from a com- monsense reading of the senses. This, I hope, will allow the reader to imag- ine and express a politics that challenges the notion that the (political) body is a stable locus of enunciation.
