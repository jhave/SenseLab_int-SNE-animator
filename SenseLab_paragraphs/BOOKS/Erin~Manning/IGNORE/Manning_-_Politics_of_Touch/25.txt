Bodies on the Move
Politics of Touch seeks to do at least two things: (1) to expose the ways in which the senses—touch in particular, but always in implicit interaction with other senses—foreground a processual body; (2) to explore how think- ing the processual body potentially inﬂuences the ways in which we articu- late and live the political. The object of inquiry is therefore the body.
To speak about bodies is ﬁrst and foremost to explore the ways in which bodies move. I locate touch as one way of thinking this body-in-movement. This is not to give touch preferential treatment: throughout, touch is to be understood synesthetically, operating along relational vectors always in dia- logue with other senses (of which there are likely many more than ﬁve). To think touch synesthetically is to appreciate all of the ways in which move- ment qualitatively alters the body. As becomes apparent by the end of Poli- tics of Touch, the senses prosthetically alter the dimensions of the body, in- citing the body to move in excess of its-self toward the world. Sensing toward the world implicates the body in a worlding that re-organizes con- ceptions of space and time.
The body at work in Politics of Touch is a sensing body in movement. This is not a “new” body (though it always networks in new and diverging ways). It is a body that has always emerged through and alongside other bodies, be they political bodies, gendered bodies, raced bodies. What is “new” about the body foregrounded in Politics of Touch is not its shape or form but the rela- tional matrices it makes possible.
In Politics of Touch, the exploration of touch is an interdisciplinary endeavor that depends on striking new relations between terms, subjects, and ideas. Politics of Touch begins with an exploration of how touch works.
