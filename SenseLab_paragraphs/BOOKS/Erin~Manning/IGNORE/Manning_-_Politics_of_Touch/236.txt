Asymmetrical zones of speed characterize a thinking about time that chal- lenges the teleology of the nation-state, in which time is conceived ﬁrst as a stable historicity that supports the sublimation of geography into history. National time provides few openings within its streamlined narratives for processual concepts such as individuation, opting instead for the close enu- meration of the citizens within the imposed structure of the state apparatus. Democratic time, on the other hand, functions in the mode of the not-yet, which is characteristic of the future anterior. The not-yet in-forms the present while incorporating within it past and future. Time that is no longer con- ceived as linear is a time that carries within experience sheets of the past and future, virtually present. Radically different from national time, which emphasizes a historicity that depends on continuity (even if it must continu- ally be reinvented as such), democratic time documents what is yet-to-come in the form of possible worlds.12 Such a politics of potential provokes ﬁssures in homogeneous organizations of time-space. Diverging from the homoge- nization of time that drives the nationalist rhetoric that propels the state apparatus, democratic time cannot be about an enforcing of identity within a ﬁxed territory (a coagulation of space). It must instead rethink how space meets time in and through the body, thus creating spaced-times and timed- spaces that are not territories in the usual sense but rifts or forks, as Con- nolly envisages them:
A rift is constitutive of time itself, in which time ﬂows into a future neither fully determined by a discernible past nor ﬁxed by its place in a cycle of eter- nal return, nor directed by an intrinsic purpose pulling it along. Free time. Or, better, time as belonging, replete with the dangers and possibilities attached to such a world. (Connolly 2002a, 144)
