Do Not Touch
A politics of touch is a politics not of the particularity of touch as touch, but of touch as the incorporeal experience of contact. How tact-ful is this pol- itics? How is tact secured, politically, within movement that reaches toward? What happens to a politics of touch when we associate touch with tact?
Whereas so far a politics of touch has been conceived as a movement that expands the virtual toward potential, it would seem—if we associate touch with con-tact—that touch is also implicated in a movement that is based on an interdiction not to touch. Tact embodies this injunction that challenges me in advance to have known how and when I should or should not touch.
Tact, like touch, etymologically emerges from the stem tangere, to touch. In its ﬁrst deﬁnition tact is touch. Yet, something has occurred, in time, that has created an uncanny rift between tact and touch: tact is interpreted as a certain prescience that keeps me from touching, from moving toward. As deﬁned in the Oxford English Dictionary, tact is the “ready and delicate sense of what is ﬁtting and proper in dealing with others, so as to avoid giv- ing offence, or win good will; a skill or judgement in dealing with [people] or negotiating difﬁcult or delicate situations; the faculty of saying or doing the right thing at the right time.” Tact is knowing when not to touch.
