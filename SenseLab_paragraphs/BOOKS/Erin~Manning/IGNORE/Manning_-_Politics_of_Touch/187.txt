We are tempted to believe in a standard, “normal” two-gender sexuality, but over the long haul, genders change. Imperfections, developmental abnor- malities, kinks, sports, “monstrous” new forms of behaviour, including repro- ductive behaviour, arise and persist as sexual organisms undergo social trans- formation.
