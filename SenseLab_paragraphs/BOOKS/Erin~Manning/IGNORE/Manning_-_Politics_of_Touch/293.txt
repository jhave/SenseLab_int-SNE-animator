touch skin. But the untouchability inspired by my desire to touch is based on the fact that you are reaching from my body as much as I am reaching from yours. Together we become prosthetically entwined. We touch an incor- poreal body that is created through our reaching-toward. This body does not pre-exist the relation. Touch is a prosthesis through which our bodies make contact. Touch is the manner in which I navigate from a subject posi- tion (an imagined stability) to an in-betweenness where the line between you and me becomes blurred. To touch is to become posthuman.

We need ﬁrst to understand that the human form—including human desire and all its external representations—may be changing radically, and thus must be re-visioned. We need to understand that ﬁve hundred years of humanism may be coming to an end as humanism transforms itself into something that we must helplessly call post-humanism. (in Hayles 1999, 1)
