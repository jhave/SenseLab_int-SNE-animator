always virtual, it is a touching that has not yet touched, that has not yet been touched, that is continually in the process of initiating a movement toward a touch that may or may not lead to a spacing through which I will con- tinue my process of individuation.
Derrida writes: “Of democracy there could only be but a trace” (2005, 39). The liberty at the heart of democracy is a liberty that invites me to move alongside the trace that democracy embodies. There is no predetermination here. The trace emerges, it propulses, it creates, but it does not deﬁne or substantiate. Democracy is the liberty to appreciate the trace. Derrida writes:
In political philosophy, the dominant discourse about democracy presupposes this freedom as power, faculty, or the ability to act, the force or strength, in short, to do as one pleases, the energy of an intentional and deciding will. It is thus difﬁcult to see, and this is what remains to be thought, how another experience of freedom might found in an immediate, continuous, and effec- tive way what would still be called a democratic politics or a democratic political philosophy.
