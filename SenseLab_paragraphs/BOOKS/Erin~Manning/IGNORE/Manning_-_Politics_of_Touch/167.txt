Touch
Our skin is the most sensitive and oldest of our organs. It is our most efﬁcient of protectors. The skin arises from the outermost of three embryonic cell layers, the ectoderm, which gives rise to the hair, teeth, and the sense or- gans of smell, taste, hearing, vision, and touch. Touch is the earliest sense to develop in the human embryo. It gives us our experience of depth and thickness and shape. Skin develops sensitivities that depend largely on the kind of environmental stimulation it receives. The skin is a central organ system of the body. Without the functions performed by the skin, we can- not survive.
Sensory and motor tonus of the skin are uninterruptedly stimulated by the environment: nerve ﬁbers conducting tactile impulses are generally of larger size than those associated with other organs. Coetaneous stimulation is essential for the adequate organic and behavioral development of the organism. Newborn animals must be licked if they are to survive (otherwise they are at risk of dying of a functional failure of the genitourinary system and/or the gastrointestinal system). In humans, this licking is replaced by a long period of labor, during which the contractions of the uterus stimulate the fetal skin. Infants who are not adequately touched after birth often suffer tremendously, sometimes even dying as a result (Montagu 1971, 82). Skin
