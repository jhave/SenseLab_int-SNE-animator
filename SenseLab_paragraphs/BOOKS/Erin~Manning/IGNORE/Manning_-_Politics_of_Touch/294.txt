The BwO is posthuman to the extent that in its deterritorializations it per- sistently rebels against the humanism that holds bodies to their organisms. Posthumanity gives us a vocabulary to think through prosthetics in relation to the senses. In a humanist vocabulary of the organism, to conceive of the senses as prosthetic is an unseemly endeavor. Bodies are more likely to be thought of as uniﬁed and unique. The posthuman, on the other hand, takes the prosthesis as a condition of the organism, as its supplement. The human does not become prosthetic. Hayles writes:
[T]he posthuman view thinks of the body as the original prosthesis we all learn to manipulate, so that extending or replacing the body with other prostheses becomes a continuation of a process that began before we were born.... [T]he posthuman view conﬁgures human being so that it can be seamlessly articulated with intelligent machines. In the posthuman, there are no essential differences or absolute demarcations between bodily existence and computer simulation, cybernetic mechanism and biological organism, robot teleology and human goals.... [T]he posthuman subject  is an amalgam, a collection of heterogeneous components, a material- informational entity whose boundaries undergo continuous construction and reconstruction. (1999, 3)
