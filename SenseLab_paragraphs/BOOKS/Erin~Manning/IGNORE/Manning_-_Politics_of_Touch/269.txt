Politics is both of and beyond the structure. Disciplinary politics demands the apparent coherence of the structure. Control societies resist the struc- ture. This is not a dichotomy. All politics is always a passage, even a seden- tary politics. A politics of touch is not a new politics but a rearticulation of a movement between, a recomposition of a transrelational acceleration that witnesses certain shifts from a politics of the body to a politics of the BwO. Don’t forget: bodies are also stratiﬁed on the BwO. There is no body that can completely resist the structure.
I project my body. My projected body is a BwO that envelops a relation of movement and rest. My body is the relation of the relation. Sensing, I embody that engendering relation, I charge that relation with an embodied- event. Touch is eventful. Now to ratify: touch is not knowledge. Touch is expression. A politics of touch is not about knowledge but about the pro- jection of experience that results in expression. It doesn’t end there. Expres- sion is not a result. Expression engenders the desire to reach again. Expression calls forth the concept. The concept calls for a redeﬁnition: politics of touch will never be One.
