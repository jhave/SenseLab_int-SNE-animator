in the process of metamorphosis), the network of forces that sustain the image of the state immediately languishes. It becomes apparent that the body never belonged to the state: the body always exceeded its containers. This does not mean that there is not a representation of the body active within nation-state politics today. For the concept of the nation to be opera- tive, bodies are essential.
Conceivably, the nation-state could be called the body-state. This is why the state’s body-politic is so focused on drawing an image of the body that must remain dependent on the imaginary of the nation-state. If we remove the body from the state, the conﬂation of identity and territory cannot be  sustained. If we imagine the body not as a container that returns to the state for sustenance, but that challenges the state’s pre-determined enclo- sures of belonging and insecurity through its unpredictable states of meta- morphosis, we are left with a state-less body and a body-less state. This state-less body touches across space and time, not reaching toward striated grids of intelligibility but toward new networks of power/knowledge. This body is alive in its infralanguage, not in its silent recitations of the state’s incantations of sovereignty.
