the quality of matter is already a source of form. What we consider a unique form (my body as woman, for example) is but the latest episode in a series of trans-formations. Matter is material because it can be modeled in ways that stabilize its de-formation. Pure form already contains gestures11 through which matter can mutate. This suggests that no body is pre-formed with con- crete matter. Engendering precedes gender.
If we take into consideration the micropractices of engendering, we can imagine life as an emergent property of complex autopoetic12 systems involv- ing nonlinear feedback and combinatory processes. Engendering—as sym- biotic becoming—plays a role in the discourse of reproduction from the  autocatalytic association of cells to the association of multicellular bodies, from societies of bacteria to social domains of disciplinary sex, from digital cultures of cloning images to bio-technological proliferations of cellular engineering.
It is not a matter of socio-cultural imitations of the natural or biological imi- tations of society. What comes ﬁrst is neither a given essence nor the signiﬁ- cation of essence. Rather, the abstract concatenation of bodies-sexes de- lineates the primacy of heterogeneous mixtures or symbiosis—biophysical elements, socio-cultural energies, economic trades, technical inventions, political forces and particles of desire—unfolding the potential of a body
to become. (Parisi 2004, 16)
