between us. This is politics: the moment when I re-cognize that to touch an other is to touch the impenetrable.
A gesture toward an other—a politics of touch—is never static. Like touch, politics is that which orients me toward an other in a movement, in a directionality. A politics that is a politics of touch evokes a displace- ment—where, often, the terrain from which I diverge seems much more familiar, more comprehensible, more certain —a displacement that produces afﬁnities, attractions, mirages, magnetisms and divergences, ruptures, ﬁssures, and dissociations. Rancière suggests that politics is a term synonymous with democracy when politics refers to an “evanescent moment when tensions arising from a human being-in-common produces instances of disruption, generating sources of political action” (Panagia 2001, 1). Politics of touch is the practice of asserting a position which disrupts the logic of arche. Speech that is political must involve an argument that is neither pre-established nor regurgitated. A politics of touch must not be conceived as a politics of community: with touch the center cannot be formulated, let alone reached. A politics of touch is based on the logic of disagreement, of misunder- standing (mésentente). Language in circulation, gestures in movement: this is a politics of touch. Politics of touch are not the exercise of hierarchical power, but an opening toward a production of power that incites us to act. Too often we conﬂate politics and a repressive understanding of power, as a result of which we have a tendency to assume power as an heir to the sov- ereign, thereby conﬁning politics to the state. Politics should not be deﬁned on the basis of a pre-existing subject. Politics must always be thought in
relation.
