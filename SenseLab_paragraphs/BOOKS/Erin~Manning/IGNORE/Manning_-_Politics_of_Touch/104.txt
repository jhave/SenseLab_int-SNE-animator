Chang and Lei-Yu Fai’s friendship is unheimlich (strange, uncanny, home- less) in a way Fai and Po-Wing’s never was. Chang and Fai do not speak of “home.” Instead they allow their friendship to lead them to “the end of the world.” Within this unheimlich quality of unknowability, we sense a politics of touch not unlike the tango we experience, in the last scene of the ﬁlm, danced by Po-Wing and another man in El Sur, a tango during which it is no longer visible who is leading and who is following. “The body of the friend,” writes Derrida, “his body proper, could always become the body of an other.... outside all place or placeless, without family or familiarity, out- side of self... strange, but also ‘a stranger to’” (1997, 177–78). The friend- ship emerging between Chang and Fai, an unheimlich friendship experi- enced only in the last moments of their “togetherness,” is like the last tango danced in Happy Together. It is a friendship-to-come, an uncanny and strange friendship that does not bind them as individuals but instead allows them to sense one another, to listen, to hear, to touch, to make con-tact.
Theirs is a friendship of potential. It is a modiﬁcation of space-time, a shifting between and through two bodies, a movement that evokes the in-betweenness that are bodies-in-motion. This latent friendship echoes later in the ﬁlm when Lai-Yu Fai returns to Hong Kong via Taipei. Despite his separation from Chang, it feels as though their friendship has ﬂourished.
