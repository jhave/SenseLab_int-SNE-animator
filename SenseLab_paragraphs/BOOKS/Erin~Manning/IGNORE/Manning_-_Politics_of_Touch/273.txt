In Spinoza the thesis according to which the civil state does not abolish the state of nature has as its correlate—despite the fears that can be inspired in it by the revolutions and seditions that try to change the form of government—the afﬁrmation that the civil state can never be entirely dissolved. It is not by an external “nature” but by its very social form that every state is permanently threatened from inside. (Balibar in Montag and Stolze 1997, 177)
