place, dancing instead at the borders of existence in the interloping worlds between here and there. It is not the dance of cities or countries, but the dance of the ghetto, of the space that cannot be accurately named or deﬁned. Tango’s uncanniness resides in the velocity of the movements that traverse its experience of listening to an other, an other who enters and remains in-between, an other I touch, who touches me.
