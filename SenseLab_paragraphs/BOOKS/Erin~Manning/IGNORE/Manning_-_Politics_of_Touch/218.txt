Shifting Skinscapes
Our skins are being designed even as we speak. Bodies, skins, politics, democ- racy are always already technological. To think of the relation between skins, bodies, and senses, we must become comfortable with the logic of the prosthesis. Touch, I would like to suggest, is a certain prosthesis not only of politics, but of the body itself. While the prosthetic7 emerges as a current concept in new technologies and will be discussed as such here, it is impor- tant to underline the fact that I refer to prosthesis not as a way of situating a post-technological body but in an effort to locate the body as always-already technological.

The rise of digital media over the past decade has changed the practice of design..., the primacy of the skeleton has given way to the primacy of the skin.... New materials react to light, heat, touch and mechanical stress. Translucency and mutability have replaced transparency and permanence. The outer envelope has detached from the interior volume. Flexible mem- branes are embedded with digital and mechanical networks.... Industrial skins have assumed a life of their own. (2002, 31)
The corporeal is showing new kinds of evidence. Increasingly, human tissue is becoming an incorporation of complex weaves of dacron, silicon, and metal. Biology is in dialogue with edible chemistries of hybrid derivation, as electronic circuitries measure the pulse and possibility of life.8 This era of the always already technologized body is not an era devoid of touch. In fact, touch as a prosthetic device is being multiplied at the rate at which skins
