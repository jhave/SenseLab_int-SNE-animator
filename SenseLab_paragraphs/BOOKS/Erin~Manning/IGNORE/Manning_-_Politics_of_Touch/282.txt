to say, the nature or essence of the external body: rather does it indelicate the present constitution of our own body, and so the way in which our capacity to be affected is being at that moment exercised. An affection of  our body is only a corporeal image, and the idea of the affection as it is in our mind is an inadequate idea, an imagining. And we have yet another sort of affection. From a given idea of an affection there necessarily ï¬‚ow affects  of feelings (affectus). Such feelings are themselves affections, or rather a new kind of idea of an affection.... (Deleuze 1990a, 220)
