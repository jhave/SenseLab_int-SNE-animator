Gil suggests that of all languages, it is only articulated language that fully realizes the code of translation: “Because it is a metalanguage, it can handle all the codes, create metaphors, move from one domain to an other; assemble them and pull them apart” (1998, 5). Body “language” does not operate as a metalanguage, however: “the body does not speak, it makes speech” (1998, 5). Sensing, the body responds to various strata and textures of articulation and gesture, incorporating and excreting the myriad incongruities of any encounter, be it sensual and/or textual, with an other. It is therefore a fal- lacy to consider the body linguistically without acknowledging the complex layering of the senses, for the body is, ﬁrst and foremost, a sensual apparatus of movement toward the world, a sensing body-in-motion that worlds. This is not to undermine the importance of a textual language of gesture, or of a “grammar” of the body, but rather to underscore the importance of con- ceiving the body as movement.
If the body cannot be reduced to a language, how can we speak of the body? How can we articulate touch as a mechanism in and of the body? How can we locate the importance of the concept of touch for the political? And, ultimately, how can we disentangle the body from the straitjacket of the nationally and state-sanctioned body-politic? Perhaps we can begin by sug- gesting that space is “modeled” by the body itself (Gil 1998, 17). If space is no longer something the body “inhabits,” where space is conceived of as a pre- made container for the body, we can begin to think of the body as a mecha- nism for reaching out across and instantiating time and space. As Gil writes,
