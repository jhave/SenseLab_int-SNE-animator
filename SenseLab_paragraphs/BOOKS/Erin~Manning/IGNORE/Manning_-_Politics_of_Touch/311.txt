1975, 34). Here, the senses function as windows to the soul. The Christian Cicero, Lactantius (A.D. 260–A.D. 340), suggests that the soul lives inside the senses. Yet, following an already well-established tradition, Lactantius does warn against the pleasures of the senses (touch in particular), reminding us that pleasures must be subdued by virtue. For Lactantius, touch is the most dangerous of all senses. Lactan- tius sees touch as linked ﬁrst to sexual pleasure, and hence “to be kept back most of all, as it damages most of all” (1918, 563).
The focus on the mind in opposition to the senses is carried out through the six- teenth and seventeenth centuries in the work of philosophers such as Descartes (1596–1650), whose writing rests on the problem of whether the mind works inde- pendently of the senses, or whether sense-experiences are necessary for the forma- tion of concepts. Yet, despite the hierarchies of mind and body within Descartes’s work, a strange tendency lurks, whereby there seems to be an admission that the senses often resist the organization of the body as reasoning/sensing duality. This is more boldly apparent in Pierre Gassendi’s writing (1592–1655), a contemporary of Descartes: “every idea in the mind has its origin in the senses. Every idea either goes through a sense, or is formed by what goes through a sense” (1992, 92). Locke (1632– 1704), much closer to Gassendi than to Descartes, suggests that sensation and reﬂec- tion are the two sources of knowledge (1823, 141).
Following Locke, Diderot (1713–84) argues that touch is the most profound and most philosophical of the senses. Condillac (1714–80) adds that “touch, and touch only, instructs the other senses as to orientation, movement and activity” (1:222), stating further that all of our knowledge comes from the senses. Yet the mind con- tinues even here to preside over the body, as sustained by Diderot’s claim that “rea- son, although dependent on the senses, has authority over them, and as it cannot be reduced to mere sensation, the individual intellectual differences, not the quality of the sensations, ultimately determine judgment and character” (in Vinge 1975, 140). Rousseau (1844–1910) displays Descartes’s inﬂuence when he argues that sensation and judgment cannot be the same: “My will is independent of my senses” (1962, 123).
