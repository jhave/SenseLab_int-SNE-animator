Symbiosis evolves from the need to repair cellular DNA through the incor- poration of the adjacent cell’s DNA. As Deleuze and Guattari underline, the organism’s capacity for reproduction also conﬁrms its capacity for deter- ritorialization: “The more interior milieus an organism has... assuring its autonomy and bringing it into a set of aleatory relations with the exterior, the more deterritorialized it is” (1987, 53–54). If reproduction depends on deterritorialization, species must not simply be reproduced qua species.
