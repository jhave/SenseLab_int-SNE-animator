politics that might begin to acknowledge (and sense) our bodies differently. Tango is often exoticized (both by those regarding from the outside and those dancing) precisely because it threatens the organizing of social and political locales that depend on national and state limits of identity and ter- ritory. This is why within nation-state vocabularies of identity and territory, tango will continue to be located as the Argentinean dance of national identity, as the stable rendition of passion and loss experienced by immi- grants to Buenos Aires in the early twentieth century and embodied today by many Argentines, in particular the porteños of Buenos Aires.
But there are other stories, and these continuously leak out from under  the nationalized mantle of tango, infringing on the tangos danced elsewhere (where the “elsewhere” also includes Buenos Aires), impinging on repre- sentations of national identity through dance, challenging bodies in move- ment with improvisations that exceed representations of national identity and cultural territoriality. These tangos challenge race, class, and gender/ sexual distinctions without being tied down to an imaginary of national identity. These tangos acts as reminders that national identity is never more than a dream, personiﬁed by a lamp of the Iguazu Falls. Despite their pre- tenses to the contrary, discourses of identity and territory are not easy to maintain. Even our best intentions cannot silence the multiplicities within identity practices. This is apparent in tango, that double-edged sword that both places Buenos Aires on the map of the world and traces all of the lines of ﬂight enabled and instantiated by its politics of touch. Tango is not satisﬁed by territoriality, just as touch is never a moment that can be encaged within a spatio-temporality. Tango depends on movement, on recordings that cross nations and continents, on improvisations that never make their way home, wherever that is.
