Expressions of the Political
Brian Massumi writes: “The world does not exist outside of its expressions” (2002b, xiii).1 Expressions are not simply representations, descriptions, content-driven empirical correspondences. Expressions cannot be reduced to external forces reacting upon a body. Expressions are in and of the body, sensual and sensing:
The force of expression... strikes the body ﬁrst, directly and unmediately. It passes transformatively through the ﬂesh before being instantiated in subject-positions subsumed by a system of power. Its immediate effect is a differing. The body, fresh in the throes of expression, incarnates not an already-formed system but a modiﬁcation—a change. Expression is an event. (Massumi 2002b, xvii)
