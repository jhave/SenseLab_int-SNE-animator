A new concept of population emerges when fully determinate and dis- crete units are no longer operative as the precursors of an evolutionary model that relies on self-contained genetic units along pre-formed evolu- tionary linkages. As Ansell Pearson writes: “On the Weismannian17 model, evolution is reduced to a predetermined genetic programme proceeding via the elimination and extermination of the unﬁt. But such a notion of evolu- tion is bound up with a particular conception of individuals as determinate and discrete, functioning as closed systems” (1999, 167). When evolution is used as a calculational process, individuals become the impetus for survival. Genes become the immortal actors in the ﬁght for continuity. Bodies are conceptualized according to strict codes of conduct (Rayner 1997, 70). This results in classiﬁcatory differences that are embedded in certain ideologies that already consider certain kinds of reproduction or survival to be of utmost consequence. Creative becoming is not at stake here. What is at stake is a continued re-instantiation of roles of speciation, including those of sex and gender.
In  Symbiotic  Planet,  Lynn  Margulis  emphasizes  three  main  points:
(1) Human similarities to other life forms are far more striking than the dif- ferences; (2) Humans are not “better,” “more proliﬁc,” or “more advanced” than any other species; (3) We live on a symbiotic planet. Endosymbiosis extends beyond the biological to the cultural and political realms. Genetic alterations brought about by symbiosis are translated in social and political realms into stereotypes that can also be symbiotically recombined. Forms are altered by matter that does not necessarily take the shape we presup- pose. Symbiosis produces engenderings that defy the imagination, opening our worlds to the potential of qualitative change. Relation takes the place
