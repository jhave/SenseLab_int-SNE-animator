to the potential politics of a democracy-to-come; it exposes itself to a Spinozean concept of Nature as immanence rather than transcendence. A politics of touch is a far-from-equilibrium system insofar as it “is neither the reversible system of classical dynamics nor a condition of constant ﬂux unrecognizable as a system” (Connolly 2002, 56). In Prigogine’s words: “Matter near equilibrium behaves in a ‘repetitive’ way. On an other hand,... far from equilibrium we may witness the appearance of... a mechanism of ‘communication’ among molecules. Within this mechanism succes- sive repetitions are not identical to each other because they rise out of highly sensi- tized responses to ‘initial conditions’ that exceed the reach of our capacities for close delineation” (in Connolly 2002, 56). Far-from-equilibrium systems encourage emergence in all ﬁelds. Stengers, for example, sees science as “a shifting and dissonant dialogue between human assemblages and nonhuman assemblages” (in Connolly 2002, 58).
17. Brian Massumi writes: “There is a difference between the possible and the potential.... Possibility is back-formed from potential’s unfolding. But once it is formed, it also effectively feeds in. Feedback, it prescripts: implicit in the determina- tion of a thing’s or body’s positionality is a certain set of transformations that can be expected of it by deﬁnition and that it can therefore undergo without qualitatively changing enough to warrant a new name.... Possibility is a variation implicit in what a thing can be said to be when it is on target. Potential is the immanence of a thing to its still indeterminate variation, under way.... Implication is a code word. Immanence is process” (2002a, 9).
