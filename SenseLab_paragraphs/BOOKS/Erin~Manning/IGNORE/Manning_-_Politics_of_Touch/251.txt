could not ﬁx any beginning, end, or direction, it could not distribute any diversity, if it did not transcend itself toward an instance capable of relating the diverse to the form of a subject’s identity, or to the form of an object’s
or a world’s permanence, which one assumes to be present from beginning to end. Conversely, this form of identity within common sense would remain empty if it did not transcend itself toward an instance capable of determin- ing it by means of a particular diversity, which would begin here, end there, and which one would suppose to last as long as it is necessary to assure the equalization of its parts. It is necessary that quality be at once stopped and measured, attributed and identiﬁed. In this complementarity of good sense and common sense, the alliance between the self, the world, and God is sealed—God being the ﬁnal outcome of directions and the supreme  principle of identities. (1990b, 78)
Good sense and common sense unite to hold the world to a measure that can purportedly be codiﬁed as a system. Emergence of new ways of thinking are painstakingly kept at bay by the gatekeepers of good and common sense. Yet invariably, expression occurs despite (or even because of) good sense and common sense in an eruption that exceeds the strata of signiﬁcation on which good sense and common sense rely. Sense erupts in the fragility of the moment where surface meets surface and is re-ﬁtted as formed-matter and mattered-form, metastable, passionate, movemented, active. Sense is the effect of corporeal causes and their mixtures, alive with the impossibility of accurately determining the gap between inside and outside, event and prob- lem, sense and making sense. Fragile, expressive.
