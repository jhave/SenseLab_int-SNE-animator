here perhaps still too strongly linked to individual subjectivities. Bodies do not only share. They reach. To reach is not a condition of possibility: it is potentiality17 —that which is not already known, embodied, experienced. “One would ﬁrst need to learn how to think the ‘each’ on the basis of the series or best works of singular ‘each times’” (Nancy 1994, 71). Politics: disorder, rogue states, untouchability. Touch: reaching toward, movement. A politics of touch stages an approach. Rogue states are dangerous: is there any other kind of state? My BwO becomes a war machine, imperceptibly, momentarily. Touching, I space you, us. I do not deﬁne a new state. I matter differently.
The rational modern subject that is at the heart of state sovereignty is a political technology—a posthuman BwO—that implodes the body, draw- ing its vectors of resonance into collusion with governmental power. Gov- ernmentality requires security. Bodies must be contained, maintained. And yet, as Hardt and Negri point out, modern sovereignty cannot be conceived of as a linear, all-encompassing event.
Modernity is divided between a radical revolutionary process and a counter-revolution that seeks to dominate and expropriate the force of emerging movements and dynamics: in the interplay between the plane of immanence, where a consciousness of freedom and scientiﬁc politics opens the way for a democratic politics, and the dominant theme of the Enlight- enment, which closes down the movement that characterizes the plane of immanence, we witness the double-bind of sovereign politics today (Hardt and Negri 2000, 74).
