time, we would do well to follow the Spinozean route at least as far as to remember that there is no essential dichotomy between states and Nature. Bodies coexist as they correlate. State bodies are not fundamentally differ- ent from other kinds of bodies. The difference is that the body the state his- torically represents, as Nietzsche points out, is a body that agrees to or is in- cited to be governed in particular ways. In Hobbes, the sovereign embodies an exchange between freedom and security that combines the individual and sovereign subjects (the state and the citizen) into a single ﬁgure. The Hobbesean citizen becomes the rational modern subject who is represented as anything but a sensing body in movement. There is such a stagnancy in the concept of the modern subject as to suggest that the sovereign body is a still-life in the imaginary representation of the territorial nation-state.
In Rogues, Derrida presents once more his concept of a democracy-to- come, this time in the name of rogue states. He writes: “The democratic is possibly impossible and the political possibly possible” (2005, 46). Quoting Nancy, Derrida suggests that politics has not yet been capable of thinking democracy, nor democracy the political.
It is possible that for this reason it may no longer even be possible, in the future, to think in terms of “democracy,” and it is possible that this also signiﬁes a general displacement of “the political,” a word we have pro- visionally mobilized here: perhaps a liberation of the political itself. All things considered, what is lacking is a thinking of the freedom that is not established, but that takes itself in the act of its beginning and its recommence- ment. This remains for us to consider, perhaps beyond our entire political tradition—and yet in some ways the direction of this imperative has already been thought by at least one part of the revolutionary tradition.
