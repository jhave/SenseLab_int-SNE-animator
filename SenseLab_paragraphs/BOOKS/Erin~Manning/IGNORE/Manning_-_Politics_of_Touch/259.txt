You will be organized, you will be an organism, you will articulate your body—otherwise you’re just depraved. You will be signiﬁer and signi- ﬁed, interpreter and interpreted—otherwise you’re just deviant. You will be a subject, nailed down as one, a subject of the enunciation revealed into a subject of the statement—otherwise you’re just a tramp.
(1987, 159)
