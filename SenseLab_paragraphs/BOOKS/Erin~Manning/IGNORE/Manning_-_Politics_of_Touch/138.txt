threatens the very juridical order that sustains the state. “Law,” writes Der- rida, “has an interest in the monopoly of violence” (1992, 33). This monop- oly protects not legal ends, but law itself. Violence threatens from within, operating at the heart of state-sanctioned law-making practices. To think violence as that which does not emerge from the law’s exterior is to under- stand the implicit violence in state formations: “The foundation of all States occurs in a situation that we can call revolutionary. It inaugurates a new law, it always does so in violence” (Derrida 1992, 35).
Yet even within the state model, the body remains an agent of juxtaposi- tion and transformation, for the body can never be completely incorpo- rated within the semantics of the nation-state and its body-politic. Situated practices alter the body as the body alters these very practices. Allen Feld- man writes: “The cultural construction of the political subject is tied to the cultural construction of history. This intersection results in political agency as an embodied force” (1991, 2). Political agency here is achieved not as a given but on the basis of a practice that alters the body: political agency is conceived of as an effect of situated practices. This view of political agency is supported by Nietzsche’s concept of work, where agency is understood not as the state of the political body itself, but as the product of that body’s work. It is important to hold to this supplemental relation of the passive and the active body in order not to fall prey to the mythologizing renditions of a body-in-process that focus not on the movements themselves but on the mythos of a stable, coherent body:
