Manifestation and signiﬁcation, both usually associated with the political, are cast aside in favor of a politics that seeks to reach a region where lan- guage no longer simply seeks to relate to that which it denotes, but also to that which it expresses, which it senses. The duality within politics (making sense and sensing) thus falls apart.
Deleuze writes:
Sense is never only one of the two terms of the duality which contrasts things and propositions, substantives and verbs, denotations and expressions; it is also the frontier, the cutting edge, or the articulation of the difference be- tween the two terms, since it has at its disposal an impenetrability which is its own and within which it is reﬂected.
