it accountable (in terms of gender, race, ethnicity, class), but an individua- tion that foregrounds the aporia at work within a concept of the political. What is initiated by the aporia is a thinking of justice. Equality, within a democracy-to-come, is a demand for an idea of freedom that would expand beyond the count itself. In aporetic space-time an opening is made for a relation that functions according to the n+1. To count (to account for) is both to count again and to add to the count. This multiplication process requires a response. The ability to respond propels not the closure of the aporia but its continual reopenings. The time of democracy must remain
aporetic. Derrida writes:
Politico-juridico-ethical responsibility gets determined and becomes name- able, given some degree of semantic stability, only with the imposition of precisely that which is contained within parentheses, namely, the technique of equality, justice in the sense of calculable right or law, what Nancy also calls “given conditions,” and especially criteria for “negotiations” to measure this access against the incommensurable, which, in itself and by deﬁnition, excludes all given criteria, all calculable rules, all measure. (2005, 52)
Whether or not we fall prey to the myth of the measure of equality within a system of calculation, a politics of touch is a reminder that the measure is never more than an attempt to reconsign the incommensurable. Justice,13 in this regard, is always a renegotiation of the incommensurability of liberty and equality. Justice is democratic and democracy is just because justice must be about making a decision, about taking response-ability (even when I return to the grid to count the squares of equality and liberty), about fac- ing the abyss of the incommensurable.
