ing bodies in movement, relating the narratives of super-sensory giants who are now imprisoned. Sensuality that is restrained to the surface must escape, must become Godly, must expand beyond the strict envelope of the body’s skin. “God only Acts & Is, in existing beings of Men” (1975, 16–17, xxiii). “For every thing that lives is Holy,” writes Blake at the end of The Mar- riage of Heaven and Hell (1975, 27, xxviii). Holiness is not bodilessness but its opposite. The more sense-perceptive, the holier. The body that emerges as the holy body is a body that is eminently touchable, though always slightly out of reach as it extends toward the world. The body is ﬂuidly sensual, sensingly ﬂuid, transforming itself beyond notions of discrete insides and outsides. The body is beside itself, corporeal, reaching, sensing, experienc- ing. This is not an innocent or a nonviolent body. It is a body that experi- ences the world in touch with the potential violence that is the rupture toward the unknowable. As Blake writes in Jerusalem, “if Perceptive Organs vary: Objects of Perception seem to vary: / if the Perceptive Organs close: the Objects seem to close also” (1991b, 30, 34). The world corresponds to
the variations of the senses that perceive it.
A sensing body is an inﬁnite body. Inﬁnity is not eternity. A sensing body does not return to the garden nor does it perform miracles through touch. A sensing body ruptures conceptions of time and space that are considered stable, reaching toward a continued metamorphosis of the body that vio- lently spaces time and times space. Acute senses allow the world to appear in relation. Bodies are qualitatively altered by sense. Bodies emerge as multi- tudes, inﬁnitely sensing in excess of their organisms, reaching toward songs of experience. “We live as one man; for contracting our inﬁnite senses / We behold multitude; or expanding; we behold as one” (1991b, 38, 34, 17–19).
