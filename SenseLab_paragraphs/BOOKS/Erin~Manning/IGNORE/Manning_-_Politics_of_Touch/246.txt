or substitutes itself, the supplement is exterior, outside of the positivity to which it is super-added, alien to that which, in order to be replaced by it, must be other than it. (Derrida 1974, 145)
The senses supplement sense: external and internal to sense-as-signiﬁcation, the senses extend what it is to “know,” challenging implicitly the manner in which the conditioning of sense continues to be allocated to a strict econ- omy of reason as extrinsic from the body. Sense, sensing, senses, making sense, making senses supplement signiﬁcation by rendering it bodily, by adding to the body, by extending the capacity to know into a sensual appa- ratus. Signiﬁcation is sensual, it turns out, and politics make sense.
If political thought is reoriented toward practices of sense that compli- cate teleologies of signiﬁcation, the political emerges as a virtual embodi- ment of sensations of difference rather than an actual mold of “good” sense. A politics of touch resists a reorientation toward the dichotomy between here and there, good and evil, sense and signiﬁcation. Politics of touch thereby avoids strict conditions of denotation, extending itself toward expression:
The duality in the proposition is not between two sorts of names, names of stasis and names of becoming, names of substances or qualities and names of events; rather, it is between two dimensions of the proposition, that is, between denotation and expression, or between the denotation of things and the expression of sense. (Deleuze 1990b, 25)
