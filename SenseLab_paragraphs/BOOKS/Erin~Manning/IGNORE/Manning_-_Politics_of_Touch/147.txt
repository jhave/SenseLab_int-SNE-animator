Erring
The violence of a politics of touch can be conceived as a certain erring toward an other. Derrida writes: “Like pure violence, pure nonviolence is a contradictory concept.”
A Being without violence would be a Being which would occur outside the existent: nothing; nonhistory; nonoccurence; nonphenomenality. A speech produced without the least violence would determine nothing, would say nothing, would offer nothing to an other; it would not be history, and it would show nothing; in every sense of the word, and ﬁrst of all the Greek sense, it would be speech without a phrase. (1978, 146–47)
A critique of violence embodied through a politics of touch engages in the interstices of violence where violence does not seek to uphold law but to creatively propel contradictory readings of juxtaposition and relation. Cri- tiques of violence will remain violent, with the goal of producing a concept of violence that escapes the strict dichotomy between law-making and law- preserving violence.9 I denounce violence while negotiating the violence of the denunciation. The question is: Can I do so without mobilizing a vio- lence of my own that projects a new kind of founding violence?
Derrida asks: “Can [critiques of violence] do justice without doing justice to this justice?” (1978, 147). The violence of the concept is what it at stake here. A politics of touch is violent in its very articulation. It is violent because it tears the fabric of state politics in order to ask about the relation between touch and violence. It is violent because it raises questions about how erring toward experience must lead toward the unknowable. Touch is not impervious to an economy of violence. Entering an economy of violence is to engage the relation between touch and untouchability, between touch as reaching and touch as an erring that never quite succeeds in ﬁnalizing its
