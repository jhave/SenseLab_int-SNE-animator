The tango embrace is the political gesture with which the mediality of tango is initiated. It is this embrace which invites the potential emergence of a medium, a milieu independent of pre-ordained constraints. This medium can feed an already troubled relationship between self and other, between woman and man, leader and follower. In this case, the embrace is a means to an end, signaling a familiar restoring of the genre. Or this embrace can challenge the concept of the milieu through a politics of touch that engages in the means, that is, in the potential of listening to the breath, the body, the distance and the closeness of another human being, a listening to what might be considered the very ethics-in-deconstruction of humanity.2
Agamben writes, “because being-in-language is not something that could be said in sentences, the gesture is essentially always a gesture of not being able to ﬁgure something out in language” (2000, 58). The gesture of turning to an other, of inventing a movement with another whom I do not know and cannot anticipate, is a gesture attentive to a resounding silence, in which I am exposed as a body in motion. In the case of tango, my language is what I reveal to you in the intimacy of the embrace, a language that introduces you to a movement that invites you to respond to a direction we initiate together.
