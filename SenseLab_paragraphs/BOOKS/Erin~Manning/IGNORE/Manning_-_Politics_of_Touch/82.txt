Tango Movements
The tango as it is portrayed in Happy Together is one of the most multi- faceted portrayals available on ﬁlm today, interesting not only because of the complexity of its identiﬁcation with the dance, but also because it challenges the roles of the leader and the follower, of the national and the transnational, of the homed and the unhomed. This (despite the rendering of an exoticized tango for consumption) is always-already inscribed in the (hi)story of the tango, a dance that has, from its beginnings, spanned the globe, gaining im- portance not as a dance located in Buenos Aires, but as a dance that travels.
