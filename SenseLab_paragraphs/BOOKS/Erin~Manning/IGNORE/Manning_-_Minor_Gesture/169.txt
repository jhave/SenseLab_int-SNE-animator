2 I have developed relational movement as a concept in both Politics of Touch
(2007) and Relationscapes (2009).
3 I discuss this concept more fully in “Propositions for the Verge” in Manning 2013.
4 For a more in-depth exploration of the concept of likeness, see “The Thinking- Feeling of What Happens” in Massumi 2011. I also explore the relationship between likeness and counterpoint in “Another Regard” in Manning 2013.
5 See “Dancing the Virtual” in Manning 2013 for a more comprehensive reading of technique and technicity.
6 In Always More Than One (Manning 2013), I have an interlude entitled Fiery, Luminous, Scary that explores these questions in relation to a work of mine entitled Slow Clothes || Folds to Infinity. It seems to me that the demands of relational or participatory art are such that the creation of conditions for par- ticipation must be crafted with as much attention as the objects themselves receive (if there are objects). The art here is precisely the art of relation.
