Limits of Existence
To explore the art of participation, it is necessary to return to a few key issues raised earlier around the notion of the art of time:
1. What is activated by an artwork is not its objecthood (an object in itself is not art). Art is the way, the manner of becoming that is in- tensified by the coming-out-of-itself of an object. It is the object’s outdoing as form or content.
2. Intuition is the work that sets the process of outdoing on its way.
3. The manner of becoming makes time felt in the complexity of its nonlinear duration. This is an activation of the future—the force of making-felt what remains unthinkable (on the edge of feeling).
4. The activation of the manner of becoming is another way of talking about the work’s technicity, or its more-than. This more-than is a dephasing of the work from its initial proposition (its material, its conditions of existence).
5. The relational field activated by the work’s outdoing of itself is a more-than-human ecology of practices. Relationally, ecologically, the work participates in a worlding that potentially redefines the limits of existence.
Limits of existence are always under revision. The art of participation takes the notion of modes of existence as its starting point, asking how the conditions that orient it toward its more-than modify or modulate how art can make a difference, opening up the existing fields of relation toward new forms of perception, accountability, experience, and collectivity. This aspect of the art of participation cannot be thought separately from the political, even though the work’s political force is not necessarily in its con- tent. This is not about making the form of art political. It is about asking how the field of relation activated by art can affect the complex ecologies of which it is part.
