Remember that my body and its “orbit” include my thoughts, my real emotions, and what I call my “feelings.” These are not the same as what you people, i.e. neurotypicals, call “feelings” but are my carrying . . . vibrations, ﬂashes, visual-blocks, touch-horrors, smell-tickles and the
cross-over that comes from them.
