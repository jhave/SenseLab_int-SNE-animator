In addition to siting awareness, “Dress Becomes Body” architects mobility. Architecting mobility does not mean creating a site for mobility. It refers instead to a way of understanding the siting of awareness through a focus on the force of form. A choreographic architecture dances attention, siting an event in the midst of its potentiality. When a choreographic architecture comes to the fore, what is perceived, what is lived, is not the siting of the body but the fielding of its mobility.
It is here, in the differential folding of the choreographic potential of mobile architectings, that fashion and architecture most readily meet. For when fashion becomes procedural, what it does is assist us in attending to how a bodying is already an architecting of mobility at a different scale.
