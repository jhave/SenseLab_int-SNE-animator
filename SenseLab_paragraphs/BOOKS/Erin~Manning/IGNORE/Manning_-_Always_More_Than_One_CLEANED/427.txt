Force of Form
A dance of attention has its own technicity. For each work—be it a choreography, a performance installation, a musical composition—a rigorous setting into place of conditions is necessary. These conditions are always specific to the event but never completely stable across its iterations. Each iteration of the event dephases the memory of its having come into existence. No movement can be cued, aligned to, or performed in exactly the same way twice. Conditions are pragmatic and based, always, on the elastic now of event-time as it makes itself felt.
