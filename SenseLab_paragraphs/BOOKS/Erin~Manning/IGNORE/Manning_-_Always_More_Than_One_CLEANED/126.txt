Collective Individuation
There is no body that isn’t always already collective, always already active in the relational interweaving of more than one tending, more than one phase, more than one ecology in the making. “[T]he different faces of affect create insertions at the level of the becoming of life itself, not at the level of individual becoming” (Simondon 1989, 120). Affect’s transductive potential cuts across individuality, moving the bodying toward the collective agitation of its preindividual potential. In its cutting-across, affect does not dismantle the body (the body is not yet): it multiplies it. Affective transduction is invention: it creates new processes for life in its creative advance.
Affect never locates itself once and for all on an individual body. Affect courses across, grouping into tendential relation not individual feelings but preindividual feeling-tendencies. As a collective force, it brings into welling formation the individual and the preindividual at the limit of their coexistence. For it is as emergent collective forces that these two tendencies coincide. When life’s process seeks to resolve itself in individuals by individuals and for individuals, the force of the collective gives way to the personal and the project of a life gives way to the bounded notion of this life. From the spiral of eternal return to the hierarchies of many-headed liberal humanisms, individuation of and for the individual alone brings about the death of the collective as a project for life and, with it, the imminent undoing of the force of a life coursing through individuation.
