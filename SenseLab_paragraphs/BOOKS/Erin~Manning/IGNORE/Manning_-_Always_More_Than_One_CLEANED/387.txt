On the second day, it occured to me to ask DJ to tell me about his experience of the space. Was an environment of my creation also an opening to him? Did he think Folds to Infinity’s mobile architecture as I had conceived it could be a generative proposition for other autistics? After some reflection, DJ suggested that the installation might not cater to all kinds of movement, and that it might in fact not foreground movement enough. We followed through with this proposition, discussing the possibility of bringing the work to autcoM in the form of a mobile experiment that would use participants’ wheelchairs themselves as metallic architectures. Although we did not ultimately follow through with this, it became the first clue: Perhaps to “create” play was to allow the artwork to travel on its own? To make movement its subject as well as its outcome?
