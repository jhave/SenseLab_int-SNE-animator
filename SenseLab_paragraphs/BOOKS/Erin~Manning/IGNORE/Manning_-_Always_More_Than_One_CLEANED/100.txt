This is why Simondon rejects hylomorphism: hylomorphismâ€™s claim that there is a hierarchy of form over matter discredits both the processual and the becoming of continuity. The nowness of an individuation momentarily resolving itself into this or that is only a fleeting point within a larger process of individuation that has not yet claimed a stable relationship between matter and form. A body in the extended sense is the complexity of a multiplicity of the phasings that co-constitutes it, a society in motion, a resonant materiality, a metastable field. Continuity and discontinuity commingling to activate the singular in a field of difference.
