In the realm of pure experience—the virtual pole of the edge of experience in-forming—the affective resonance of the not-yet agitates, thought in germ. Where thought fields more than it forms, language as such does not yet exist. But even where language is not-yet, there is nonetheless within thought-thinking a drifting, a rhythmic shifting, a polyphonic multiplicity in germ ready to be activated, to be articulated, be it in words, in movement, in gesture. When language composes with this more-than, it brings to the fore the fragility of all forms of expression, including signification, alerting us to the complex tectonic forces of the “immanence of the finite in the multitude” (Simondon 1958, 28).
