In the poetic language of classical autism, language is a sensing practice in its own right—a field of affective tonality activated in rhythms and tones, in speeds and intensities. Here, the turn toward expression does not cut itself off from the experiential vastness of sensation and perception but writes with them. A language in the moving makes itself felt: “yes. dearest sad dad you heard fresh self and freshly responded deserting your fears and just freed sad dear saved me. yes. yes. yes. yes” (DJ Savarese). Expression here makes felt the agitation that resonates at the very edges of expressibility. The result: language becomes force of expression, the more-than of subtraction. We hear language dance in new and singular ways with adjectives and adverbs modifying the situation rather than simply the nouns, we hear with the force of qualifiers intensities never before articulated quite this way, we hear voices being given to the fields of relation, to objects-becoming-fields, rather than simply to individuals. “Larry is mighty proud to movie star you people of lipsticked words of appreciation loving our movie mouthing off at our mostly poor jokes is fine voting for us as people magazine worthy.”11 “Hours of light like heat hibernate/great icebergs hear the cries of the hurt” (DJ Savarese qtd. in Ralph Savarese, forthcoming).
