Composing-with, on the other hand, suggests a commitment to making the pure experience of the more-than of expression felt. This is an ecological approach to language. It does not seek to delimit or deny the complexities (and unsayabilities) of expressibility. Rather, it addresses the fullness of autistic experience, adding to it another modality: words. Maurice’s approach to “coming back” to language is quite the opposite. Within her model, everything that connects to autism is dangerous and is, as a result, denied. For this reason, in the behavioral therapy she claims “cured” her children, consistent effort was made to distract Anne-Marie and Michel from any kind of daydreaming (being “lost in space”) that appeared “autistic.” During therapeutic sessions, the children were also repeatedly made to look into the aide’s eyes (and later the mother’s eyes), even if this meant forcefully holding their chin. They were also discouraged from engaging in any kind of rhythmic repetitions of language or echolalia that might be associated with parroting or stimming on a word.
