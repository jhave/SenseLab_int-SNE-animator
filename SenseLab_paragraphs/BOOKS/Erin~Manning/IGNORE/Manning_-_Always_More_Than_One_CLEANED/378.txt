In the context of a project such as Folds to Infinity, participation means many things: it means to walk among the fabrics and enjoy their texture, to touch or wear the fabrics, to reposition or compose with them architecturally, to assist an other who is trying to compose clothing but can’t quite manage on their own, to be inadvertently connected to the magnets interspersed in the collection (your belt buckle or purse magnet may pull the fabric off someone else’s body or shift the shape of the installation). The invitation is broad: touch, move, be moved.
