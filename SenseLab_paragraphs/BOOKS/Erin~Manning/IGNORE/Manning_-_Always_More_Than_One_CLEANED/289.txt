The taking-form of movement is rhythmic. Rhythm is another way of evoking the multiplicity of time-slips of experience in any given occasion. Rhythm is not added to movement from outside its taking-form. Rhythm is what gives time to incipient movement, characterizing that movement’s singular in-timeness as it verges into event. This in-timeness is not strictly a beat or a measure. Despite appearances, rhythm is qualitative more than quantitative, a field of resonance that is coterminous with the incipiency of the movement’s preacceleration and the elasticity of its unfolding.12 It is qualitative in part because it challenges the pre-setting of movement into time: rhythm cuts across measure, bringing into collusion the how of movement-moving in the now of its unfolding. This how of movementmoving in the timeliness of the qualitative now of its unfolding is what I am calling movement’s time signature. When Forsythe sounds movement he is not simply marking time’s measure. He is activating the rhythm of the breath as time signature in direct co-composition with movement-moving. Sound and movement are one. Rhythm is what makes felt, in the moving, the interplay between the microperceptual and micromovements, activating for experience the force of movement’s time.
