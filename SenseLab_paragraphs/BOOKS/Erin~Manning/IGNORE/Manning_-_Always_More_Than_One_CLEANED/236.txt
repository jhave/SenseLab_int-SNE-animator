Waltz with Bashir does this by taking a protopolitical stance: we must be wary of identifying too strongly with the face, for the face is a dangerous propositionâ€”either we recognize it as our own, or we turn away from it in horror.32 The face must remain a topological surface equal to all other surfacings: it must not territorialize too quickly onto an identity, onto an individual, onto the Jew or the Palestinian. Because if it does, we will have positioned ourselves in advance, and we will already have succumbed to the most potentially racist of subject-object positions.
