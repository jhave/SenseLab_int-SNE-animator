Living in time means activating, in the moving, the déjà-felt in all of its uncanniness. Memory, for Bergson, is not something stored and subsequently recollected. As apparent in Waltz with Bashir, memory in the making is the activation of the power of the false that re-creates the present through a complex remix of fabulation and pastness beyond any notion of the “true.” In the context of a choreographic practice, memory straddles technique and technicity, giving the event its durational quality, creating a platform for a body to become an ecology of a multitude of durational times interwoven.
Memory and perception are of a different order yet inextricably linked, “always interpenetrat[ing] each other, . . . always exchanging something of their substance as by a process of endosmosis” (Bergson 1939, 67). When a dancer moves, the movement is implicit in her perception of it, which is itself part memory. When we watch a dancer move, the movement perceived is similarly already imbricated in the memory of the previous movement coursing through it (and through us). Each movement is alive with a memory that activates the becoming-body, including that of the spectator. This activation is not the recall of an actual movement: we wouldn’t have time to consciously perceive and remember and move a movement at the same time. The memory is always living, a force of activation ensconced in the futurepresentness of discovering the feeling of movement again for the first time. This is also the case in everyday movement.
Take the walk. The walk’s unfolding as horizontality depends on finding within its quality of movement the doubleness of its point of virtual departure and arrival. This bi-directional betweenness is what gives the movement its horizontalizing consistency. It is through the virtual interval of the walk’s preacceleration that walking is transformed from a step into a movement.
