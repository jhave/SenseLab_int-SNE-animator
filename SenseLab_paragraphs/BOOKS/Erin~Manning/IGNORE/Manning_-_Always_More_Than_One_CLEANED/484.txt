To compose-with is to place language within an ecology of practices. It is to think-with in the time of the utterance’s becoming-expression. To compose-with is to collectively write time in the shaping.17 Soma Mukhopadhyay, who facilitated her son Tito’s entry into language through a method she calls rapid prompting, emphasizes his strange relationship to time. Even with language, she suggests, her son continues to have an unusual relationship to time: he experiences intense anxiety because he is incapable of anticipating what comes next. Tito Mukhopadhyay’s experience of the world, even as he is capable of articulately composing-with literary pasts and futures, continues to dwell in the now of experience in the making (Iversen 2006, 143). This suggests that language does not necessarily produce a sensation of time in itself, even as it gives time to the shaping of experience. Language awakens the potential of multiplications of expressibility—“As I began to type, my mind began to wake up” (Sue Rubin)—giving a duration to expression that favors a certain notion of intelligibility, but it does not entirely overwrite the complexity of experience.18 In giving voice to experience, it structures time, but within that structure there remains a tinge of the virtual stratum of polyphonous indefiniteness which is pure experience. Language is both more-than and less-than: it brings to expression the world in time even as it agitates the complex timeless interminglings of pure experience.
