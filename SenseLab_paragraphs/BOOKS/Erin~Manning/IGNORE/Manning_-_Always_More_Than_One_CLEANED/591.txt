Vitality forms “are the most fundamental of all felt experience.” They are inherent in each coming-to-act, bringing forth a speciation that always exceeds containment (Stern 2010, 8). These speciations occur in the between of experience and experiencing where embodiment is not-yet. They meet as tendencies, as proclivities. Arm meets rosebush to become gardeningtendency, thorn meets sound to become weapon, disintegrating rock meets water to become raft. Bodies, life-forms do emerge, but never as fully formed, never “as such”: something always escapes the delineation of the coming-to-act, and something always exceeds it. The body, the individual, life as such is but a shorthand for a million speciations, organic and inorganic, intertwining.
