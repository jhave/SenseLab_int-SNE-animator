For Forsythe, the durational field of the dance is propositional: it is configuring more than configured. This despite the long hours of rehearsal and the complex movement vocabularies for cueing and aligning invented and studied by his excellent dancers. The choreography is configuring rather than simply configured because the choreographic field is itself continuously evolving through the cueing/aligning process. We experience the complexity of this evolution when we approach One Flat Thing, reproduced as an open field of distributed relational movement that operates with but also in excess of the human body: the cue lands nonlocally, meeting the dancer in the between of movements-moving. The dancer cues or aligns not by stopping the movement but by engaging directly with the nonlocal interval of the cue as it meets movement-moving. The resulting movement moves the relation between cueing and aligning in the mode, always, of the alreadymobile. The dancer does not watch, think, count, decide, and then move. The cue moves the dance, and in the choreographic fieldâ€™s subsequent realigning, dancers land position, continuously moving through relational posture.
