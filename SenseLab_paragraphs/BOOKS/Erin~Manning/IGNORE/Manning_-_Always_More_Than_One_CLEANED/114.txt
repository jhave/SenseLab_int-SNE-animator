Lures for feeling do not achieve form per se. They generate attunements, tendencies, force of form. This is why Whitehead speaks of “subjective form” more than of form itself. What an occasion ultimately achieves is strictly speaking not a form but a tending, a mobile ecology. An occasion is less an object or a body than a node of relation expressing itself momentarily as this or that—an edging into object, a swerving into body. The how or the expressivity of this relational node is the occasion’s subjective form. “[T]here are many species of subjective forms, such as emotions, valuations, purposes, adversions, aversions, consciousness, etc.” (Whitehead 1978, 24). The subjective form of an event is how an occasion of experience has come to feel itself in the culmination of this or that process. While the culmination of a process into this or that subjective form has a definite endpoint, the affective tonality of the now perishing occasion will continue to color the process of the occasion shifting from its determinate nature to its perishing on the nexus of experience. From appetite to event back to appetite.
