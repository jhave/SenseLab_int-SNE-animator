The next music video is of a completely different order. It is subtle and graceful, with Bach’s Concerto no. 5 overlaying a surreal scene of soldiers walking in slow motion through a forest, their fatigues melding into the dappled green of the leaves, their faces impassive in a tense atmosphere of fear. Juxtaposed to the previous music video of macho images of men surfing and killing to rock music, this music video plays on the uneasy silence where beauty and terror coincide. For one minute, we watch as soldiers move very slowly, their guns poised, their bodies tense, while in the background, juxtaposed to the slowness of the soldiers’ movement, we catch a quick glimpse of two children crouching under trees, running from one hideout to another, looking for the perfect aim. And then, still in slow motion, one of the children launches a missile and we watch as it moves slowly, slowly, through the two straight lines of soldiers walking toward us, targeting the tank behind them. The missile inches in flight between them, Bach’s oncerto playing uninterrupted, the missile’s sudden hit causing the soldiers to fall forward in a collective choreography of bodies lowering, their faces still impassive (see figure 5). Then, in unison, the soldiers raise their faces and continue to move forward, crouching along the ground, crawling off into the distance.
