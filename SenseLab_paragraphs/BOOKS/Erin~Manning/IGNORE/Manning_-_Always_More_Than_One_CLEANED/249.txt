This chapter takes on the call of activist philosophy to ask how a choreographic practice challenges the presupposition that movement is secondary to form, subjective or objective. The choreographic, as developed here, is a technique that assists us in rethinking how a creative process activates conditions for its emergence as event. Whether and how this emergent event ties into a politics in the making is an open question. But one thing is certain: a politics in the making depends on generating a movement constellation that activates a singular modality of encounter. And each such event involves, in some sense, a choreographic practice.
