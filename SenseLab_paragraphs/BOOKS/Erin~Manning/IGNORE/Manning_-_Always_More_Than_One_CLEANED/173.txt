Waltz with Bashir is about how the virtual plane—what Deleuze (1990) calls the metaphysical surface—of the film brings life back not as a human face, not as a past converted into a present, but as a movement across. By presenting the face in its withdrawing from the imagescape, Waltz with Bashir creates a tight circuit between what presents itself and what remains virtual, returning us to the image’s own movement, to the affective tonality of the imagescape’s haunting amber-black-gray, creating an opening for what Deleuze calls a life, the barely active stirrings of life at the limit. To bring a life to the fore, the human face must remain deterritorialized, collective: when territorialized on a “personal” body of the individual, the face too strongly proposes a territory, an interiority. In Waltz with Bashir, the face that returns, the impassive face of the soldier/filmmaker, is felt as the surface of its own collectively transient becoming. It does not overcome. It is a life, affective resonance in the intensive passage between surfaces of experience. A life, Deleuze reminds us, happens not through transcendence but on the transcendental field itself. “Whenever immanence is attributed to subject and object, which themselves fall outside the plane [of immanence], the subject being taken as universal, and the object as any object whatsoever, we witness a denaturing of the transcendental. . . . And we witness a distortion of immanence, which is now contained in the transcendent” (2007, 389). A life is immanence felt in the stirrings of actualization. Force of potential, force of life.
