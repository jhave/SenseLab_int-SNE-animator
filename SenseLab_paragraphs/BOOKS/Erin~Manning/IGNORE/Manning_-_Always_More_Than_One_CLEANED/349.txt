Since there is no before and after of total movement, the movement’s relational distribution is what is at stake. How the redistributing relation moves between cues affects what will emerge as the resonant territory on the topological surface of the dance dancing itself. Some of the dance’s movement is in and of the human body, certainly, but the force of its redistributive dephasing exceeds the bounds of the human, active in the nonlocal, nonhuman relation priming for collective alignment. In these complex dephasings, what moves the relation is as much the virtual as it is the actual. This is why even as complex an iteration as Synchronous Objects— with its many representations of what One Flat Thing, reproduced can look like—cannot fully map the complexity of choreography as mobile architecture. Representations function at the level of actuality. At their best, they can only peripherally deal with the push-pull of virtual potential that is part and parcel of choreography’s incipient “what else.” The Synchronous Objects Platform attempts to do this by foregrounding in an inventive manner the divergent modalities of Forsythe’s choreographic practice as it reemerges through a variety of synchronous spatial constellations. But no representation can, in the end, adequately attend to the durational force that makes mobile architectures come to expression. This is why it tends to be “The Dance” that stands out most on the Synchronous Objects website. For “The Dance” not only creates a visualization of a form, it makes felt how mobility is architected.
