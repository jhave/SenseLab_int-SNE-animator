The shape of enthusiasm carries with it an intuition. Bergson calls intuition a “direct vision,” a “vision which is scarcely distinguishable from the object seen, a knowledge which is contact and event coincidence” (2007, 20). In the event, in the language we speak, between and in excess of words, there is an intuition of a coming-to-content that is more-than the form of its communicability. This vision, as Bergson might call it, is a direct experience of dynamic form: a swelling, a surging, a bursting, an accelerating, a fading, a fleeting, a moving-with. This dynamic form in the event’s unfolding has “no pre-imposed modality [and is not a] direct cognition” (Stern 2010, 8). It is a direct vision of experience in the making, an intuited immediate feltness of the “how” of experience (Stern 2010, 8).
