Now that there is a sense of how the body evolves as an assemblage in this gardening scenario, consider the role of the object or “matter”—the garden spade, the earth, the tulip bulb—keeping in mind that, like the body, an object is a milieu of relations that are activated through vectors of association in the aliveness of a singular event. And yet, an object is also different from a body in the sense that it attunes toward roles activated by the implicit forces not only in its objectness but of the environment of which it becomes a relational part. An object is as much how it does as what it does. Think this object in relation to this multiplicity, in its competing orders of magnitude, as a speciation that is never disconnected from the event of its coming-to-be (blade-density-resistance, rhythm-handle-forearm).1 Think the object not as this or that preconstructed iteration but as that which calls forth implicit forces that affect not only the objects themselves but the environmentalities of which they are part. And think these implicit forces as the conduit, the vector or force of matter’s inherent capacity to become more-than. Think the object not ontologically but processually. Objects in-forming are exactingly co-imbricated with the implicit forces of their potential to become in an ecology of practices. This is their technicity. Technicity is the modality for creating out of a system of techniques the more-than of system. In the gardening example, technicity is the how of the ecology—the metal push of spade that calls forth the taste of a breeze that is felt as the leaving-behind of the impassability of winter, an ecology that activates, in a kind of future presenting, the coming spring.
