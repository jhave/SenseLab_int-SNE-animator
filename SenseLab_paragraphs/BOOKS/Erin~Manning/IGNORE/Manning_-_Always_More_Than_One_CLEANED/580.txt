In the aligning to the simple togetherness of the everyday, an everyday that moves in certain directions out of necessity and lifelong habits, and in other directions out of curiosity and drift, the tracings surreptitiously go far beyond the paths they trace to make felt the vitality forms of the comings-toact that erupt across the territory’s more stable lines: explosions of congruence, intensive contours. Through the shape of enthusiasm felt in the lines of drift, in the contours that reform the edges of spacetime, an intuition is drawn. This is the intuition of a commoning that is beyond commonality, a commoning of lines of drift meeting, of lines lingering, thickening, curving in a reorienting of spacetimes of experience in the making.11
The tracings begin as a kind of intervention. In 1969 Jacques Lin, a longtime collaborator of Deligny’s in the network, is overtaken by an overwhelming feeling of disempowerment in the face of what he perceives as an uncontainable violence brought on by an autistic tantrum no doubt in large part caused by the potent mixture of a lack of inhibition and oversensory stimulation. He is at a loss and turns to Deligny for assistance. Instead of trying to sort out the experience with language, Deligny suggests that Lin transcribe the autistics’ movements, their displacements in order “to channel language through gesture in the tracing” (Toledo 2007, 798). In time, these tracings become a practice (and a project) across the network: “And so we must trace, not so that there be a trace, to keep something or to locate on the lines of space an experience; we must trace a trace before there is even a trace. . . . We must trace these maps, give being to this drift, to this line that has nothing more than its own path, than the force of being-there without a place of existence” (Han 2006, 187).
