For Ettinger, the Autistwork series marks the drawing of a threshold that accepts, and even rejoices in, a certain not-seeing that follows in all her subsequent work. This not-seeing is a more-than of seeing that allows itself to perceive with the “remembering that I do not remember anymore” that coexists with the “knowing that I do not know” (Ettinger 1993, 62).
