The shape of enthusiasm is emphatically not a quantification of experience. Enthusiasm is not a moral category, not good or evil, just as the morethan is not a quantification of life. Enthusiasm is what moves the field of experience toward the creativity of its continual recomposition. It is the insistent refrain that keeps coming back: “Was that life? Well then! Once more!” (Nietzsche 1967, 318).
