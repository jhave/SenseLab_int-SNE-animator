Already tending toward these kinds of considerations, in 2009 I began to explore, through conductive fabric, proximity sensors, speakers, and miniature fans, how Folds to Infinity might begin to “entertain the environment” beyond the kind of participatory call already sewn into its concept. The idea behind this phase of Folds to Infinity (titled Weather Patterns) was to set up a system of sensors embedded into the fabric that react to movement, altering the threshold conditions of sound in the environment while activating barely perceptible air currents. For this to happen, the participants need not actually touch the work—any shift in the electromagnetic conditions of the room has an effect, as will any movement, including that of air currents. The idea behind this version of Folds to Infinity is to make felt how the simple presence of movement in the space affects the environmental conditions not only of the space itself but also of the work. Because the focus of Weather Patterns is on thresholds of perception, these changes in environmental conditions are not meant to physically alter the space in any radically apparent way. The idea is to enter into relationship with the largely nonsensuous dynamics of a mobile environment, making felt how space is always already in movement. This project, now in its final phase—with collaborators Mazi Javidiami, Nathaniel Stern, Bryan Cera, and Andrew Goodman—seek to entertain the environment with and, in some sense, despite the participant, making the participant part of the active ecology of the world tuning to its difference without necessarily putting the participant in the role of direct activator of change. There of course remains the option to compose with the fabric, to build, to dress, to architect. But the proposition remains more environmental in this piece.
