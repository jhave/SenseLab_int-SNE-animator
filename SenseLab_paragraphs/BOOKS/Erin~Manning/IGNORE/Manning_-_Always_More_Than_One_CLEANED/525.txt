Shape is not the same as form. The magic of the shaping Frugone describes refers to an experience of directly perceiving a proliferation of worlds that are themselves infinitely shaping. They are shaping in the sense that edges are meeting textures, that velocities are meeting intensities, creating ecologies not yet resolved on the strata of objects, subjects, or form. Autistwork n2 paints this process of shaping, inviting the gaze to encounter the exuberant fieldings of what might be called “autistic perception,” making felt that all comings-to-form are first experienced in the vortex of their incipient relational encounterings. It does this by slowing down the process of moving from shaping to form, actively making felt the shaping process. In so doing, it activates the more-than of perception, a morethan that is composed of foldings, of color become movement, of movement become light.
