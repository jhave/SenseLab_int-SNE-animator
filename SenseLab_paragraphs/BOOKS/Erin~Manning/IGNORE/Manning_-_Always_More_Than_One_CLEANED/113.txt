The lure for feeling that activates timeâ€™s differential makes felt the multiplicity of each now. Bodying does not happen once and for all on a linear timeline. There is no question that it resolves as an occasion of experience, and that this resolution has a specific date and time, but as a lure for feeling bodying is less a stable rendering of metric time than a collusion of durations. Because every resolution activates a transduction, new processes are continuously under way. A body is a durational multiplicity, a becoming of continuity, not a continuity of becoming.
