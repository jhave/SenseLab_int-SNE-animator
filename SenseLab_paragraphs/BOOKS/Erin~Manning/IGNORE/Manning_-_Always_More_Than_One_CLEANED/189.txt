This instance of memory’s intrusion into the future-present will continue to resonate at the edges of the film’s metaphysical surface. But, like the dogs of the first amber-gray-black scene, it never returns as such. Never again do we even see its colours—the bright pinks and greens of the clowns and the balloons. Nonetheless, this scene has altered the field, multiplying time’s supposed linearity. “[T]here is no other crime than time itself,” writes Deleuze (1989, 37). The amusement park image marks time/memory as aberrant movement. “What aberrant movement reveals is time as everything, as ‘infinite opening,’ as anteriority over all normal movement” (37). The transcendental field does not transcend time. It fields time’s creation in the event. To transcend time would be to posit linear time in order to redraw time’s passage as an inside and outside of experience that moves seamlessly from past to present to future. This would assume an omnipresent (human) body, documenting, remembering, orchestrating, witnessing. This is transcendence, operative always on the molar stratum of experience where life appears as predefined. The metaphysical surface, on the other hand, has no preconstituted spacetime. It has virtual circuits, impossible flows, ineffable becomings, washouts, active always on the molecular stratum where life is still in the making. Events as they come to expression merge with this metaphysical surface in infinitely dynamic ways. Dynamic events are full of holes, or better, of folds. They propel subjects and objects into the world, but they are not presupposed by them. Actively emergent from the transcendental field of experience, events do not create form once and for all, they create openings for the force of a taking-form. This is memory: the dynamic force of life-living in the uneasy forming.
