Forsythe speaks of seeking physical solutions to dramaturgic propositions. Choreographic objects are designed to provoke movement-events that can be diverted toward a recomposition of habit and, vice versa, compositions of habit that tweak the perceived stable form of objects. This recomposition calls forth a choreography of difference, difference that emerges relationally, activated by propositions embedded into the choreographic objectâ€™s potential deployment. The becoming of continuity.
Choreographic objects act not on individual will: they move the relation.
