What Tustin cannot fathom is that this “how” of experience is itself a form of composing-with. It is an enthusiasm shared not simply with the human interlocutor but with the world itself in the shaping. Enthusiasm in the field of relation, a durational thinking-feeling co-composing with movement worlding. “Intuition, bound up to a duration which is growth, perceives in it an uninterrupted continuity of unforeseeable novelty” (Bergson 1997, 23). “This is the language we speak, / we who can float outside time” (Bergson 1992, 34–35).
