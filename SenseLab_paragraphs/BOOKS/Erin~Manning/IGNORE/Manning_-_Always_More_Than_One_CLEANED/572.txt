Communication is everywhere amplified by the more-than of its apparent content. The shape of words—their affective tonality, the way they taste, what they provoke, how they appear, what lines of drift they trace—is as intensely foregrounded for autistics as the what of language’s content. This is something Tustin cannot understand: autistics “listen to other people’s voices, not as a communication, but as a self-envelopment by lulling shapes,” Tustin writes dismissively (1984, 280). She is clearly missing the point. She cannot fathom that the direct experience of lulling shapes means being capable of seeing the dance of attention of a worlding taking form. Of seeing the shape of enthusiasm. In the communicating—a composingwith.
