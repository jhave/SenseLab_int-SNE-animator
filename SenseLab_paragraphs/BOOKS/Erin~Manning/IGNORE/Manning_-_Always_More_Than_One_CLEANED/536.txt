When experience folds into a synesthesia, when sensation and world are thoroughly intertwined, what is felt is experience infinitely layering: color become sound become resonant trace purpling in the redness of a more-than of seeing. This is how autistics describe their complex perceptual worlds, and this is what occurs, it seems to me, in Ettingerâ€™s Autistwork n2, which reminds us that this is also what painting can do, what can be brought to the world by art. Art can teach us again how to see in the before of form where we might still glimpse the relational force of an eternal object coursing through the actual.
