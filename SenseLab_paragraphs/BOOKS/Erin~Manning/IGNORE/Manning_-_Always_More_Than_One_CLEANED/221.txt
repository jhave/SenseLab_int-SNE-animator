Bashir’s face marks the passage from the abstract plane of experience where memory and war collide without coinciding (the soldier’s face) to the plane of organization where war proliferates as the actual violence of destruction. The soldier and Bashir’s face: an uneasy pairing of bare activity and representation dancing at the limits where the micro and the macro coincide, at the dangerous limit where the micropolitical potentially territorializes into fascisms in the making.26 For “fascism is inseparable from a proliferation of molecular forces in interaction, which skip from point to point. . . . There is fascism when a war machine is installed in each hole, in every niche” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 214).
