What the political can do depends on what the event’s taking-form leaves behind (or casts forth). This more-than touches on the event’s immortality across phases. Every event is held together in the forming by dynamic tendencies. The final taking form of an event occurs when the dynamic form resolves. Here, where the event reaches its subjective form, everything the occasion will come to be is at its apex. But despite this monadic quality, as mentioned earlier, there remains an intensive more-than that continues to feed the process of how the next occasion will come to expression, this in a nonlinear model of spacetime. Here lies the germ of the political.
