How to reconcile the urgency of “everything is alive,” the entranced and unhierarchized commitment to the interweaving of the organic and the inorganic, the fascination with color, sound, texture, the “aroundness” of the world Ralph Savarese notes is ever present in autistic Tito Mukhopadhyay’s writing, how to reconcile these with the medicalized view that, due to autistics’ perceived incapacity to articulate their relation to other humans at the exclusion of the wider ecologies that co-compose the world, they are inherently mindblind and therefore unrelational? How to reconcile the complex dance of attention that is autistic perception with the claim of their inattention to life (understood, of course, as an inattention to the life of the human)?
In the annals of autism pathologization, the diagnosis of mindblindness comes about in a caricatured encounter that goes something like this: An anxious parent takes his child to the doctor. The parent has noticed that the child is not developing according to the norm. The child has either never spoken or has lost what speech was acquired, does not look at or seem to attend to the parent, repeats tasks with a perseveration that seems to border on obsession, demonstrates difficulty with activation and inhibition, and suffers from intense tantrums.2 The doctor takes the situation in hand by attempting to attract the child’s attention in order to see whether the child can indeed communicate. When the child seems to refuse to attend to the doctor—by neither playing with the toys nor looking the doctor in the eye— the child is typically characterized as “unresponsive,” and the parent is sent home with a diagnosis that the child is on the autistic spectrum, a diagnosis too often considered to be the death knell of the potential for a meaningful relationship between parent and child.
