When the event moves out of the theater into the arena of the participatory with the idea of activating collective movement, a choreographic object is often necessary. As described in the interlude “What Else?,” the object here functions not as a thing-in-itself but as a force of form that generates complex patterns in an ecology that touches on the everyday while moving beyond it into the time of the event. With the objectile as the lure, the welling event tunes toward its capacity to generate the conditions for a tweaking of attention that activates the spectator. This poses a choreographic challenge, for these events cannot be choreographed in advance. They rely on a generative choreographing in the doing spurred by an emergent collectivity. In 2004 I began work on a movement experiment/art installation entitled Folds to Infinity, a two-phased fabric-based exploration of how textiles move us (see figure 15). Phase 1, Slow Clothes, is composed of cut and serged fabric based on pattern designs that lend themselves to all kinds of garments when connected to each other. Each piece is singular both in its cut and in the placement of buttons, buttonholes, magnets, hooks and eyes, and can be attached to or paired with any other piece to create garments or environments of the participant’s making.
