Each of these concepts—the diagram, commanding form, mobile architecture, dance of attention—is specific to context. The diagram of a painting feeds on texture, light, and incipient form; the commanding form of a musical piece creates a sonorous refrain across performances and recompositions; a mobile architecture is the activation of the incipient formwithout-form of a choreographic proto-architecture; and the dance of attention is the attentiveness of the milieu itself to the complex landings of experience in the making. Each of these diagrammatic praxes is intensively intertwined, the concepts mobilized in their difference less to mark a general distinction than to orient the practice through which they come to expression.
