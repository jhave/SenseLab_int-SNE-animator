Drop a curve reaches its propositional potential when contrast is activated such that the becoming-body fields the curving of spacetime in a new way, itself co-constituted by this newness. If this happens, what is experienced is the creation of a previously unfelt sensation that now permeates the welling occasion. In the doing, there is a direct experience of the occasion’s transindividuation. This direct experience of the event as transindividuating—as more-than—is more important—and longer lived—than the form the bodying has momentarily taken. This is what makes the movementevent propositional. Form is fugitive. It is the more-than that persists. Drop a curve is propositional not when a body has been defined but when the force of movement-moving activates a field of relation that alters the affective and compositional ecology of the larger event of movement-moving. From technique to technicity.
