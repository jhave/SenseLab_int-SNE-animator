Day 2
Sometimes composing on his iPad, sometimes exploring the field of forces of the rare earth magnets of which the collection and the architecture are composed, sometimes quietly attending to the environment from the halfdistance of his seat on the couch, DJ participated in a dance of attention that was never disinterested. For it was clear, as we communicated through the iPad’s synthesized voice, that DJ did want to actively compose with the installation, and that he felt drawn to it—“I want Erin to help me create play,” he typed. The question was how to bridge that first injunction of tact-touch, how to invite DJ to reach beyond this first injunction toward a new constellation that precisely did not seek to prefigure in advance how the relational field should express itself ? How might we open the work to the differential created in the act of reaching-toward, a reaching-toward through which a relationality could be crafted that would exceed the sum of the event’s parts?
