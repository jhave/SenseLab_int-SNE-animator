Speciations create drifts, and these drifts create runoffs. This is not a metaphor. When autistic perception meets the world, something is doing that fundamentally changes the field of relation. This field of relation “includes” the “we” that is not “I.” It creates a tending-toward, a procedurefor-life that is a shaping of the relational milieu of experience. “Practice does not come after the emplacement of the terms and their relations, but actively participates in the drawing of the lines; it confronts the same dangers and the same variations as the emplacement does” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 203). Lines of drift are lines of life-living. They are emphatically real, if abstract. They shape the trajectories of life-living and of the morethan that animates it.
