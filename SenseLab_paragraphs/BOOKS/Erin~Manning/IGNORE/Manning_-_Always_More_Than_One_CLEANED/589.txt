In ordinary maps, in a cartography of precise Euclidean coordinates, the already-defined masks lines of drift.16 Such maps draw conclusions in advance based on the autocracy of the similar, of the already-seen, of the livedbefore. “No trace of democracy in this enterprise,” writes Deligny about his networking experiment. “At the limit, and in the best moments, [the children’s] mode of listening is imperceptible. To formulate it is to put into danger this imperceptibility” (Deligny 1976, 25).
