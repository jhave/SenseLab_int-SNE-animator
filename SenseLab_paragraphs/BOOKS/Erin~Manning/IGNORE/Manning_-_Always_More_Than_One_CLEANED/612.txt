Speciations are rhythmic activations of a body-morphing that never precede the event of their coming-into-relation. They give rhythm, give tone, to the how of the event’s in-forming, cutting across species fully-formed, connective as they are in the milieu of their relational activation. In the event of Prince and Kanzi, to take these two first as the human and the bonobo would be to engage in the practice of placing the subject outside the event, ignoring the force of speciation. It would be to take the notion of species as given and assume that all encounters are framed by species already fullyformed. This is a brand of identity politics: before we can know how to approach the question “are you a gorilla?” we must know who you really are—a captive gorilla, an autistic woman, a philosopher, an animal activist, a zookeeper, an anthropologist? While all of these criteria make a difference to how the event unfolds—there is no suggestion here that there aren’t asymmetrical power relations5—to posit identity politics as the starting point of the process is to background in advance the activity of the milieu’s rhythmic in-forming and, even more importantly, to undermine the potential of coming, if not to a different answer, at least to a different way of framing the question. For to begin with identity politics is always to assume to know in advance how to frame an answer to a question of belonging, of territory, of identity. To frame the event in advance of its unfolding with markers of identity (“obviously” she is not a gorilla, “clearly” Kanzi is misrecognizing) is to sidestep the act of the event’s unfolding as event: for who can know yet what constitutes gorilla in this context of movement counterpoint?
