A joint project with Norah Zuniga Shaw (of Ohio State University’s Department of Dance) and with Maria Palazzi (of the university’s Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design), Synchronous Objects creates visualizations of a series of screen-based “objects” that actively explore what else One Flat Thing, reproduced could look like. The resulting synchronous objects for the visualization of choreographic data reveal the patterns and complex interlocking systems of action and organization at the heart of Forsythe’s choreographic process. This opens the dance toward a “what else” of the choreographic, targeting a cross-disciplinary audience that departs from the strict arena of dance studies to include mathematicians, architects, cognitive scientists, and philosophers, to name a few. “Our goal in creating these objects,” the team explains, “is to engage a broad public, explore cross-disciplinary research, and spur creative discovery for specialists and non-specialists alike.”
