Like “autistic perception,”2 which, as Donna Williams (1998) suggests, is an experience of encountering the “art of the object” before perceiving the object as such,3 Autistwork n2 makes felt the very ontogenetic force of emergence in its ecological worlding that is perception at its most creative and indeterminate. “Water,” writes Sue Rubin, “in which I find great comfort and joy, is something that falls with an unexplainable grace. For that split second when water falls, I can almost see into an other world” (qtd. in Biklen 2005, 83, 84). Here, where force is still taking form and seeing is still a feeling, anything is possible.
