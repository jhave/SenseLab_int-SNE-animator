“I don’t have many buffers,” writes Amanda Baggs. “To me the world comes in such great detail that it is hard for me to put the easy interpretations on it that most people use; the way they divide it into pieces and make it abstract is foreign to me” (2010b). For autistics all along the spectrum, the world seems to emerge directly in all of its relational complexity with few immediate buffers to compartmentalize it. Added to the constantly agitating relational environment is the fact that sense modalities are overlapping, crossed in ways that make lived experience even more challenging to convey.
To manage the theater of individuation of everyday life with its panoply of sensorial and perceptual emphases, and its unrelenting synesthesia, many autistics speak of needing to redirect experience through a specific sense modality. For Tito Mukhopadhyay, for instance, sound is the modality of choice for the reduction of sensory chaos: “I concentrate on the sound of water falling because I am more sensitive to sounds. . . . I have developed my hearing better than my other senses. I have learned to be comfortable that way because trying to use all my senses turns into a total chaos” (qtd. in Iversen 2006, 69–70).
