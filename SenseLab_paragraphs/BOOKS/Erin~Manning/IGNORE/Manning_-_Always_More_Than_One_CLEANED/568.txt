The core of the problem in Tustin’s analysis of shapes is that she begins with species instead of speciations. To begin with species is to have already put into place a hierarchy of forms. The hierarchy itself then becomes a pathology, an enclosure that wrests from its protected environment all that does not resemble it, separating, as Félix Guattari would say,2 the “normopaths” from the neurotics and psychopaths and, of course, the autistics. For pathologization takes the fully formed individual as the starting point to experience and erects it as a norm. Yet, because there is no such thing as a stable individual—because the individual is always only a temporary vectorization of the larger process of individuation—more and more systems must be put into place to keep up the pretence of the stability of this imposed notion of the norm. These efforts include identifying certain traits within the human species and attempting to link them superficially with every individual in the category (think mindblindness), thus creating a precise assemblage of normative behavior consistently reinforceable.
