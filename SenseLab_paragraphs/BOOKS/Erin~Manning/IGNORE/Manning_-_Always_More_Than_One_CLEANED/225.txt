The Drama of the Political
For eighty-eight of Waltz with Bashirâ€™s ninety minutes the face remains impassive, resists empathy, undoes recognition. Or it looks away. This is the brilliance of the film, that it waits, creating sheet upon sheet of experience, surface upon surface of feeling, contrast after contrast, dephasing after dephasing, amber-gray-black upon amber-gray-black, pushing us across the limits of the sonorous continuum, before it brings us face to face with the documentary footage of the last two minutes. It is this, the intensive passage between abstraction and recognition merging in the recognizable face of horror, that makes the final scene of the film with the flesh-and-blood face of the wailing Palestinian woman so powerful, so terrible.
