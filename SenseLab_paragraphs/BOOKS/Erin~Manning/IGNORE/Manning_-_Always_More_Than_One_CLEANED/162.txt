The virtual share of movement—its technicity, its overarticulation—is not added on to the spiraling body. Technicity is made tangible by the felt experience of duration within the movement itself. When a movement becomes habitual, its durational force is backgrounded to make space for its capitalizable economy in the time of the now. Get to the bus stop, to the coffee shop, to the store. Endpoint is everything. Everyday movements are reduced, compacted, overarticulations muted by overarching directionality and predimensionalizing. A dancing body, on the other hand, learns to stretch out the force of duration, to express incipience, making palpable the force of form that is movement’s procedural intensity. In the dancing, movement actualizes at the very limit of this intensity, making felt the activation of its in-formation as event.
To have moved is to have overarticulated in germ. Dancing is simply one example that brings to the fore the technicity of the body’s overarticulating potential. To dance the virtual is to move while keeping alive the intervals that are the very compositions of an overarticulation that cannot be recognized or reproduced as such but that will feed every subsequent movement. Its mantra is “Already go to what you think is the limit, and then go further.”
