How a movement develops depends on the how of lived folding. Take a line: elbow-shoulder. This line could be drawn as a vector or could be conceived as a curve inflected toward an inclination. Different speeds, different micromovements, different microperceptions. And, of course, different forms. The question is: how to push movement constellations “beyond the turn, to the point where [they go] beyond our own experience” (Deleuze 1988a, 27). When we move beyond our own experience, when we get disoriented in the sound of the in-between, it is the movement that takes over. Here, in the unsustainable arena where micromovements multiply to create microperception, new decisive turns emerge. The decisive turn is not about a personal decision—it is about the beyond of self, “beyond our own experience.” This beyond is not transcendental—it is generated in the event, immanent to it, activated not by a will imposed onto movement from the outside but through the event’s orchestration of a collusion of micromovements toward a singularity that tunes to the more-than of this or that preestablished form.
The conditions have to be right for this to occur. In the elbow-shoulder example, this might occur when the elbow-shoulder line takes on velocity such that a newness of experience activated through the contrast of habit and difference takes hold. When the body is no longer a container for movement but a force for the transduction of movement-moving, we will have gone beyond our own experience.
