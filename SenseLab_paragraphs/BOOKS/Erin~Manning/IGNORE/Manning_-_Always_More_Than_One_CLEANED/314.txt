In the between of eventness there is a strange schism, a disjunction between experience and the consciousness of experience. What we experience as now is already being infested with a new “now,” this new now already slightly altering the experience of the last experience of now. Choreographic objects draw out this paradox of the linearity of measured time versus the duration of experiential time. “The practically cognized present is no knifeedge, but a saddle-back, with a certain breadth of its own on which we sit perched, and from which we look in two directions into time” (James 1890, 609). The time-slip the choreographic object makes felt calls forth the additive and the subtractive aspect of experience such that the time of the event is experienced as more than what was before even as it is less than what it could have been. Future and past entwined in a fabulous experience of the not-quite-now. In this strange time-loop, what is lived is less the encounter with space pre-formed or objects preexistent than a direct experience of relation.
