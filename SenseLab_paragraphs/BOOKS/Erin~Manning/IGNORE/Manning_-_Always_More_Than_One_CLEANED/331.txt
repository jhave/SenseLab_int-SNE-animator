The Synchronous Objects project is replete with what Forsythe calls “choreographic thinking.” Choreographic thinking is the activation, in the moving, of a movement of thought. It expresses itself not in language per se but as the pulses across embodiments and rhythms, the durations and spatializations that create a “contrapuntal composition of complex relationships, patterns, and trends.” This contrapuntal force is active not strictly in the mind or in the body but across a bodying-with that activates spacetimes of composition. “The biggest difficulty . . . is not consciously shaping your body, it is actually letting your body fold . . . to develop a more reactive and many-timed body as opposed to a shaped body.” What stands out in One Flat Thing, reproduced is not the shape of this or that individual body but the velocity with which an emergent field appears in contrapuntal alignment with thought in the doing. Thought in the doing is a movement in the feeling. This is not thought abstracted from movement. It is thought in movement, activated not solely in the body, but across the machinery itself—in the folds of the evolving architecture.
