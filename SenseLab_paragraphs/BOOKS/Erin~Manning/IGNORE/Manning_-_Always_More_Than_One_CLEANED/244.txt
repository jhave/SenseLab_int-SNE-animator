Levinas’s statement turns the stakes of the discussion toward the specific question of the Jew and the Palestinian and the responsibility of Zionism in the face of the Sabra and Shatila massacre. Is it a responsibility for or a responsibility before? And, can there be any question of innocence? Levinas responds: “in alterity we can find an enemy, or at least then we are faced with the problem of knowing who is right and who is wrong, who is just and who is unjust. There are people who are wrong” (Levinas, Finkielkraut, and Malka 1989, 294). From the thinker for whom responsibility is always the question of the response elicited by the face of the other yet who claimed that the face must always remain without content, do we not experience here the stark reterritorialization on the face against which Deleuze and Guattari warn in their work on faciality?33 Isn’t the question of responsibility once again a question of whose face? Is it not the face of the other whom we now see as wrong?
