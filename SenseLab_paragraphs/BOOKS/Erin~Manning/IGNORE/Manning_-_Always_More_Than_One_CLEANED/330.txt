Counterpoint is visualized in two ways on the Synchronous Objects platform. It is explicitly foregrounded in the “object” called “The Dance,” which clearly demarcates the system of cues and alignments in One Flat Thing, reproduced. Here, you find a movement score that demonstrates how the danced movements engage with and respond to one another. Simultaneously, counterpoint is offered up as a transversal mechanism for experiencing the “what else” of this particular dance through the creation of a series of other “objects.” These “synchronous objects” are conceived less as objects than as objectiles: temporary delimitations of activity in germ. They are visualizable opportunities on the platform for fielding the choreographic experience: graphs (Statistical Counterpoint), architectural animations (the Data Fan, the Furniture System), and tools (the Cue Visualizer, the Cue Abstraction Tool). Emphasizing the objects’ generative potential—both for visualizing One Flat Thing, reproduced ’s architecting of potential and for use in the creation of new work, Norah Zuniga Shaw writes: “Because we focused on the dance as a choreographic resource—rather than scoring it for the purposes of preservation—we were empowered to take this rigorous process of data collection into new creative spaces . . . to generate new possibilities for ongoing creativity and research, both in the studio and in the lab.”
