The between of words is what is continuously at stake not only in the language of autism but in all language. For the between emphasizes the inherent collectivity of language, its share in body-worlding. Language is always collective, the between tells us—it activates fields of relation, it patterns for contrast, it connects in the milieu of experience’s unfolding. Language is not separate from the ecologies of practice through which it expresses. All writing, all speaking, is a collective individuation. Dawn Prince (2010) writes: “if a thing existed, it existed as a living part of language and had a deep understanding of its place in the vibrations of speech, in the vibrations of experience.” Language is not an accessory to experience.
