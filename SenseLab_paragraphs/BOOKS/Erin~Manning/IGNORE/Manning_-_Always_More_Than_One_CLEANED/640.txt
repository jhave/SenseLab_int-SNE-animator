The foregrounding of the world in its morphability as experienced in autistic perception opens experience to a level of relation with the world which is rare. This level of relation is an ecological attunement to the multiplicity that is life-living, for it attends, always, to the dynamic details of a process: autistic perception never begins with the general attribute, never assumes integration over complexity. It prehends, always, from the middle, with an active regard for the emergent field’s environmentality. In the register of autistic perception, the world is experienced as an ecology of practices. This results in a mode of existence that moves not from self to self, or self to other, but from dynamic constellation to dynamic constellation. As Mukhopadhyay writes: “Maybe I do not have to try very hard to be the wind or a rain cloud. There is a big sense of extreme connection I feel with a stone or perhaps with a pen on a tabletop or a tree. . . . There is no separation” (Mukhopadhyay and Savarese 2010). Cloud-like. Rock-like.
