Singularities such as emergent selves are co-constituted in a field of experience. They reach-toward in a worlding that becomes them. This worlding is intensified by vitality affects that themselves tune to the world, calling forth landing sites.22 These landing sites are less a specific node of spacetime than the conditions for the propelling of the event’s actualization. In Baggs’s In My Language, we feel the emergent landing sites every time a contour begins to sound, taking-form in the event of its expressibility. A threepart scene makes this felt. The scene begins with Baggs facing the window, her back to us. A tonal sounding accompanies the movement of her hands fluttering at her sides as she rocks back and forth. We are lulled by the movement, which then shifts quite seamlessly to the movement of a metal implement scraping against a surface. This scraping continues to move with the rhythm of the tonal singing, adding to it, but on another plane of experience. Now, we see only the hand, the implement and its shadow on the wall: a tonal rhythm in scraping movement. Then, another shift, this time to fingers moving along a computer keyboard, creating a softer, plushier sound, aligned, still, with the sound of the voice. There is no cut here: the video continues this way. This three-part transition makes felt how the landing occurs. It’s not that these are discrete sites—they are continuities in the sounding through which certain qualities of shift of resonance are foregrounded. Each contour stands out for itself as a remarkable point precisely because of the movement carrying-across. These remarkable points are landings, but landings only in the sense that they activate the force of transition that is the carrying-across.
