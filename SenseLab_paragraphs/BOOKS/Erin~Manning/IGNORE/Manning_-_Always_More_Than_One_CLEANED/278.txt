Movement never stops. Every movement resonates with its preacceleration and its overarticulation, active in a contagion of speeds and slownesses. A “first” movement is not “the beginning.” It is the activation of a differing velocity. Go back to the jump. The question is how to activate the time signature this singular jump requires, poised as it is within a larger field of movement-moving. This activation precedes the actual jumping—it is the event’s preacceleration. Despite the fact that nothing “visible” has happened yet, the jump’s force of form is very much in attendance. This force of form carries in itself not only the force of the preacceleration, but also the movement’s growing into its overarticulation. All of this before you’ve even left the ground.
The actual jump can be thought as the event’s decisive turn. For it is the actual jump that creates the rift in time that marks position, albeit a position that is less a site than the marking of the movement’s continuance, an evolution of site that immanently alters the quality of the taking off. The jump is less a jump-as-such than a dynamic coexperiencing of varying velocities in preacceleration, extension, and overarticulation.
To jump successfully is to jump-through the singularity of this singular interweaving of preacceleration and overarticulation. It is to invite the thinking-feeling Forsythe emphasizes—the thought of the movement endlessly growing after it ends—into the movement even before the displacement through space has taken place. To jump well is to move-through velocities too quick to know, but not too quick to feel. It is to move-with the durational process of the time of movement as felt event. The jump-as-such, however, never represents the totality of our experience. We live the jumpevent. From incipient movement to incipient movement with the experience of velocity in between, the jump cannot be known in metric time, but it can be thought-felt in the verge where time is elastic.
