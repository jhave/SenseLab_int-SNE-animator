Shlomo Malka begins the conversation by quoting a talk of Alain Finkielkraut’s where Finkielkraut says, “We are all split between a feeling of innocence and a feeling of responsibility, both of which are anchored in our traditions and our ordeals. I do not yet know which of the two, innocence or responsibility, we will choose as Jews. But I believe that our decision will determine the meaning that we give to the ordeal of genocide” (Levinas, Finkielkraut, and Malka 1989, 290).
