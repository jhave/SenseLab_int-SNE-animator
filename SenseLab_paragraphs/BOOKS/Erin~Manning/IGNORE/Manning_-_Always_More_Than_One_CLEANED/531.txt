The eternal object is a bit of misnomer—it is neither eternal in the usual sense nor an object. An eternal object is only eternal insofar as it remains a force for composition that creates an infinitely potentializing field of relation across occasions. Think of how redness carries a certain color-light quality beyond this or that actualization, a quality that can be called up as a somewhat stable tendency despite there being millions of individual versions of red: redness evokes a perceptual field that carries beyond this or that event despite the fact that this red will, strictly speaking, never again be the same red. Redness, despite its returning across iterations, is nonetheless not an object. It is a force for the shaping that makes ingress, affecting, luring the actual (the image, the form, the object) toward a vibratory experience of “red” that is both absolutely singular (this quality of light in the coloring) and eternal (generalizable as a shaping that, while it resists form, creates a force of form that exceeds this particular instance of ingression).
