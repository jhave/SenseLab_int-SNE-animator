This event had a lead-up of a year, during which “molecules” were created across the world. Molecules were defined as a group of seven to ten people who would take on a collective project. This collective project was defined as a local event that would creatively address a politico-aesthetic issue felt by local participants to affect the quality of their lives. The politicoaesthetic interventions would last between three hours and seven days and take place during the first week of May 2009.
