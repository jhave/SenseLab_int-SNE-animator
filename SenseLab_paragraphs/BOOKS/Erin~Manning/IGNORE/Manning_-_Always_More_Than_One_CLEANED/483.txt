Composing-with offers a different perspective on language, opening the play of wor(l)ding across registers of perception, sensation, and affect, activating language’s inherent capacity to write-with the edges of pure experience. It also signals to something else. Facilitated communication depends on the presence of the facilitator. The role the facilitator plays is different depending on the individual and can range from their simply being in the room to them holding the end of a pencil while the autistic types to having a hand on his or her elbow or shoulder. As suggested earlier, facilitated communication brings out the relational aspect of language and challenges us to wonder why we tend to consider language—and writing in particular—to be so inherently solitary. This has long been one of the critiques of facilitated communication: that the necessity of the facilitator’s presence suggests that the autistic is in fact incapable of “really” using language— that is, of thinking or writing “independently.” This despite several careful studies of cases where the autistic is tested in the presence of a facilitator who does not actually touch him or her, and despite the fact that there is clearly a genre of writing that can be attributed to autistics that is very much their own—autie-type—not only among communities in the United States and Canada but across the world.
