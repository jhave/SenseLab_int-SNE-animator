What is happening here is complex in ways theories of mindblindness cannot even begin to comprehend. For Baggs, as for all of the autistics I have encountered and about whom I write here, there is no clear separation between the world and the body. World and body are startlingly, painfully, exquisitely, processually one. This is what autism in all of its complexity brings to the project of Always More Than One: it demonstrates that there is a modality of life-living that intimately knows the richness of the more-than, and that this modality dominates in autistics. Not only that: these autistics politicize the role the more-than plays in their experience by insisting that they do not want to be cured of this perceptual gift, no matter how difficult it can make their lives in a so-called neurotypical society. And, with this expression of the necessity for the more-than, they remind us that there are key questions and concerns that need to be addressed about the place of the human in human-centered experience.
