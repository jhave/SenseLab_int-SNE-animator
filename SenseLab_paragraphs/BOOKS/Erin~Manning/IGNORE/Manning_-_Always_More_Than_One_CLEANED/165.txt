The scene returns three times. In hues of amber and gray-black, three animated figures emerge from the sea.1 We see the first figure from behind, a standing naked male body holding a gun, walking out of the water toward an amber-gray shelled-out cityscape. Two more figures lie on their backs in the water. Then the face, a face that will haunt us with its detached familiarity, fills the screen, looking off slightly to the right.
A body framed by water, rippling black-amber, rises, shells brightening the amber-hued night sky (see figure 1). The image pulls back, the cityscape now framed by two feet peeking out of the water. And then we are close once more, facing the rising bodies, accompanying them as they walk out of the sea toward the city.
