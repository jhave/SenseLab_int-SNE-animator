Manning insists on this: we are all on the autistic spectrum, including “neurotypicals” who do not carry the diagnosis. This is not an empty gesture of lazy solidarity. And it is in no way meant to deny the reality of autism or to disregard the very real challenges and often extreme conditions of social, familial, and health care system oppression many diagnosed autistics struggle with. What Manning attempts is to acknowledge the reality and the challenges without surrendering any ground to the pathologization entailed by the conventional category. What if autism were approached not in terms of pathology but from the angle of speciation? That is to say, from the mutually inclusive angle of the more than human in us all, in its continuing variation? From the angle of what cuts eventfully, variably across the barriers? From the angle of the emergent vitality affects, qualities of bursting-with-life-determination associated with different degrees on the spectrum, as well as improvised in encounters-between?
Manning argues that there is a mode of perception that attends to the more-than of experience (as always in process philosophy, it’s all about modal distinction, as mentioned earlier). She describes “autistic perception” as a field perception directly apprehending the complex relational patterning of spacetimes of experience, in their teeming with contingencies, and in all their uniqueness: a direct perception of the transcendental field of becoming. The countervailing mode of perception “chunks” experience. It immediately divides it into subjectand object-oriented affordances readymade for the traditional either/or logic and its categorical judgments, primarily in this case of usefulness (form-and-function redux, ready for stenciling duty).
