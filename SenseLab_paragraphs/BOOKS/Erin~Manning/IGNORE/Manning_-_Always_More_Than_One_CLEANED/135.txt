Affect is what returns. Affect returns as the force of becoming that incessantly creates collectivities in the making, collectivities tuning toward an outside where the mutations of difference are most forcefully creative. For affect is never exhausted: it modulates across metastable fields of experience in the making, amplifying matter in its in-forming, incorporeal potential.
