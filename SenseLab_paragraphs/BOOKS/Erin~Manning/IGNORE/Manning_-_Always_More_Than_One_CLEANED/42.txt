Manningâ€™s word for the variation across iterations of singular events generically belonging to the same populating series is speciation. It is as crucial for an understanding of Always More Than One to avoid stenciling species back into a categorical concept as it is to avoid committing this transcendental error with regard to affect. A species is not a set of beings having certain properties generally defining them as members of the same class. A species for Manning, as her term (speciation) implies, is a species of event. A speciation occurs when two or more constituted individuals come back together singular-generically in a way that produces a new vitality affect. The defining trait of the speciation is the uniqueness of the vitality affect arising from the burst of determination of such a coming-together. This is not a property of either of the individuals coming together. It comes between them. It is in the event of their coming-together, at the crossroads where a line of continual variation meets the unforeseeable variable of a what-else. In the thousand-sittings-in-chairs, backside and cushion speciate. In the thousand-suckings-of-a-finger, mouth and finger speciate. The species, in each case, is the vitality affect (comforting). The speciation is the difference each one of the thousands brings to the vitality affect.
