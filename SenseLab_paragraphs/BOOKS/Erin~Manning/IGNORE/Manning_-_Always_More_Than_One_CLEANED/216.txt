The waltz: Two men crouched on the edge of a road in a gray, shelled cityscape fight over a gun in the midst of heavy artillery. Imminent danger all around: soldiers shoot wildly, their anguish palpable. The sky is amber against the gray of the buildings and the dusty asphalt. We see fire in the distance. The soldier rises, the gun he has now managed to get a hold of at his side. We watch, tense, as the soldier moves into the suicidal path of bombs and bullets. The sound of a Chopin waltz playing in the background intensifies. The soldier begins to cross the street to the rhythm of the music in a three-step all the while firing the gun into the air. Five seconds, ten seconds, the image focused on his feet, one-two-three, one-two-three, the bullet casings falling around him as he continues to shoot into the sky. We hear a gunshot whizzing by but the soldier’s seemingly invincible body is the only one the image cares about, the imagescape dancing with him amid the gun-flame amber in the gray-light surround. As the waltz gains in speed, the casings continue to pollute the earth around him and the image turns and turns, waltzing with the soldier as the sky darkens, its amber shadows intensifying in step with the image’s focus in on the soldier’s tight circle, one-two-three, one-two-three. Twenty seconds.
