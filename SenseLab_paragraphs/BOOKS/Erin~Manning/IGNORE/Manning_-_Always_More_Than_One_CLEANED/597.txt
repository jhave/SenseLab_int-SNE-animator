Our home beyond nowhere is “the language we speak.” Now-here is the milieu, the never known in advance. Here, speciations abound, forever getting overcoded by species, by the imposition of the no-time of pathologization, by the segmentarity of rigid lines that mark off a territory, creating an inside and an outside. This will always happen. And yet speciations will also infinitely reemerge. They are unstoppable. The technical question is how to draw out the durational intensity of the drift, how to forestall the lingering in experience that autistics describe so beautifully. The language of the drift, of shapes, is pathologized because the lingering seems hedonistic, because there are things to do, places to be. What happens when the tables are turned? What happens when we begin to realize that these places to be are themselves composed of infinite lines of drift, creating runoffs, orienting anew, again? Lines of drift are everywhere active. You can’t start from the macro and build down but nor can you assume that all change happens in the micro. The movement is across. You can never fully count on the edifice you’ve built to protect you from the orientings-in-place of pure experience. The drift is ultimately unavoidable. Between the words.
