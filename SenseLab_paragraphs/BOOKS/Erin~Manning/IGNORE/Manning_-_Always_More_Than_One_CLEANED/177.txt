A transcendental field can never be known as such. But it can be felt through the singular series—the lives—that bring it momentarily into appearance: “Singularities are the real transcendent events, and Ferlinghetti calls them ‘the fourth person singular.’ . . . Only when the world, teaming with anonymous and nomadic, impersonal and preindividual singularities, opens up, do we tread at last on the field of the transcendental” (Deleuze 1990, 103).
