Counterpoint’s intermittent and irregular coincidence of attributes agitate the field of action at the level of speciations. In the case of Prince and Kanzi, it is not two fully constituted body-envelopes that dance but a multiplicity of body-tendings moving in their difference. Speciations in the moving: finger-ground-spine, extension-rotation-bend, metal-fur-breath. What agitates is a body-likeness, a field of relations that does not mimic a body, but creates a bodying in a shifting co-composition of experiential spacetimes. Von Uexküll speaks of spiders that are fly-like, of cups that are coffee-like. These are speciations—compositional tendencies active in the relational field their coming-into-eventness calls forth: “To be fly-like means that the spider has taken up certain elements of the fly in its constitution. . . . Better expressed, the fly-likeness of the spider means that it has taken up certain motifs of the fly melody in its bodily composition. Everywhere it is the counterpoint which expresses itself as a motif in such configurations” (Von Uexküll 2010, 190–91). The dancer’s movement was perhaps spiral-like, wall-like, sound-like, connecting not directly to another body, but to a sounding, a spiraling, a levitating gravitational field. Heavyto-the-ground meets laughter-in-movement: gorilla-like.
