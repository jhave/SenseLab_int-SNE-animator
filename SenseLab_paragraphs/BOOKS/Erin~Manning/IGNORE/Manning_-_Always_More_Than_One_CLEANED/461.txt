What those who uphold this approach refuse to understand is that in the theater of individuation that is the autistic spectrum, communication does not unfold in ways that make general categorizations about perception possible. Views such as those of Baron-Cohen are based on a kind of scenario that tends to focus solely on human-human interaction, emphasizing those limits of perception that can easily be mapped, such as the direct communication through language between two humans or the ability, in language, to articulate the limits of a relationship. As Daina Krumins and many others have made clear, however, the autistic dwells in an ecology of practices that creates resonances across scales and registers of life, both organic and inorganic, not solely in the so-called human realm. “Everything [is] somewhat alive,” Daina Krumins writes, “I attend to everything the same way with no discrimination, so that the caw of the crow in the tree is as clear and important as the voice of the person I’m walking with” (qtd. in Miller 2003, 86–87).
