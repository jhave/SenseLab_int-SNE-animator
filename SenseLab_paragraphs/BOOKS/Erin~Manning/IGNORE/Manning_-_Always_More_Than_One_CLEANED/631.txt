Mentality—“a factor of intensity in experience”—moves the event beyond its physical pole (Whitehead 1978, 101). “When the species refuses adventure, there is relapse into the well-attested habit of mere life. . . . Varied freshness has been lost, and the species lives upon the blind appetitions of old usages” (Whitehead 1929, 19). If the physical pole were all that were at stake, and if life were merely about a passive overcoming in the interests of self-preservation, there would be no creativity, and certainly no reinvention of life. Again, it is necessary to move beyond the thought of this or that human or animal life: life here touches on all that has the capacity for transition. It is life-living, a life: speciation in exquisite more than human configurations.
