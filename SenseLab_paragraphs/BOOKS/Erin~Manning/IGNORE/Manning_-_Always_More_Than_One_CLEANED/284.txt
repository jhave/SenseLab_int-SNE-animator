An incipient tendency toward taking a step is felt as a walking when the divergent metastabilities congeal into a singularity such that the step takes the decisive turn toward the movement-moving of a walking. The flow of the walk now feels less like a stepping than a moving horizontality despite the fact that, like the steps themselves, the horizontalizing remains composed of an infinity of microtendencies toward verticality, the most obvious being the verticality of the body itself in relation to the horizontal ground across which it moves.
