Ethics are unsayable, and yet they can be felt in the relational matrices language calls forth, in the rhythms, tonalities, silences, velocities of language in the making. Here, the ineffable briefly comes to life, not to my life but to a life, acting with the force of life across the more-than of wor(l)ding. This more-than soars between the words. It writes-with, active in an incipient choreography of expression that dances attention.
Composing-with is the bringing into act of the relation between affective tonality and affective attunement in a collectivity expressive of an acrossness of wor(l)dings that captivates, that unmoors, that tunes toward radical difference. Its ethics are its unspoken call, agitating in the interstices of its commanding form, a call heard, always, in the register of the more-than that is individuationâ€™s dance.
