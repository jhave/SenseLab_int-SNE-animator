As an audience, the same shift to the beyond of experience can be felt. When the piece is truly propositional, when it activates a mobile architecture that is inherently diagrammatic in its force, we experience movement’s contrast more than its taking-form. We feel the resonance of the microexpressions of movement in the creation of difference. This experience of contrast is felt through the perception of how the echo of a remainder that is the incipience of the movement passes into the singularity of the next event. At dancing’s best, this verging on the new is felt intensively, transforming a series of steps into an ecology of experience. If captivated by the resonance machine, we become participants in event-time.
