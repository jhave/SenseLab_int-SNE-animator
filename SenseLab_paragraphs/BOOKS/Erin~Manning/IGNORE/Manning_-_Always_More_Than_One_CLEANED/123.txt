Affect, understood along the lines of Whitehead’s concept of feeling, is a transductive force that propels being to become across the phases of its individuation. Affect is of the milieu: it resituates the body as force of form within what Isabelle Stengers (2010) calls an “ecology of practices.” Affect activates the very connectibility of experience. It is the force, the lure, through which a certain constellation comes to expression.
Take the example of a snake in the context of a phobia. Wandering through the desert, everything is felt as the force of snakeness. There is no rustling that does not elicit fear. But this is fear even before it can be defined. It is in the edginess of pace, the tenseness of posture. It alters how each step is taken. Every quick movement—lizard, wind, fly—activates a certain bodying that attends, intensively, to an environment in the making. A body is in-forming, a bodying more fear than form, taut with a foreboding as yet undefined yet all-consuming. Since bodying cannot be thought without milieu, it is not simply the body that is tense but the field of the event itself that is poised. An emergent ecology is forming—one of jitteriness, of hyperattention, of sensory acuity. An intensive feltness of the jarring contrasts of the desert is perhaps how this ecology expresses itself perceptually, coupled with the hyperattentive peripheral vision that sounds each micromovement. A slight shift can make all the affective difference, however. A move toward the water that flows at the bottom of the desert canyon— where snakes don’t wander—immediately retunes the body-event. A different ecology soon emerges. This ecology is marked by a new field of affect.
