From the perspective of her long-standing clinical research into autism, Francis Tustin writes of her many encounters with “autistic shapes,” which she describes as the non-object–oriented realm of preconscious experience where autistics linger. She does this critically, arguing that this process of shaping is something to be avoided. Rather than seeing the fascinating concept of prelinguistic shapes as an inroad into understanding the complexity of experience, autistic or otherwise, Tustin prefers to confine the concept of shapes to the realm of the pathological, making it the goal of the psychoanalytic process she condones to divest autistics of their shapes. In so doing, she believes they will become more accountable to the objects in their midst.
Tustin writes: “In the days when I was working as a psychoanalyst child therapist with young autistic children, as they began to talk, they would tell me about their ‘shapes.’ . . . They were not the shapes of any particular object. Just ‘shapes.’ . . . I do not know what other forms were covered by what they referred to as ‘shapes’ . . . it was not the shape of a specific object which existed in actuality; it was just a ‘shape’ ” (1984, 278).
