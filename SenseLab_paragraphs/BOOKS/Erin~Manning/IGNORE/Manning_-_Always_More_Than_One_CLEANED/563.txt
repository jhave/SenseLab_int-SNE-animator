That Tustin cannot quite articulate the nature of a “shape” is not surprising: the shaping of experience in the making is dynamic and amodal— active in the perceptual field where language is not-yet. It is, as described in chapter 1, a vitality form, a preconscious verging toward a coming-to-act that tunes to the relational milieu of experience. Such a vitality form occurs in the half-second or less of an event’s coming to expression. It is, as Stern underlines, a “manifestation of being alive” that is all about movement— vitality forms shape the lived experience of duration, giving incipient experience its activation contour.
