The transindividual in the writing that is beyond being activates wonder. Wonder: when language begins to move with the ripples of what can only be felt in the saying. The language of Tito Mukhopadhyay, of DJ Savarese and Amanda Baggs, of Larry Bissonnette and Sue Rubin, of Dawn Prince and so many others activates the wonder that is the thinking-with of the co-composed more-than. It worlds in an ecology that is co-constitutive of its expressibility. It generates registers of experience. It activates realms of emergence and relation even as it brings them to the edge of intelligibility. This language of wonder is with, not about. It exists across, in the thinkingfeeling. And it worlds, refusing to categorically distinguish between forms and forces. Instead, it caresses, it captures, it distorts, to create expressibilities anew. Human, object, environment, tone, color, sound, what makes its way into communication is not first and foremost the monadic nature of forms but the transversal forces of the as-yet-unthought in the thinking.
