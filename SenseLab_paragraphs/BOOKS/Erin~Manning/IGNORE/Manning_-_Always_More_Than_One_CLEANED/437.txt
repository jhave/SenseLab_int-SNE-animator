Every aspect of Arakawa and Gins’s philosophy is already here, in the first step. This first step, its urgency, its insistence on the more than human (the organism that persons), its procedurality, its emphasis on the associated milieu (the bioscleave), its underscoring of transformation, and its belief in the transductive force of dephasing as the modality of invention, make apparent the fact that architecting mobility—creating a mobile architecture that dances you—depends on an eternal return into the dephasing potentiality of the initial step.
