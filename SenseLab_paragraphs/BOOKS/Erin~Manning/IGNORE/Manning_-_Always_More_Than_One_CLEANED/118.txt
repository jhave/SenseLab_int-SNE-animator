What will have been felt as this singular event of color-light-feeling will now forever exist in the perceptual field it has cogenerated. And yet this quality of yellowness, say, will, in its perishing onto the nexus of experience, already and immediately have co-composed with all previous and subsequent feelings of luminosity. There will never be an experience of luminosity—or any experience of light, of color, of joy, of warmth, or of the terrible unease of another day lost to depression despite the season’s shift— that will not have the capacity to connect to the feeling generated by this event. In its reemergence in a next event, however, the yellowness may feed a completely different process, even to the extent that the subjective form of the occasion in question may be far removed from the earlier experience of luminosity as a joyful tending to yellow. To call this yellowness a “thing” would be to underestimate the complexity of its ecology and the field of feeling it calls forth both in the present and in its futurity. The luminosity is less object than field of relation. It is less color as such than compositional force.
