Letâ€™s return to the first scene of the film. The only dream in the film, this first scene is strangely disconnected from every other event, and yet its surface quality imbues all future imagescapes. This scene creates the mood of the film, its contrast, color, and affective tone. For two minutes we move to the threatening rhythm of twenty-six dogs, their growls and panting in tandem with the synthesized sound of drums mixed with aggressive barking, the image finally centering on an amber sky, a gray building, a lone, distant face at a window looking out onto the street. Moving alongside the dogs, our gait is one of horizontality, a threatening movement across, relentless, from now to now to now. Never is there a clear sense of the status of this now. The now is always moving. The movement is before, behind, and across, and we move with it, horizontalizing the topological surface of pure experience. The dogs surround us on this horizontalizing plane even as we move with them, following them in their fight to the death. In this terrifying moving surround, we see amber eyes as placeholders of certain versions of events; we experience the mobilization of discrete singularities, and yet nothing stays still as we at once participate in and fear the mobile surface, the abstract surface of the amber-gray-black that continuously moves across (see figure 4).
