Movement expressibility calls forth a dance of attention that moves in open circuits, looping across nonlocal tendencies, feeding-forward into the multiphasing surfaces  of  movement  aligning.  Dancing  attention  is dancing-with the environment cueing. It is less being attentive-to than becoming in attention-with: the dance of attention is alive with the tendencies of a mobility that can only express itself through the future-forming interval of event-time.
