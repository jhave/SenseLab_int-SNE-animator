Between the scenes, in the stark contrast of nows, Waltz with Bashir introduces a serial interlude: a music video. In each case, music overlays the scene, a scene imbued with paradoxes of and in time. The first of these “music videos” takes place on the “love boat”: “Then the war started and they put us on that damned ‘loveboat,’” Carmi recalls. oMD play and we are transported into the ’80s with the reminiscent tune of “Enola Gay.”23 We watch as men dance on the boat, drinking. The scene happens in a beyond of description, images unfolding without explanation for forty-five seconds. Forty-five seconds to pan in from a remote distance to a close-up of the partying on the boat. Forty-five seconds until the love boat explodes and the water turns from black to red. Forty-five seconds until Carmi speaks again: “I saw my best friends go up in flames before my eyes.” But even as we hear the voice and we see the red water, even as we attempt to situate ourselves in the between of the living room in Holland where the discussion takes place and the capsizing boat, what we actually feel is not the explosion. We feel a strange sonorous blue quiet: we watch Carmi being taken away from the scene onto the body of an immense blue water-woman, we watch as they drift together away from the love boat, their coupled bodies as blue as the blue water, the blue sky, the blue boat. And it is from this vantage point, from Carmi’s perspective, lying on the woman’s larger-than-life swimming body, that we see the exploding boat at last, that we see war planes drop bombs, as though for the second time. And it is through his eyes (his head turned away from us) that we watch what at first we only heard, the scene turning blood-orange, bodies, boat, ocean colored by the event. With the world once more turned amber, we watch with him, his face resting on her stomach in the ocean, looking into the distance, impassive.
