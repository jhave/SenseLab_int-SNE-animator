As the soldier’s dance comes to an end, the image is taken over by the larger-than-life poster of Bashir’s face, gazing offscreen, pockmarked with bullet holes. We sense a shift: from the micropolitics of the waltz to the macropolitics of everything Bashir represents as the recently elected president, as the murdered Phalangist leader, as the dark precursor to a war already in the making. Bashir’s face, larger than life, takes over the screen until we are looking straight at him, another face that eludes us, that will not look at us. But this is less an impassive face than a face uninterested in us: Bashir’s gaze is turned away, turned to the prelude, perhaps, of the Sabra and Shatila massacre, a massacre we will not fully see, directly connect to, or ever fully comprehend. Sixteen seconds with Bashir’s face looking away, a nonmerging with its extensive surface, the macropolitical surface of the Lebanon war.
