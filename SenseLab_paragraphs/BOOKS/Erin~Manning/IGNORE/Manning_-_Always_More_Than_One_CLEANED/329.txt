Forsythe describes One Flat Thing, reproduced as a “baroque machinery,” defining the baroque as “the apogee of counterpoint.” For Forsythe, counterpoint refers to “a field of action in which the intermittent and irregular coincidence of attributes between organizational elements produces an ordered interplay.” Counterpoint is not a mimicry of positions. It is a folding-through of points of inflection. These points of inflection are less positions than swerves in the movement. Counterpoint catches these tendencies in the making and folds through them, fashioning the beginnings of a distributed relational field. This field in turn folds through coming counterpoints, the dance increasingly dancing itself. This, in Forsythe’s terms, is a baroque machinery, a machine for creating intensive folds of movement  continuously  moving-through  but  ultimately  escaping  position. Deleuze writes: “The Baroque refers not to an essence but rather to an operative function, to a trait [trait]. It is always making folds. It does not invent the fold: there are folds from the East, Greek folds, Roman, Romanesque, Gothic, Classical. . . . Yet the Baroque twists and turns its folds, pushing them to infinity, fold over fold, fold after fold. The Baroque trait is the fold that goes to infinity” (1993, 3; translation modified). One Flat Thing, reproduced is baroque in its emphasis on counterpoint’s capacity to create tendencies for aligning and cueing that create folds, not just bodies folding but spacetime folding.
