Choreography’s ecology is rhythmic. It is composed of an infinity of varying velocities, vibrations, sensations. These individuating tendings of movement in the moving activate environmentalities that in turn inflect how bodies move with and through the world. The time of rhythm or movement’s time signature is therefore always more-than (more-than actual, more-than human). Rhythm is how the future of movement-moving makes itself felt. Rhythm is how we know duration, a duration that is always more than one: “In reality there is no one rhythm of duration; it is possible to imagine many different rhythms which, slower or faster, measure the degree of tension or relaxation of different kinds of consciousness, and thereby fix their respective places in the scale of being. To conceive of durations of different tensions is perhaps both difficult and strange to our mind, because we have acquired the useful habit of substituting for the true duration, lived by consciousness, an homogeneous and independent time” (Bergson 1911, 275).
