This is relevant to the story Prince recounts for two reasons. First, as I mention above, the framing of the event is built on a notion of regard that foregrounds less an interpersonal stance than an affective tonality. Second, in the event of the regard there is a slippage in time that undermines a static positioning of subject and object. Whitehead’s notion of concern gives us the tools to understand this crafting of time in the relation. Prince writes: “To them, I had never been away, because I had really been there once.” In the event of relation, a concern is emergent that alters the conditions for a regard that “will always have been there once.” Recipient and provoker are not to be confused simply with “Dawn Prince” and “the gorillas” or “Prince” and “Kanzi.” Recipient and provoker are the myriad affective tonalities of an encounter that stages time and event such that “to have really been there once” is to have set into motion the conditions for an activation of regard— of concern—that is capable of outliving the immediate occasion.
