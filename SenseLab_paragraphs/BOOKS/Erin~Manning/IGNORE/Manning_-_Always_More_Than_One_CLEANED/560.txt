An enthusiasm with life in the making is a shaping of the resonant field of experience in the withness of expressibility’s taking form. This shaping is not a closed shape, does not take after an object or come from a subject. It is not the human as preconstituted who is enthusiastic. Enthusiasm is the name I am giving to the tremulous field of expression itself, to its exuberance, especially when this field percolates at the very limits of expressibility in the before of the subject or object, in the before of image or form. Enthusiasm as a movement-with that colors expressibility, giving a certain allure to the coming-to-expression. “I” is not enthusiastic—the shape of worlding is enthusiastic, in-forming toward an act without predecessor, an act always yet in the trembling “where memory echoes from the future.”
