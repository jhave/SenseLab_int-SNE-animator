Experimentation calls forth the time of the event. The participants move because they are moved to do so, their attention aroused, their awareness tweaked, their engagement with the spacetime of the event already altering the atmosphere of the space. White Bouncy Castle is more than a large platform for jumping: it effects a microperceptible change in the feeling of time, shifting the everydayness of time toward the durational time of play. Choreographic objects provoke this time-slip in large part because they bring to the fore the role objects play in everyday experience. Everyday objects resonate with pastness. They exist in an ecology of experience from which they cannot be abstracted. Encountering a familiar object stimulates this experience of pastness even as it activates, in play, a refielding of ecologies at once familiar and disjointed.
When we directly perceive the past in the present of an occasion’s unfolding, Whitehead calls it nonsensuous perception. By nonsensuous perception, Whitehead is referring to the complex rhythm of memory—a time-slip of experience that fields our current perceptions. In the fielding of experience, Whitehead suggests, we perceive not first and foremost from sense to sense but from relation to relation. “The present moment is constituted by the influx of the other into that self-identity which is the continued life of the immediate past within the immediacy of the present” (1933, 181). It is not the past as such or the object as such we perceive in the then-now. It is the activity of relation between different thresholds of spacetime. It is the object from the past in the configuration of the present. The then-with.
