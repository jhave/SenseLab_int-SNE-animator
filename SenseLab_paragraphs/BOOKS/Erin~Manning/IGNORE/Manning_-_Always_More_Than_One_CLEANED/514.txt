A transversal, ontogenetic concept of the ethical can never begin with the human or with the body as such. To situate the ethical on the macropolitical scale of human interactivity is to underestimate the hold preconceptions have on our engagement with difference. It is to put too much faith in a politics of representation where the force of a life—the protopolitical bare activity of collective individuation—has been backgrounded by the systems that place the human above all else.
