The associated milieu of technicity is never given in advance, never conditioned before a process is under way. It is the event’s process, never its mediation. Technicity is the field of incorporation in the making of technique’s insistent difference and repetition. “The taking-form does not accomplish itself visibly in a single instant, but in a number of successive operations. We cannot strictly distinguish the taking-form from the qualitative transformation” (Simondon 2005, 57). Technicity sets the conditions for successive operations, each of which incorporates the implicit, creating an opening toward an ecology of experimentation. It multiplies the form that “is but a fabricated intention, with a flighty disposition, [that] can neither grow old or become” toward an intensity that will always resist capture, but that will nonetheless leave its trace. Technicity is an open field for structured improvisation. It in-forms a process of taking-form, gathering from that process the myriad levels of information. In doing so, it reminds us that form is in-formation, at once a complex tending-toward that momentarily resolves as this or that, and the incipient nextness of a futurepastness.
