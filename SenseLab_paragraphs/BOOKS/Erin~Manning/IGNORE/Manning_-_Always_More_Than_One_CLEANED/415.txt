Remembering the Future
Cues play with memory, yet their modality is not remembering. A dancer’s response based on remembering would be far too slow, especially in the case of the rapid flow of Forsythe’s singular movement exploration. The cue mobilizes not memory as preexistent but memory as crafted in movement. Memory is the force of attention mobilized in an emergent spacetime. Memory not simply in and of the body, but with the bodying-in-movement of space-timing.
