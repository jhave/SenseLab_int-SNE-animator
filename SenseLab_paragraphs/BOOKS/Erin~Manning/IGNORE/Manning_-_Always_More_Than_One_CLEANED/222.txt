Waltz with Bashir gives life to the bare activity of the political bubbling to the surface of the transcendental field at the same time that it warns that surfaces are not purveyors of moral truths. In the immensity of Bashir’s face filling the screen and dwarfing the soldier, we sense that protopolitics are always potentially fascist politics, and yet we also feel the uncanny surplus of the waltz’s movement undermining the straightforward narrative of political predetermination. From the waltz to Bashir, from the soldier’s face lost in the reverie of his mad movement to the calm certainty of Bashir’s distant gaze, a political drama is set forth that creates a tight circuit of molecular potentials and micropolitical captures.
