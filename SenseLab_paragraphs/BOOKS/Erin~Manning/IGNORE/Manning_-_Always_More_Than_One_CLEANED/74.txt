In much of the literature, autism is associated with a developmental incapacity to create meaningful (empathetic) relations. In My Language counters this claim with a strong political statement. Too often, Baggs says, personhood is directly associated to verbal interaction, which is then posited as relationality. Proposing a different model entirely, backed by an ethics of difference, Baggs’s video forecasts a milieu of the most intense relationality, one of sound and light, smell and touch, active not simply for the human but in a withness of body-worlding that challenges the very notion that the human is at the center of (relational) experience. Baggs moves through the environment and it moves through her, feeling-with its forms and forces, expressing it as it expresses her. With and without language, Baggs is at pains to demonstrate that relation is the how of the world’s co-emergence. There is nothing but relation. It is precisely this intensive relationality, the video suggests, that often makes it difficult for autistics to interact with others. For autistics do not as easily subtract containment from the experience of relation. They do not tend to first and foremost abstract themselves—their “self ”—from the emergent environment. This is precisely a neurotypical tendency, as proponents of neurodiversity would say.
