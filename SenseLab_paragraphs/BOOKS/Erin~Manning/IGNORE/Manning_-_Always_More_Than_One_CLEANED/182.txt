And, to the physics of surfaces a metaphysical surface necessarily corresponds. Metaphysical surface (transcendental field ) is the name that  will be given to the frontier established, on the one hand, between bodies taken together as a whole and inside the limits which envelop them. And on the other, propositions in general. This frontier implies, as we shall  see, certain properties of sound in relation to the surface, making possible thereby a distinct distribution of language and bodies, or of the corporeal depth and the sonorous continuum. In all these respects, the surface is the transcendental field itself, and the locus of sense and expression. (Deleuze 1990, 125)
