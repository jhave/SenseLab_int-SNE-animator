Enthusiasm touches on a future-pastness in a topology of time that does not sequester the beginning from the end, that captures the saying in its middling. In the middling, bodies are not yet constituted: eventually they will resolve, taking the form of a thousand different species, with a thousand different agencies. But let’s not move too quickly toward a body reborn, for this is not where enthusiasm resonates. Let’s stay instead in the between, in the force of form that shapes experience. For, when we learn to dwell in the shaping of enthusiasm that is the middling of experience, we discover many things, not least of which is that the difference between autispeak and anyspeak is not as fundamental as we may have believed, despite what Francis Tustin says.
