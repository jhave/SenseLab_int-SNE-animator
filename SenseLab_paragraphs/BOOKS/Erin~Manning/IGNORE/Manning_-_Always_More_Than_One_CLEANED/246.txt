To create more life is to produce difference. It is to resituate memory in the act of the telling that opens life-living to the pure experience of the welling now. “Recollection introduces difference into the  present  in  the sense that recollection constitutes, each subsequent  moment,  something new” (Deleuze 2004, 45; translation modified). The drama of politics at the heart of Waltz with Bashir is the recursive now, the terrible now of the tense, war-infested street where the soldier erupts from his war-self into a dance, the eerie now of the love boat’s dance exploding into blood-red ocean, the strangely quiescent now of Bach dancing in the forest. This drama of time, in time, is not theatrical. Waltz with Bashir does not represent war or memory or suffering. It does not express it on a stage that is separate from its happening. It lives it, on the very edge of life where life takes on the resonant political drama of a life.
