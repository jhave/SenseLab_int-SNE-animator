Autistic perception never begins with an object. Similarly, the “imageobject” of Autistwork n2 is not what we see. What appears is not strictly a photograph taken in a time of war, trauma, or diaspora, though this of course leaves its memory-shadow. What we see is how we see: the withness of perception folding. We see the experience of feeling the fold. We see the quality of the abyss of perception’s virtual infinity, we see the unseeable (the unbearable). Or better: we feel it in the amodal more-than of vision. We see-feel the vibratory force of purple edging to red, of parchment texturally haunted. We see-feel an edging into tendency, a durational velocity folding toward a more-than that continuously redraws the relation between seeing and feeling, between image and fold, between reddening and redness.
