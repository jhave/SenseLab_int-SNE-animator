Giving this activity of shaping the name of enthusiasm, making enthusiasm the force of the not-yet, emphasizes the towardness, the exuberance and the intensity of vitality forms, calling forth the way in which they manifest always in excess of actual forms in the towardness of a comingto-be. Vitality forms take the shape of the not-yet such that they in-form not simply the content of the experience but its affective tonality: “they are the felt experience of force—in movement—with a temporal contour, and a sense of aliveness, of going somewhere” (Stern 2010, 8). They are the “‘shapes’ of sound, smell, taste and sight” that are “‘felt’ rather than heard, smelled, tasted or seen” (Tustin 1984, 279).
