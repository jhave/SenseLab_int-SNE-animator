The infant is not a passive slate (or a proto-container) into or onto which the world can be written. The infant is itself an emergent experience (an experiment in emergence), an individuation of interweaving strata active in the creation of ontogenetic worldings. These worldings are affective. They meet the infant halfway, transforming, at each level of the coconstitutive strata of experience, being and worlding as they come together. This coming-together is not based on cognitive confirmation. It is preconscious, situated in a pure experience of proto-awareness. It is an immanent becoming-present of experience in experience, the feeling of a “déjà-vu” in a nowness without, as yet, a past or a future. In preconscious pure experience of ontogenetic worlding, we have not yet succumbed to the promise of linear time, living instead in the active topology of spacetimes of experience that many adults spend their lifetimes resisting. At the heart of these experiential topologies is vitality affect.
Affect can be thought of as supra-modal. It operates across registers: “an affect experience is not bound to any one modality of perception” (Stern 1985, 53).
