Pure process is outside experience. For experience to be lived, it is necessary for there to be a cut or a decisive turn that brings contrast to duration. Yet, thanks to the force of form the interval activates, each form-taking is infected by the processual force of the more-than. There can be no becoming of continuity without this more-than.
The challenge is to at once acknowledge the atomicity of the event and concede that there is a force of form that accompanies the expression of a process’s culmination. The event’s time signature is allied to this force of form, and yet it also exceeds it, for time, as Forsythe emphasizes, is unsustainable. Think the force of time as rhythm. Rhythm is always more-than. It is both the setting in time of the occasion in the now of its contemporary iteration and the pulse in the moving that marks the passage from one occasion to another. For rhythm is never of the form itself. It activates the event’s durational complexity both across its becoming and in its culmination as discrete occasion.
