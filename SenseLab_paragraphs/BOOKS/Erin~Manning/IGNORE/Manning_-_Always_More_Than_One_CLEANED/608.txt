Let’s replay the event: Dawn Prince and Kanzi run along a fence, goading one another, moving one another forward in an eight-footed play. First, Prince moves with what she knows: “Naturally, I fell into the gorilla language I knew, a language of body, mind, and spirit.” She is not mimicking. Her movement comes from an affective attunement based on a longstanding connection to nonhuman languages: “When I was young I talked to animals in that language of silence. I knew what trees and streams were saying because they told me. I knew what sow bugs and snakes were saying because they molded me. . . . Sometimes my grandfather would ask me in the garden, ‘What are the worms saying today.’ ‘Fine fine slither dirt push good rotting green,’ I would answer, smiling” (Prince 2010). This, the language of the nonhuman, is a language that already tunes, for Prince, to her movement. She listens with movement, listens to how it expresses in the now of the encounter. She knows the welling event has regard for this movement, this expression in the moving of the more-than of human experience. Kanzi, in turn, plays with the language of movement she proposes, “both of us on all fours, smiling in a sea of fun and deep breaths” (Prince 2010). Prince and Kanzi, cueing, aligning, creating a rhythm, in counterpoint. Gorilla-like.
