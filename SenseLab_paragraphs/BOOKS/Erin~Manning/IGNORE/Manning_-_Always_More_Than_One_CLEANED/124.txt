A calm—unimaginable before—perhaps now activates the beauty of the desert’s intense colors, with the play of shade and light now tuning to the smell of the late afternoon while the flow of water around the many rocks of the canyon bed moves the walking.
For the nonphobic, for whom this hypervigilance is not necessary, there will likely have been all along an enjoyment of the breeze, an attunement to bird calls, resulting in a lightness in the posture afforded by the capacity to attend to more than the rustling grasses. The point is that the same macroevent creates different bodyings in different ecologies co-constituted by different emergent milieus. Not only that: these different contemporary bodyings also create potential resonances, sharing not the content of experience per se, but the quality of how the ecologies unfold in the futurity of their collective iteration. How a bodying evolves in this desert-event will always have been completely linked to how the milieu evolves and how it in turn affects the becoming-bodies in its midst. The ecology or associated milieu of the event will have been inseparable from its affect.
