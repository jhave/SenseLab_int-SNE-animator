Affect is always and only force. Think affect, as Deleuze (1988b) would say, as the force of the outside. The outside is here not juxtaposed to an inside—it is not about containment. The outside is the limit where life as force of form resonates. “There is first of all the outside which exists as an unformed element of forces: the latter come from and remain attached to the outside, which stirs up their relations and draws out their diagrams” (1988b, 43). When Deleuze speaks of the diagram here he is not speaking of a fixed form. He is speaking of a set of tendencies in resonance. In Deleuzian terms, we could think life as the diagram the outside calls forth. This diagram is full of permutations and potentials—it is the force of a coming-to-form that generates a shaping of experience. This definition of life pairs it with a life: life as the irreducible outside that has no ultimate form, no final measure. Life-living as always coupled with a life is the diagrammatic force that activates the collective individuation through which transindividuations emerge. For here the body is always already collective, transversed with the force of the preindividual as transindividuation.
