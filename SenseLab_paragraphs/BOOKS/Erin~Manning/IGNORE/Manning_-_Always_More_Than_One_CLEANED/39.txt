Across the series run any number of variations on the theme. The “what elses” are accidents of place and time. This means that in this processual logic the definition of an event mutually, necessarily, includes as codetermining factors what would in the traditional logic be judgmentally separated out from each other as essential properties and accidental qualities. It replaces this dichotomy with a distinction between a continuing variation (seriation) and its dosing with contingency (accident; the unforeseeable intervening variable). This is not a dichotomy, it’s a co-implication: the iterative variation and the variable intervention of contingency are codetermining. Neither could make sense—or make vitality affect—without the other. Even more radically, time (serial order, but also in this case things like time of day and time between iterations) and place (the matrix of copresence ensuring that any number of “what elses” will have the opportunity to leave their contingent trace) cannot be abstracted away. The singularity of the event is not only logically, but genetically, inseparable from its genericness. They are “one”: the singular-generic. As a “general idea,” the singular-generic includes spatial and temporal coordinates, working together, to bring seriation and contingency together into the unfolding of the event. “The” event cannot be thought apart from the co-implication of space and time: spacetime. A philosophy of experience, then, has to do with singular-generic spacetimes of experience, in relation to which the most relevant questions are not “what” but “what else” brought together “how.”
