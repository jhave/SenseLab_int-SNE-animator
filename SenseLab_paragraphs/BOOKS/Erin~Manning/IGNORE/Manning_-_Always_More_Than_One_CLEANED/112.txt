For Whitehead, a body is a society—a body is a complex of feeling in cocomposition with life-living. On the nexus of being and becoming, a body is more expressivity than form. This is the complexity of Whiteheadian thought, that while it insists that an occasion marks the finality, the atomicity of a singular process, it continuously reminds us that the occasion is so short-lived that it is ultimately the multiplicity of transductions activated by its dephasings that defines experience. In Whiteheadian vocabulary, “each actual entity, although complete so far as concerns its microscopic process, is yet incomplete by reason of its objective inclusion of the macroscopic process. It really experiences a future which must be actual, although the completed actualities of that future are undetermined” (1978, 215). Each foray into worlding involves the generating of a field that is coconstituted by all the pastnesses and futurities that compose it. The question is not simply “what is the body” but “how will the bodying persist.”
The bodying persists in its self-enjoyment as process: “organic philosophy interprets experience as meaning the ‘self-enjoyment of being one among many, and of being one arising out of the composition of many’ ” (Whitehead 1978, 145). Bodying persists as the more-than that strives to activate the forces of difference within its generative potential. In this regard, bodying is a lure to feeling. Lures for feeling call forth new immanent associations and new assemblages, bringing these constellations to life in the complex intersection between this life and a life. “Feelings are ‘vectors’; for they feel what is there and transform it into what is here” (Whitehead 1978, 87).
