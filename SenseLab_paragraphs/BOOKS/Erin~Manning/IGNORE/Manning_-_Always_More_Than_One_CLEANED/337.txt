Moving through cue is landing decision. This is not a decision-fromwithout. As suggested in chapter 4, decision’s cut is the more than human force that repositions the field in the event of an occasion taking form: decision is how experience singles itself out as this or that. In the cut of decision, we know not the cue as such but only the nextness of its result: movement aligning. This nextness of movement-moving recalibrates the cueing bodies even as it recomposes the environment, event-fully poising the event for future priming. In this priming, the event is not poised for the repetition of the same. It is poised for difference. As Massumi warns: “If the cue were merely recognized, and the action triggered a simple repetition, its functioning would be downright maladaptive” (Massumi, 2011c, 71). Think of cooking together in a different kitchen and imagine the mess!
