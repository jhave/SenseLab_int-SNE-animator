Waltz with Bashir resists the resolve of a dogmatic political stance, leaving us instead at the very heart of the drama of the political barely-active. “Everything changes when the dynamisms are posited no longer as schemata of concepts but as dramas of ideas” (Deleuze, 1994, 218). How is the dramatic question. In its departure from the transcendental what, the differential how is what Waltz with Bashir is concerned with. How: how to conceive of relations of force over and above a power structure that puts the individual at the center?
