The dancerâ€™s ability to align to cue with more than habitual responses to forms of cueing allows her to dance into the cue in a recalibrating of collective movement. The dancer dances this recalibration, dancing not simply her own movement but the very mobility of the choreographic surface. This proposes a renewal of movement expressibility within the stream of movement-moving.
