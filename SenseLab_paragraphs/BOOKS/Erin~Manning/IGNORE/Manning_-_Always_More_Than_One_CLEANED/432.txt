A dance of attention is not a politics as such, but it does carry the germ of protopolitical potential. For if the political is about the tremulous in-act at the heart of experience in-forming, a focus, in the event, on its modality of attending must to some degree be an opening to a protopolitics. Attending here is aligned to Whitehead’s concept of concern: the dance of attention has a concern for the event in its unfolding. The dance of attention is the event’s capacity to make felt the ethos of its very process of coming to force of form. A dance of attention is a protopolitics in that it actualizes an ethos in-formation.
