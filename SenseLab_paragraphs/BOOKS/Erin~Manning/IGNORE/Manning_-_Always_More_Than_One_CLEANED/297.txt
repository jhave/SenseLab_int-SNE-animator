To make this clear the schism has to be maintained between movementmoving and discrete movements even while acknowledging that there are mechanisms that fold these two planes of experience if not into one another then across one another. This folding has effects. It gives resonance to form. It gives elasticity to time. Recall Bergsonâ€™s statement that duration has more than one rhythm. The becoming of continuity is the resonant continuum through which the nexus of intervals makes felt its quality of relation across the differentials of time.
