Forsythe’s choreography is replete with actual and virtual cues. He defines the cue as “an aural or visual signal that triggers an event.” Cues do “person,” as Arakawa and Gins might say, but they need not move through an individual body to have effect. The cue is an enabling constraint for structured improvisation opening onto the collective individuation not of an individual movement but of the body of the dance as a whole—what Arakawa and Gins would call an architectural body. More than personing, cues move the surface of the choreographic field, opening it to the complexity of infra-alignments and cues not taken. “When you stop, create silence. Do not stop individually,” Forsythe warns.7 To move is to move as a collective. As one dancer explains, “You get to know other people’s choreography so that if you miss a cue, you move on to your next sequence, or you look at someone else waiting for that same cue and follow them.”8 Cues transform the movement of the collective into a collective individuation, making felt the relational weave of the dancing surface as it unfolds.
