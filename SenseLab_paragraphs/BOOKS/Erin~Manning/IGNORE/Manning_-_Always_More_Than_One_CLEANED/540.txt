Two reds are active in Autistwork n2. The -ness of red vertically cocomposing with the purple line-shadow is what catches perception in the abyssing and moves the seeing to occur in a here-now of expressibility. The second red works differently, grounding an image temporarily having come to rest. Look for it in the right-hand corner of the painting in the triangulation of red-purpleness. This red-purple triangulation seems to settle vision—it appears for perception when the gaze is momentarily no longer caught in the vertigo of a more-than seeing—giving a certain resting place to the tumultuousness of perception. This second red is a reddening more than a redness, perception of color as such more than of quality or force. Where the redness—the first red—is an eternal object, a machine for continuous reorientation in the folding through of the fold, a quality of relation that holds the seeing-with to the abyss of its eventful nonrepresentation, the second red—the reddening—is the mechanism though which vision is invited to return, if indeed vision ever makes it back here. For with autistworks we run the risk that we never actually come to the groundedness of actual perception, that we never quite land.
