Forcing thought to its limit where the thinking and the feeling are one, Waltz with Bashir activates a protopolitics that merges, uncertainly, with the politics the film can never get beyond, pushing the political to its limit, a limit from which it returns—if it returns—as the dramatic image of its own bare activity, broken into shards of light, amber-gray. There is no face to latch onto, no expression to empathize with, and so we keep moving. Waltz with Bashir proposes more than it provides, offering affective tonality before content, providing color and force of form before it gives us a figure, a body as such. Waltz with Bashir thus propels us across the infrahuman topological surface of the image, forcing us to think not simply what but how—what surfaces is also how it surfaces.
