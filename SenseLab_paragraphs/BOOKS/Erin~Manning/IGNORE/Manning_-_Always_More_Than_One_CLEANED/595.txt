Pathology is never far away. Speciations extrude species. Surely there was plenty of stratification, hierarchy, habit? No doubt. But what makes Deligny’s choreographic proposition stand out is that he was interested not in fashioning a project that would define itself (and the autistic) once and for all but, like Félix Guattari and Jean Oury with La Borde, sought to craft conditions that would allow for an attuning of emergent relations in order not so much to heal the autistic than to activate the community toward a rethinking of the “we.” Deligny was interested in how a choreographic proposition might create drifts that continuously cut through, despite and with the powers-that-be, unraveling pathologies in the making.
