To move from a choreography of collective orchestration for a reiterative event such as One Flat Thing, reproduced to the choreographing of a participatory environment in the context of art involves the deployment of a new set of concepts as well as a tweaking of what choreography can do. In an orchestrated choreographic event for multiple iterations such as One Flat Thing, reproduced, movement is moved from within the performance itself, architecting a field of collective mobility that proposes an incipient architecting of a force of form that exceeds the bounds of the actual choreographic event. The question is how or whether participatory events for movement composition such as art installations activated by choreographic objects are also capable of producing mobile architectures.
