In Folds to Infinity, the objectness itself—the fabric’s texture and color, the shape of the buttons, the geometries of the patterns, the elasticity of the cords, the surprise of the magnets—is the first constraint. The choreographic object activates a limit, becoming an attractor for a certain kind of collective approach. This can happen through color: the diversity of bright color and luminous texture in the Slow Clothes collection immediately tends to attract a certain kind of enthusiasm in the participant, especially in children. This effect is backgrounded with the black Volumetrics collection, where the effect tends to be more environmental and the proposition more architectural, leading to a more tentative approach. In both collections, however, there is the draw of the magnets, inciting a playful excitement that, under propicious conditions, can undo the participant of the habitual selfconsciousness participatory art events can foster. As attractors, the magnets in Slow Clothes and Volumetrics are examples of little machinic assemblages that turn the fabrics into objectiles. They assist in tuning the Folds to Infinity object toward its propositional nature, emphasizing that this is less an “artwork” than a choreographic invitation for the activation of a collective dance of attention.
