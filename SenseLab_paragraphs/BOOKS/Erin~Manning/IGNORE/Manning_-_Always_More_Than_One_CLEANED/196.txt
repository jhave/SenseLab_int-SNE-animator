The dogs are an example of a desiring machine. They are a multiplicity that moves across experience in the making. They drive the film: they are relentless impetus, movement-across at the topological surface of memory and dreams. As such, they are markers, remarkable points not for the transcendence of the past—the unraveling of memory, the locating of its source—but for the future anterior, the becoming of the “it was” of the “not yet.” They are desiring machines for a potential to come. We never know what they can do.
