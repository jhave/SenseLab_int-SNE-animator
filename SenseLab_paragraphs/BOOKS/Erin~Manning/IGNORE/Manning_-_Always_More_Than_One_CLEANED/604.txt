In a piece entitled “The Silence Between,” Dawn Prince writes of an encounter with a bonobo chimpanzee, Kanzi, that sets the stage for a rethinking of the deep “regard” she shares with apes of all kinds. Having flown to Decatur, Georgia, at the invitation of Sue Savage-Rumbaugh, Prince finds herself alone with Kanzi. She writes: “Naturally, I fell into the gorilla language I knew, a language of body, mind, and spirit. Kanzi and I played chase up and down the fence line, both of us on all fours, smiling in a sea of fun and deep breaths.” Then something uncanny occurred: He stopped suddenly and grabbed his word board off the ground. He pointed to a symbol and then pointed to me and made a hand gesture with his eyebrows raised. It was clear that he was asking me a question. He repeated this series of words and movements over and over, until I said, out loud, “I’m sorry, I can’t understand, Kanzi. Let me get Sue and maybe she can help me.” At first, she was at a loss. Then after asking him to point to the word again, she realized he was pointing to the word “gorilla” on his board and making the American Sign Language sign for question after pointing to me. It was clear he was asking me if I was a gorilla. What was amazing, though, is that he didn’t know American Sign Language: he had seen a video of the gorilla Koko using it and must have not only remembered the signed words, but, not having known other gorillas, assumed that all gorillas understood sign language. If I was a gorilla, he thought, this must be a way of communicating that I would understand. (Prince 2010)
