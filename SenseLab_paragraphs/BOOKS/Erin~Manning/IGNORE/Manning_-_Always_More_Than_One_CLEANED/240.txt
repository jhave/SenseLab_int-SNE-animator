So far, the face as Levinas conceptualizes it is very reminiscent of the face in Waltz with Bashir. It refuses to be contained and operates as the topological surface of difference. But where the film significantly diverges from Levinas is in its emphasis on the infrahuman and on the question of response/ responsibility. In Levinas, the absolute alterity of the face, that “puts me in a relation with being,” calls forth a need for a response, and there is no question that this is a response directed at another human (1961, 212). Relations abound and encounters multiply in Waltz with Bashir, but these encounters are between abstract surfaces—face-color, face-sound, facedance, each of them operational in the tight circuit where the virtual and the actual coincide and differential relations play themselves out. Were Waltz with Bashir to demand “a response,” a human-to-human encounter before all else, it would risk falling right back into the transcendence of political pre-positionings. In order to create an opening onto the drama of the political where relations of force are what is at stake, and not individual power, Waltz with Bashir must do everything to avoid making the precomposed, prenarrated body of the human the center of life-living.
