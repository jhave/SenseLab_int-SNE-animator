Attending to the dance in the event-time of structured improvisation is dancing the incipient mobile architecture of distributed relational movement. Like its dance of attention, distributed relational movement is a concept that begins to touch the nonhuman that is at the heart of movementmoving.

The field’s proprioceptive surface is agitated by incipient relationality. Relational movement’s preacceleration is always already coursing through the welling event.
