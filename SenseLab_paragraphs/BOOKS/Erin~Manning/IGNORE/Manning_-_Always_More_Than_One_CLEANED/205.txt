Forgetting is memory’s sonorous continuum, a sonorous continuum created through sheets of repetition—the music video, the amber-gray-black, the bodies rising out of the water—each of which is imbued with a persistent refrain. These are differential refrains that play on repetition with a difference: Bach’s Piano Concerto no. 5 repeats three times, Schubert’s sonata is replayed in different versions throughout the film, the amber-gray-black returns again and again, yet each is interpolated with the surfacing imagescapes such that they are never exactly the same twice. The sonorous continuum resonates in the circuit of time folding in on itself.
