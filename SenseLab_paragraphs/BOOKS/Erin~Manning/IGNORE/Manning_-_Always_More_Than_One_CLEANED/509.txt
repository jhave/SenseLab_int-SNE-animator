Language that speaks the ineffable makes felt the collective individuation of a complex dance of attention that is less a straightforward means of denotation than an incipient choreographing of movements of thought. Across the associated milieu of relation that is its emergent field it calls forth a protopolitics that resituates the conditions for a body-worlding each time anew. This protopolitics does not yet distinguish between forms of life and forces for life: it brings into resonance the incipient potentials of lifeliving, cutting across this life with a life.
