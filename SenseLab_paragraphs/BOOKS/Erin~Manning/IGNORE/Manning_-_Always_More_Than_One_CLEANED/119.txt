The yellowness is a transindividuation. Transindividuations remind us that every event is a node of activity that is intensively relational. This color, this kitchen scenarioâ€”these are but passing points of contact, expressive culminations in a wider process of transindividuation: in the complex phasings and dephasings of life-living, yellow is a node passing through and across, an expression of a nowness always already traversed by forces that exceed it.
