The first issue that needed to be addressed was how the artwork itself crafts the problem. What is Folds to Infinityâ€™s implicit call? Does the fabric, the installation, the magnetic architecture, depend on the laying of hands? And if so, does it ask for a certain kind of touch? Does the fabric collection require a physical handling, a local encounter with this or that kind of visible or tangible interactivity? Is there within the ethos of the piece an opening that invites participatory techniques that tune toward the morethan of a local response?
