The initial tendency is to place movement in the human body. This is especially the case in the context of stage-based choreography, where the dancing body tends to be at the forefront. In chapter 5 I explore how movement moves in two distinct instances—in William Forsythe’s choreography One Flat Thing, reproduced (see figure 20), as featured on the Synchronous Objects website, and in the participatory installations of my own artwork, Folds to Infinity (see figure 21). Here, my focus is on the ways in which these two variants of choreographic practice create their own complex diagrams, a mobile   architecture.
A mobile architecture, as I suggest in chapter 5, is not a resting place for human bodies, nor is it a built enclosure. Like the diagrammatic praxis of the movement exercise recounted above, a mobile architecture is about the fielding of experimental spacetimes such that they produce an intensive turbulence that becomes the force for a distillation of absolute movement, for the making felt of how movement-moving merges with the actual in its unfolding. The mobile architecture of a choreography is not the plan of the movement or the partitioning of the individual bodies in space. It is the relational force that persists from the collective movement’s incipient cueings and alignings. It is the gathering of a force-field not of the bodies per se but of the active intervals their relational movement creates, intervals it taps into to make felt the more-than of a given movement composition.
