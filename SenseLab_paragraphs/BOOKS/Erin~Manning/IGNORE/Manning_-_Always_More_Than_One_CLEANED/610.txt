The one is of course, always more than one. It is an infinity of movementspeciations. Speciations make dancing-body, not the other way around. We no longer have one, two, three bodies dancing. We have an affective attunement. This affective attunement cannot be measured in linear time. It happens in a time continuously folding through the intervals created by the moving field. This time of movement-moving is felt by the dancers as a moment of uncanny synchronicity. Synchronous because the movements create a collective experience of time-shaping. Strange because the collective movement is slightly off, attuned to but in the difference of movement’s capacity to invent, creating “an ordered interplay,” yes, but also something more: a sense of having been transported into the more-than by the event. A field in counterpoint has been created. Any repetition of the exercise of counterpoint will necessarily create a different field. Each counterpointevent makes its own time.
