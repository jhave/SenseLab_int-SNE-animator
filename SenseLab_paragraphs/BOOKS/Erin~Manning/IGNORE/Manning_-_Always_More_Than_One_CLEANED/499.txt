Contrast cuts through the collective agitations of sense-making and parses their becoming-language into an intelligibility. It articulates polyphasing expressibility even while it subtracts for definite sayability. Contrast transduces. To transduce in this context is to write-with the shifting of registers of intelligibility, thereby creating new processes for the cocomposing of signification and affective tonality.
Thought plays a key role here. Once more, consider thought less as that which inhabits the register of language than as that which fields prearticulation. Thought in the feeling, in the moving. Thought in the preaccelerating is a certain kind of enabling constraint (recall choreographic thinking), albeit not necessarily at the level of language: think of a movement of thought, of the articulating of movement in a thinking that is coconstitutive with an environment bodying. Thought understood this way is a selected pathway through which experience unfolding begins to express itself. In a tuning toward language, thought regathers its force for expressibility not to translate the field of relation it in-gathers but to transduce it into a coming-to-expression.
