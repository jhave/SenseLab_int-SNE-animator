While allied to dance, choreography is not dance per se. A cursory exploration of the term on Google Scholar produces hundreds of entries that have little to do with dance—in fact, in the search for the term “choreography,” dance appears in relation to it in a consistent manner only after twentytwo webpages. What I find instead are papers with titles like “Choreography of the Dna Damage Response” (Lisby, Barlow, Burgess, and Rothstein 2004), “Chromosome Choreography: The Meiotic Ballet” (Page and Hawley 2003), “Choreography and Orchestration: A Synergetic Approach for System Design” (Busi, Gorrieri, Guidi, Lucchi, and Zavattaro 2005), and “Making Parents: The Ontological Choreography of Reproductive Technologies” (Thompson 2005). This is not to make light of the practice of choreography but to emphasize, as William Forsythe does, that “choreography and dancing are two distinct and very different practices” (2008, 5).1 As this chapter proceeds and bleeds into subsequent chapters that explore and activate choreographic thinking, it will be important to recall this warning of Forsythe’s that choreography and dance are divergent practices and that movement does not begin and end with the human body. While I often draw from the field of dance, my intention, alongside choreographers and thinkers such as Forsythe, Valk, Klien, and Gormley,2 is to think choreography not as the organizing principle of precomposed bodies but as a technique for bringing to expression the patterning of incipient activity toward the definition of a movement event. Activist philosophy.
