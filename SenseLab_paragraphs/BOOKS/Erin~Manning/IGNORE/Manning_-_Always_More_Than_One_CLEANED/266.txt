Suddenly the movement curves you in a way that elicits surprise—drop a curve appears in the moving in a way never experienced before. At the same time it is strangely reminiscent of a movement you have been striving to feel all along. You experience an uncanny “déjà-felt”—or déjà-unfelt—a direct experience of difference felt in the act. Difference because there are many movements that are akin to what moved you, yet the how of this singular movement-event has startled the original task, opening it up toward its more-than. This sensation of the more-than in the moving is likely extremely subtle and probably quite imperceptible to others, except in its qualitative force (which can make all the difference to the self-generating choreographic field).
