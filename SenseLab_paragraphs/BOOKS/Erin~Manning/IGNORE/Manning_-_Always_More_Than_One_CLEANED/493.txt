While prearticulation is a forerunner to language, it also weaves into language’s unfolding. Words are never just what they seem to mean: they dance, they gallop, they rest, they tune in or out, they call forth and efface. However they express, the incipiency of expressibility accompanies them, even if radically backgrounded. This force of expressibility within expression agitates language as its articulatory edge. When thus pushed to its limit, language makes felt on the strata of shared communication the aliveness of the associated milieu of relation. It recasts the myth that communication is simply the organization and transmission of content fully-formed. It generates a definition of the communicative as the fragile sharing of the ineffable in the nowness of experience in the making. Writing as the bringing to expression of wonder.
There is of course wonder and communication without language. What language does is tweak communicative potential toward human intelligibility. The expressive strands of movement or texture, of color or sound, shift as they meet word configurations and together with the affective tonality of worlds folding into expression, they create new rhythms, new urgencies, new environments.26 But keep in mind: an “awakening” toward communication in language is but one step of a much more complex relational process. This one step does open doors, does create an opportunity to be heard, but it is the quality of composing-with that really makes the difference, because it is here that language begins to participate in the matrix of the more than human, that language begins to be heard from the edges of experience in-forming.
