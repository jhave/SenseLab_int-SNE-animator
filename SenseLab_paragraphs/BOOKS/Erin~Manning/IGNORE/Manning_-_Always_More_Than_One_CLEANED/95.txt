Individuation happens through what Simondon calls dephasing. Individuation is not a linear, continuous process. In the vocabulary of Simondon, a phase is not a temporal moment that is simply replaced by another. There is never just one phase or one individuation, but overlapping phasings happening in nonlinear time. Dephasing can be seen as the instance where the complex nodes of incipient relation tune toward what can be singled out as a discrete iteration: toward a remarkable point. Dephasing is both this, the activity of a momentary culmination of a multifaceted process, and its ongoing transformation. The transformation spurred by the dephasing is what Simondon calls transduction, defined as a shift in level from individuation to individual, which is at the same time a shift that activates a new process or a new phase of a continuing process. Dephasings, seen from the point of view of the transduction they call forth, are at once how force takes form and how the rift in the continuity of an ongoing process is felt. Dephasing is about the activity of phases commingling to the degree that they generate a turning point that resolves, momentarily, into this or that singular event or discrete occasion of experience—a remarkable point that shifts how an occasion continues to become. Dephasing is what activates what Whitehead calls the becoming of continuity. In Eric Alliez’s words, “far from being the opposite of continuity, the break or interruption conditions this continuity: it presupposes or defines what it cuts into as an ideal continuity” (Alliez and Goffey 2010, 10). A body becomes “it-self” in the break of dephasing.
