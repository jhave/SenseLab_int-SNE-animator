The hope was that the techniques would activate a technicity that might orient the process in ways previously unimaginable. While there was a definite moment of aesthetico-political intervention (May 1–7, 2009), the emphasis of these techniques concerned both the specificity of the local events and what could be generated over time that might continue to feed a growing political process. Because the force of technicity is not measurable, there can be no “result” to such an event. How thoughts continue to resonate, how aesthetico-political practices created for local constituencies continue to evolve both actually and virtually—these are questions of technicity, and as such they remain open. What can be said with certainty is that it is possible to create an environment that tends to the political in creative and unforeseen ways, and it is possible for techniques to breed into technicities that far outlive their local enunciations. Collective individuation in the realm of the aesthetico-political takes careful crafting, but it can have important effects on the field of the political.
Paired with the careful crafting of technique, improvisation can play an important role as an emergent procedure for the creation of new associated milieus of relation, milieus that subvert the linear time of if-then. What improvisation can do is texture technique to flesh out its potential. It does so by making “if” an open question, a time-loop, a folding proposition for the moving. From habit to invention, from technique to improvisation, the form becomes a folding-through of time in the making. The time of the if becomes an if . . . if . . . that lands only long enough to transduce, to ingather the potential of the coming individuation toward the force of its already passing future becoming.
