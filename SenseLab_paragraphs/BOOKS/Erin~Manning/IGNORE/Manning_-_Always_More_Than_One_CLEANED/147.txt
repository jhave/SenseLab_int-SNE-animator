Something else is happening here as well. A technicity is developing that draws on the diagonal force of a moving body. Suddenly ribs become fingers, and shoulders become articulate. Forsythe explains: “When you move your shoulder, you can move it as expressively as the hand—the shoulder is the second most expressive part after the hand—the muscles over the rib are the serratus—they are like the finger ligaments going up the hand. Articulate your shoulder from the serratus.”2 When shoulder becomes quality of hand, organ becomes expression. The body acts in implicit relation with a movement that tunes to a different constellation of articulation. Body becomes bodying, and in this transduction, a series of new potentialities for movement are born. Think technique as that which perfects a system and technicity as that through which a process is born that composes the morethan that is the body’s movement ecology.
