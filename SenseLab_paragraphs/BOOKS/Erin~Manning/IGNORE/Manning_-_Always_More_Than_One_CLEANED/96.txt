A body, as such, is therefore extremely short-lived: the body cannot be seen as that which holds together across space and time in a kind of beyondness of the event. Body is event, known as such only in the collusions of a process shifting. Think collusion here as the force of agreement (or disagreement) between processes or within a process. A complicity. An attunement. Collusion brings a field of individuation to a certain resolve.
