Preconscious, affects alter the force of the event, shaping it beyond its actual constitution. Affects exceed the realm of the modal, tending toward the edge of experience where amodality takes shape. Think of vitality affect as a species of affect, an affective tuning that operates as a kind of virtual event across myriad actualizations, creating dephasings in experience. If, for Sternâ€™s core sense of self, the organizational stratum is the dominant mode toward which direct experience unfolds, vitality affect can be understood as a co-constitutive qualitative infrastratum that provides a tending-toward immanent feeling in the constitution of the event.
