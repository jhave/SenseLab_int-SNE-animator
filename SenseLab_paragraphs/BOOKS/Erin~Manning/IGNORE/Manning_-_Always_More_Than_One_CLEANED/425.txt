In a dance of attention, attention itself constitutes the limit. Attention not of, but toward. A dance of attention is the holding pattern of an almost unidentifiable set of forces that modulate the event. We do not attendâ€”the field attends, an attention sustained by the procedural rigor of a set of conditions, tasks, techniques that hold the event to itself even while elastically bending time to make space for points of inflection that create differentials of relation.
