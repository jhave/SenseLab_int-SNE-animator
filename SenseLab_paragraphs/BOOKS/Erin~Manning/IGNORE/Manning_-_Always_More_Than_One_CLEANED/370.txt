Techniques for the Everyday * While movement techniques for the stage might seem to be primarily focused on the body outside of the everyday, and techniques for participatory installations might seem to emphasize a group body (the subway, the sidewalk, the classroom), in fact both build on the associated milieu of relation. There is no arabesque that does not immediately and significantly entail the enveloping of a milieu into the movement: the air, the time of day, the quality of the space, the last arabesque, all of these shape this arabesque. Every movement is a relational movement. Whether choreographing for the stage or for participatory movement events, what must be honed is therefore a distributed relational body.
