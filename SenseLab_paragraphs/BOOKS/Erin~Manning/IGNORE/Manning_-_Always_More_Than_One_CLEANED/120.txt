An event never fully actualizes. Or, better said, the actual is never fully actual: it is in act. What is in act is not the body as such or the eventâ€™s timeline but its force of life-living. This force of life is the problematization at the heart of each transductive process, a problematization that incites adaptation, modification. This is not adaptation or modification after the fact: it is modification in the process of becoming, a multiphasing of potential operative on the strata of co-constitutive individuations.
