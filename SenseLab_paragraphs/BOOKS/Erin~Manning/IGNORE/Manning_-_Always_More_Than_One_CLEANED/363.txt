By the end of the event, a relational architecture had indeed begun to appear, in the form of an enormous spiderweb. The event had created its own choreography—replete with dancing human-textile sculptures in the midst of the growing spiderweb—tuning the choreographic object toward a mobile architecture. Folds to Infinity had morphed in a way that would affect the devising of future enabling constraints for architecting movement in my practice of event-based participatory art.
