Where in this matrix might we find the germs of a protopolitics? A protopolitics is a setting into motion of the conditions for political potential. Political potential emerges not from the representation of a given content, but through the eventâ€™s challenge to the very idea of form. Think the political here at the very incipiency of its coming to expression, as force of the in-act. And recall that in an activist philosophy, politics must always be understood as a sustained encounter with the modalities of the in-act.
