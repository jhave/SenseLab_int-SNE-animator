The in-itselfness of the object (or the animal) must be resisted as strongly as the in-itselfness of the human. Neither human nor object nor animal comes to experience fully-formed. It is the counterpoint of their speciations that is at stake in experience. This, it seems to me, is what can be taken wholesale from Kanzi and Princeâ€™s dance: speciations connect, cutting transversally across all genera, meeting at the level of intensities, motifs, creating styles, in the moving. An ecology of practices. A mode of existence. An activist philosophy.
