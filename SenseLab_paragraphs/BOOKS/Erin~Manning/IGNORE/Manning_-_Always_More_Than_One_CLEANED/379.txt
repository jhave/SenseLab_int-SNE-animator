But as was made clear when DJ first entered the installation space, participation with the work also means understanding the limits of touch in the singular context of each of the artworkâ€™s iterations. This, I believe, is what initially held DJ back in the context of our collaborative work at the SenseLab. For even before he had quite extended his hand to the mobile architecture that held Folds to Infinity, even before he had quite begun to engage with the work, he heard the unspoken injunction: get it right! DJ quickly retracted his hand and moved across the participatory environment to sit on an orange couch and wait for further instructions. The initial promise of intuitive co-composition had passed and been replaced by a distancing posture of reflection. Not in the least surprising: no one wants to play when it seems as though the rules of the game are laid out in advance.
