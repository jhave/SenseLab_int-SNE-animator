In an effort to conceive of a living networking of difference, Deligny turns his back on the psychiatric institution and especially on the psychoanalytic tendency to pathologize “the language we speak.” He proposes instead a cartography of everyday life that occurs in a mode of cohabitation where the vectors of necessity—the sharing of a site—reorient the question of the normal and pathological toward notions of dynamic mappings that affect experience at the level of movement itself. The project is not to make autistics more “like us”—to make them speak or act within the communicational matrix of societal expectation. It is, rather, to create a dynamic milieu in the everyday context that can make felt the force of prearticulation that lingers in the unsaid. This, he believes, will allow us to ask the question Tustin never addresses, the question of the between of words, thus reorienting what it means to speak in the first person singular.
Over the years, building on this explicit mandate to invent modes of relation that do not necessarily rely on words, a singular iteration of experience in the making begins to take the form of maps of movement, “tracings,” as Deligny calls them.7 These tracings, a collaboration between the network and the autistics, become incipient cartographies of an associated milieu of relation that builds on the way movement and life-living interrelate. The challenge, as Deligny conceived it, was to learn “to see language from the point of view of a mute child” (Toledo 2007, 679). A choreographic proposition.
