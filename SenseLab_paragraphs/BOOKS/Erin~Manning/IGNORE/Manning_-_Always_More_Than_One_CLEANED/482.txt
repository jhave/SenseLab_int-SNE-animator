For some autistics, language remains a frustration, however. Amanda Baggs has written about this on many occasions. Despite being an excellent writer, she often finds that words cannot get at the heart of the more-than she directly experiences, which makes language a continuous problem. She writes: “The way my thoughts work creates some . . . problems for language. And it’s not just that I haven’t found the absolute best combination of words to translate my thoughts with. It’s that on a fundamental level the thoughts don’t translate.”14 For Baggs, there is a sense that language just does not get to the complexity of worlding she would like to convey. While all of us deal with the impossibility of translation between modalities of experience, for autistics the challenge is exacerbated by perceptual/sensory overload and motor activation issues, both of which can make it difficult to use language as a trusted tool for communication.15 Added to this is their unpalatable experience of having been too often “spoken for” with the assumption that if they don’t use speech to communicate they have nothing to say. Writing of the frustration of being ignored when he does not immediately respond to a statement or a query, DJ Savarese explains that for him “the words [often] come too late,” urging interlocutors to be patient.
