But the repressed does not return. We are witnesses not to the victims of truths now uncovered, but to sheets of experience exposing at once the singular horror of the Sabra and Shatila massacre and the impossibility of containing it within an explanatory narrative. What returns is not the past but the future, the ineffable more-than. And toward this future is the figure of the face, the face we can never fall into, the face that resists affective recognition, the face that leads us incessantly across, onto the surface of an imagescape that folds, twists, undoes and re-creates itself at the complex intersection where life-living comes to expression.
