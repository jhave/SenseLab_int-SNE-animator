The fourth person singular is not “I.” It is a desiring machine that cuts across: “desire, by its very nature, always has the tendency to ‘leave the subject’ and to drift” (Guattari 1977a, 49; my translation). A desiring machine is a machine in the sense that it cuts, assembles, produces. It creates desire, and more desire, pushing the surface to the limits of its desiring potential. In Waltz with Bashir the desiring machine of the film creates an opening for transversal linkages without giving the fabulation moral standing, for desiring machines are “machinic montages that bring into conjunctions semiotic chains and an intercrossing of material and social fluxes” (Guattari 1977a, 54; my translation), never situating them strictly on the side of good or evil. Desiring machines only propel: they promise nothing. They create openings, intervals, fluxes of potential relation. They propose. They risk. And they move.
The fourth person singular is the protagonist of Waltz with Bashir, a protagonist that flirts with microfascisms of pure reminiscence as much as with the impossibility of activating the past in the present, a protagonist that cannot be resolved or recognized as such. Like all topological surfaces, the fourth person singular does not promise resolution. It desires folds. It assembles singularities. It is nomadic. “What is neither individual nor personal are, on the contrary, emissions of singularities insofar as they occur on an unconscious surface and possess a mobile, immanent principle of auto-unification through nomadic distribution, radically distinct from fixed and sedentary distributions as conditions of the syntheses of consciousness” (Deleuze 1990, 102).
