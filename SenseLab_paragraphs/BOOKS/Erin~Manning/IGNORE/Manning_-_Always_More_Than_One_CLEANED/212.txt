Intensity of feeling in Waltz with Bashir emerges on the volumetric surface of the becoming-body, the sensing body in movement, of the film itself. This becoming-body resists the quintessential sensitive surface by refusing to territorialize on the human face, except, perhaps, at the last scene, where the animation gives way to documentary footage. In this amodal field of experience, the becoming-body as surface is its own intensive multiple movement-across. It resists moving into a body, a personalized human body. It remains instead a biogram on the transcendental fieldâ€™s topological surface.
That the film moves between bodies in becoming, shaping the emergence of a life not as body but as biogram,24 does not suggest that it disregards the body. Quite the contrary. The biogram of the film makes Waltz with Bashir all about the body, all about the intensity of life welling. What Waltz with Bashir resists is the subjectification of this body, the stultification of this personal experience as mapped through the recognition of the face as the quintessential affective image. At the limit of the now of events diverging where sense and memory coincide in an active forgetting, the becomingbody is an attractor for the creation of nodes of resonance, of sonorous continuums where a face has not yet congealed. This is why the face in Waltz with Bashir eludes us. It is not yet fully-formed. Until the last scene.
