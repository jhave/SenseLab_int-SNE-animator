Each landing is a cue in motion. Each cue in motion is a dancing. Each such iteration of counterpoint in the dancing—the activation of a field of action that creates a coincidence of attributes generating an infinity of folds—is a proto-architecture. And each proto-architecting of choreographic thinking is an impetus for a mobile architecture in the making. This mobile architecture is never a simple iteration-as-structure of a past configuration or idea. It is created in the moving, moved by the enabling constraints proposed not only by the rehearsed cues that propel the organization of the dance, but also by the folding surfaces of the landings that never quite find their sites. The mobile architecture is itself a proposition for landing. It is less a figure than a diagrammatic praxis that marks the durational field of the dance in its eventful unfolding.
