Through an ecological sensitivity—a sensing-with that occurs across registers and scales—the writers foregrounded here emphasize how being is always a composing-with in a dance of attention that registers the echoes, the silences, the rhythms of language, its subtractions and unsayabilities. In this regard, autistics are indeed otherworldly (in a way we would be wise to follow): they lead us toward an otherness of worlding.
An otherness of worlding does not begin with the human: it engages with and across in a vibratory expression that must be “read between.” An otherness of worlding is always more than one. It composes-with experience, refuting the notion that the world is already known, pre-formed. This worlding is thought in motion, thought individuating in an amplifying incorporeality, a vibratory materiality. It is a becoming across registers of experience, “not the becoming of the individuated being but the becoming of the individuation of being” (Simondon 2005, 322). It is the dephasing of expression into a language of relation, cutting across signification, making felt at once the absolute imperative of being heard and the impossibility of saying, once and for all. What is singular about the autistic experience of and in language is that it emphasizes this tuning of language across its difference, making this difference felt in the writing.
As emphasized above, with expression comes subtraction, and with this subtraction, the field of experience realigns. For the autistic, and likely for each of us, the subtraction expression entails is palpable, sometimes even painfully so. To participate in language is to feel the associated milieu of potential regressing. But it is also to become capable of participating in an attunement. This attunement changes the stakes of the field of expression. Coming to expression empowers even as it limits. From potential to act.
