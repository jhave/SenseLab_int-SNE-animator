Vitality forms are the marker of life welling, of life-living beyond the thisness of content preimposed. There is no experience that does not carry into its realization the contours of its having come to expression. And these contours are nothing if not imperceptible—felt but imperceptible as such in the howness of their evolution. Vitality forms are not formed in advance by the content of the event they call forth—they color the coming-intoexpression of life as we know it, creating the allure of what comes to be without deciding in advance what it is that will come-to-act. “The vitality dynamic gives the content its form as a dynamic experience. The contents, by themselves, need not conform to any particular dynamic experience” (Stern 2010, 23).
