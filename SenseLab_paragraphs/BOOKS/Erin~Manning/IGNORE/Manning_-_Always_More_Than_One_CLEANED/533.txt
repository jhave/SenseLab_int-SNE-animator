To make felt the ingress of eternal objects into the realm of the actual is to make felt the ineffable quality of autistic perception. It is to create for the seeing the between of words of which Amanda Baggs speaks. It is to activate the very cusp where the resonant field of potentializing attaches to this event, here, for the seeing. This is exuberance at work. For there is nothing like making perceptible the vibratory edges of potential.
Autistic perception struggles with its necessary coexistence with neurotypical perception. Where neurotypical perception tends to quickly parse the object from the field of resonance, autistic perception tends to dwell in the shaping. Donna Williams writes: “I have vague recollections of being able to sense the surfaces around me. I have a sketchy sense of having been able to sense the wall and changes in its structure where some parts were more solid than others. I recall sensing this without looking or using touch, changes such as where a door or window broke up or changed the continuity. I recall a sort of ‘resonance’ with matter, a kind of non-physical bodymapping” (1998, 37).
