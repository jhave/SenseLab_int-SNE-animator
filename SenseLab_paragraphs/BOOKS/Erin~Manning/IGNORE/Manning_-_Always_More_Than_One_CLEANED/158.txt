Technique remains here as the tool for the crafting of the movement’s excessive share, of the more-than of form it continuously leaves behind. At this juncture of invention, technique, improvisation, and technicity are at close quarters—each builds on the other. In the SenseLab’s Society of Molecules, the technique may have been to collectively make a relational soup. And perhaps the decision was to follow conventions and buy vegetables at the market to actually make a soup. But once at the market there may be the sense that the newly formed group (molecule + emissary) is somehow already in the process of crafting this relational intervention. Perhaps it’s best not to cut this process by going home and beginning to cook? Perhaps a picnic on the sidewalk is a better option? And then, in retrospect, perhaps the relational soup wasn’t even the picnic but the movement improvisation that momentarily came to life in the market-gathering? Perhaps the recipe is not a meal at all but an urban intervention? The point is that this intervention did not come out of nowhere. The technique was the spark that set it into motion. Improvisation then opened the movement to what it could become, unmoored. If the event was successful, it will have generated a more-than of its technique. This will have been its technicity.
