This was not all immediately clear to me. What I knew at the outset was that DJ had sensed an expectation I had inadvertently built into the event, despite the sustained thought I had given to how the conditions of a participatory event are crafted. And so it became our job, our collective effort, for the next three days (and the months to follow), to better understand how touch came to embody the injunction I wanted to leave behind. Our work: how to conceive of a way of reentering the field of participation such that the politics of touch are no longer confined to the realm of tactful touch but are instead inflected toward the relational ecology a singular iteration of the piece calls forth when it is set into motion.
