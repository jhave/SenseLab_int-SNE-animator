Event-time is durationally multiphased. Every response to cue activates the future as it courses through the no-time of the decision in the present passing. No-time because the decision is immanent to the event’s recomposition. The event-surface becomes thick with time signatures. Dancers cueing through alignment move with the time of the cue’s making and all the preexisting and future-forming time signatures in the making, all in the no-time of decision. The no-time of decision coupled with the making-time of movement-moving brings the durational surface of the event to the fore, opening the sender-receiver relation to the collective individuation of a distributed relational movement.
