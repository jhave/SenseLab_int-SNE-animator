Making felt the more-than of expression in writing might be called composing-with. Composing-with does have its pitfalls: “When I heard the word banana while I was looking at a cloud, I labelled the cloud banana. Education, though, helped me settle my dispute with nouns” (Mukhopadhyay and Savarese 2010). Composing-with does not preclude misunderstandings, misthinkings, missayings: “What use are the feelings, when you do not know how to feel them? And the mind thinks another ‘apple.’ The body does a ‘banana’ ” (Mukhopadhyay qtd. in Iversen 2006, 96). Beyond the content of the utterance—its most bare communicability—composing-with makes felt the collective breath of the more-than in the saying, makes heard the fragility of expressibility in it tuning to expression. Composing-with makes felt the more-than of experience in the telling.
