Architecting mobility always involves creating new modes of existence. It is not so much about rebuilding the hospital as about resituating the question of how life-living expresses itself architecturally, procedurally. Modes of existence are transindividual, collective. “Novel ways of structuring” are experiments in collective individuation. The new hospital may not exist as a place, but it may come to life as a performative choreography that activates the force of a life in the living. If this happens, it won’t only be the building we have to remodel. What will need to be attended to is the concern for the event of its unfolding across strata that must resolutely remain more than human in their complex speciations.
