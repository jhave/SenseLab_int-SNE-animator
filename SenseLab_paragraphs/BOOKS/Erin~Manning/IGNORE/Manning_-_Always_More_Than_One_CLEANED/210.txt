This music video is yet another fissure in the surface of the film, the transcendental field now imbued with a new sense of danger—the danger of the unthinkable limit between silence, beauty, and death as it moves not in the soldiers’ individual bodies but across the shifting surfaces of their collective becoming-body. Despite appearances, this is not an aestheticization of death, not a microfascist tendency to “let art flourish—and the world pass away” (Benjamin 2002 [1936], 122).23 For such an aestheticization would privilege the individual, the One. Death is everywhere here, but in the morethan: it is felt in the tense attention of the killing field, in the shadows of the forest becoming cemetery, in the collective becoming-body of the biogrammatic surface of the transcendental field where memory and forgetting, movement and rest, beauty and terror coincide. The music video is not an aestheticization of death but the calling forth of the uncanny between out of which the then-now of experience emerges. It is active in the relation, in the movement of sound and color, its bodying choreographed as collective, its protopolitics felt as the very edge where the terror of war is most ineffable and the memory of its violence most ungraspable. It is in this relation, in the collective movement of the transcendental surface, that the welling of the political at its bare-active limit makes itself felt and becomes thinkable.
