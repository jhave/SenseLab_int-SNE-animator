Mobile architectures: “tentative constructings toward a holding in place”
(Arakawa and Gins 2002, 47). Architectures, in the words of Arakawa and Gins, that come into their own with the “ever-on-the-move body” in the tense of the tendentially indeterminate. Only nomads, Arakawa and Gins argue, have taken such architecture seriously. Perhaps not. Perhaps choreographers have been inventing modes of architecting all along, creating out of everyday movements to make felt how the collective individuation of participatory ecologies is always already architecturally inflected. Perhaps they have always already sensed that landing sites are dispersive, tangential, productive, and forceful, and must not be confined to preexisting or finalized structures of repetition. Perhaps choreographers have always already known that difference erupts no matter how often you rehearse, how often you practice counterpoint, how often you step onto the stage or the sidewalk.
