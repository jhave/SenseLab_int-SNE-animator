Overarticulation is the surging forth of the potential of a movement’s unfolding. It is the post of its preacceleration. It is the excess of the displacement, the making-felt of the expressive micromovements that populate all movements in the making. Think of the spiral as an example. A spiral as such cannot be danced. It is more duration than form. To spiral is to dance the future of a movement spiraling, to dance the overarticulation of the present passing. Each spiraling thus touches on the force of technicity, a technicity that can be amplified by emphasizing this tendency and composing with it. Take the spiral, diagonalize and torque it, “follow the curves of the body—send the curve out from the hip to the arm raising and curving overhead, and note the hip is still moving when the arm is finished. Note the feeling of cross-attenuation (tendu)—find the cross patterns of the stretch—go for the feeling of the skin, the skin will tell you how to do it. Now add rotation: like an octopus who can do ballet.” Seek not to locate the body in the afterposition of its having spiralingly diagonalized: feel its octopus. Dwell in the octopus and move it, leaving even this multiplying bodying-form behind. Move and exfoliate, as José Gil would say (1985).
