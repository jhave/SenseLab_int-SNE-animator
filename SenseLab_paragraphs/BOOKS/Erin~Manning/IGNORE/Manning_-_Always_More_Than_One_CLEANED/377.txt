The role participatory art plays in activating and rethinking a politics of touch was made particularly apparent to me in July 2010 when DJ Savarese and I began a collaborative project involving my artwork Folds to Infinity. Our plan was to generate ideas for how to bring participatory art to the autistic community: we had been invited by autcoM, a conference organized by and for autistics, to create an installation of the work.
