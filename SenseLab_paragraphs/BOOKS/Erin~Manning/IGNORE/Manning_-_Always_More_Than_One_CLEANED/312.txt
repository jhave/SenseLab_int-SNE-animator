The choreographic object activates experimentation and play by bringing together the pastness of experience (the object as we know it) and its futurity (the object-ecology in its novel unfolding). When an object no longer seems to be quite what you thought it was, and the you you thought you were begins to collectively individuate, and the experience of time no longer feels as linear, it’s because the event is beginning to take over. No longer as concerned with your “self,” you are now experiencing the potential of the future mixed with the resonance of the past: a futurity of pastness in the present. Event-time.
