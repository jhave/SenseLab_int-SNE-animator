“The living lives at the limit of itself, on its limit” (Simondon qtd. in Deleuze 1990, 104). The impassive face that culminates the scene of the men rising out of the water marks a limit. This limit is not a boundary. It is a cleavage, an interval that opens back onto the surface of the film’s imagescape. The face that creates no interiority haunts this surface. Because we cannot hold onto this surface, because its affect does not easily translate to emotion, into a circumscribed entity, enveloping recognition into itself, because we cannot sink into it, we instead feel-with its resonant contrast, its backgrounding-foregrounding, its movement-with the limit of memory expressing itself not as content but as tonality. We feel not for the life of this human body, but for the force that cuts across it, for a life, the burgeoning of activity across surfaces of life-living. We don’t feel empathy.19 For the impassive face calls forth a protopolitics not of personal identification but of co-constitution where what is staged is less a face-to-face encounter than an encounter with the beyond of the face, a beyond that calls everything into question including the place of the human in experience.
A life is not strictly of the human. A life is not interiority. It is pure surface. It cannot be lived as such. It moves across, its volumetric surface folding. It is pure experience, pure opening onto potential. It promises nothing.
