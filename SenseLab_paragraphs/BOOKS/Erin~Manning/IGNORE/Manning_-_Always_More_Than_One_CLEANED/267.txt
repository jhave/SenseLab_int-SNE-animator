This déjà-felt is not a return to the past—for it is clear that this feeling has not quite been felt before until its “beforeness” was acutely felt, just now. What is directly felt is a time-loop of movement-moving, movement moving the you you are now becoming. You are dancing two spacetimes at once, as they are dancing you. Drop the curve has become a proposition for dancing the interval of experience in the moving.
The force of a proposition is that it creates the conditions for tapping into this intensive felt interval of the between. It inflects the occasion, creating a relational matrix that transforms the singular elements into a network of potential, generating an appetite for difference in the associated milieu that is the event unfolding.
