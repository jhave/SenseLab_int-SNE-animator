Activist philosophy “begins as a principle of co-composition between coincident manners of occurring” and is allied to the claim in Whitehead’s process philosophy and James’s radical empiricism that relation, or the inact of an ecology of experience, precedes form (Massumi 2011b, 5). What is radical about activist philosophy is that it always begins in movement and never stops moving. It is, as I will emphasize throughout this chapter and in the following interlude, more objectile than object, more potential than form. “Neither potential nor activity is object-like. They are more energetic than object-like (provided that no presuppositions are made as to the physicality of ‘energy’ or the modes of causality involved in the energizing of events). For the basic category they suggest is just that: occurrence. Neither object nor subject: event” (Massumi 2011b, 6).
