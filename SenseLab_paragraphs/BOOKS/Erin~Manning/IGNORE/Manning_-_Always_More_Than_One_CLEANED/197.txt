Waltz with Bashir thus begins off-kilter, the amber-gray of the dogs moving into the ineffable event of memory’s desire. Memory crashes along the surface. It gallops, its claws scratching into the dark gray parchment to reveal not the surface’s depth but its present scarring. Yet memory can create new forms. The metastable quality of its movement-across is replete with its urge for transcendence. Desire can go both ways. This is the danger: that memory will fight to the death for recognition of itself as pure past, that it will create its own vortex of transcendence, that it will seek the hole of putrid history, creating new microfascisms in the making with the frenzy of vicious dogs out for revenge. This is totalitarianism at work. It stops thought.17
Anything that flirts with transcendence risks totalitarianism. And while fascism and totalitarianism do not strictly collude, fascism is seduced by the aura of transcendent truth that is situated in the myth of a past, fully formed. Fascism produces singularities that retell stories of belonging, that create regressive attachments. It tells dark stories as though they happened in the light of day and repeats these stories, creating doctrines from them. Fascism predicts the ending and moves toward it, suicidally. The quest is regressively circular. The search for the past that never was cannot but create the self-destruction of presents in the making. Waltz with Bashir flirts with each of these tendencies but in the end I think it resists them. Uneasily, out of joint, it proposes something quite different from the microfascisms that lure it: an uncertain field, a memory that leads nowhere but to its dynamic futurity.18
