Landing sites, as Arakawa and Gins (2002) define them, don’t need to actually either land or site. They can travel as immanent configurations of possible worlds, tweaking the affective tonality of an event while remaining virtual. Negatively prehended, as Whitehead would say—they can be felt as virtual tendencies that have the potential to act on future reconfigurations without ever coming to the fore as actual occasions.9 Cues also work like this. They propel tendencies that may or may not reach the surface of their articulated expression in the field of the actual. They float at the threshold of perception, they field surroundings, landing narrowly and widely, affecting, imaging, dimensionalizing. And they create paths of resistance and cohesion, propelling incipient actions even as they recast spacetimes of recombination. Active virtually and actually, cues move movement, and, in doing so, they catalyze event-time.
