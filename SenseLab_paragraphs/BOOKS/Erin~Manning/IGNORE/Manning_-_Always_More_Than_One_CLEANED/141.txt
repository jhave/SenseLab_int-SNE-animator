Cleave the notion of the body beyond the human. Connect it to all that co-combines with it to create a movement of thought. Keep the movement of thought in the world (instead of putting it back in the body) and see what it can do. Consider this image: you are in the garden, your knees covered in mud, hands deep in the earth for an early spring planting. Instead of seeing the earth as a quality apart from the knee attached to a preexisting human form, see the knee-hand-earth as a worlding, a force of form, an operative ecology. See this ecology as an active technique for creating, for the bodying, a taste of spring. Instead of thinking the body as separate from the earth, as separate from the arrival of spring, see the ecology knee-hand-earth in a spring planting as a technique for tuning the season. Notice that the more the knee-hand-earth constellation becomes its own intensive entity, the more the feeling of spring beckons even though the air is still winter-cool. Were this November in Montreal, there would definitely be no such feeling of incipient warmth: the gardening assemblage in that season tunes more toward closing things in than opening them up. What is different between these two scenarios? In the spring, the knee-hand-earth assemblage is tuning beyond its novembering technique to encompass a quality of tuning-toward: this is a gardening with an anticipation of the feeling of spring. Incipient smells, the quality of a breeze, the texture of the earth, all of these tune the technique of gardening toward what it can call forth here and now, what its assemblage can become in this day in May. This is not just about sewing a seed, it is about reconstituting the relation climate-body-environment. It is about becoming co-constituted by an environmentality in the making. The technique of gardening for spring has transduced into an incipient call for the season to blossom.
