Activating the becoming of continuity might look like this: go back to the épaulement. Note that the form the movement has taken has a quality that exceeds, escapes, or precedes it. Think of this quality as the movement’s interval. Recall that the interval is the latent relationality of form-taking— what connects actual movement to the virtual realm of movement-moving. Think the interval as the durational node that, while not yet actualized, holds the moreness of movement in-forming.15 Activate the interval without necessarily moving or altering the form. By activating this virtual share of movement, note that the actual movement opens itself to its more-than. The movement’s potentiality for the occasioning of its nextness is crafted by the incursion into its position of the interval as differential. When the interval is activated, what is danced in the nextness of movement-moving is the force of form instead of simply the position the form has taken. The activated interval becomes the carrier for a continuity in the making.
The interval is not added to the movement. It is the force or the processual quality within the form’s time signature. Even when unactivated, it is always there, a key aspect of the relation between the event’s potential for continuity and its concrescence into form.
