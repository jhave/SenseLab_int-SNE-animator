The beyond is not a spiritual realm outside the ecology of worlding that is life-living. The beyond is an interval of life-living, here-now in an incessant eternal return, as Nietzsche might say, active in the spiraling of interstices through which the edgings-toward of speciations continuously metamorphose. The beyond, a shaping without limit, infused with “the language we speak, / we who can see without looking” (Sinclair 1993).
