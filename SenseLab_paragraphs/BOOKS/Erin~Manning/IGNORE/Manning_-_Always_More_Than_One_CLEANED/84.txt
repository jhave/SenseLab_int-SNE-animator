Movement is everywhere, always, at all scales, speeds, and slownesses. Total movement, as José Gil would say. Or absolute movement, in Deleuze and Guattari’s vocabulary. Which means: in order to have a metric movement, one that is added or subtracted in a measurable way, we must cut the total movement, crack the duration that, otherwise, flows unimpeded through all expressions of the world. In this cracking, new durations will create new processes. There is never stability. And there can never be nonmovement—even in what appears to be complete stillness there is quality of movement-moving, force of form.
