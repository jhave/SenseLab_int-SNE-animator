While I do not want to underestimate the complex motor and neurological challenges that accompany autism, and would rather not fall into the trap warned against by Amanda Baggs—“If we were real people, people would see us as individuals, rather than heroes, tragedies, inspirations, or representatives of our entire impairment group”3—I want to propose that autistic perception, in its divergent, complex, and continually evolving forms, may open the way for an ethic of the more than human urgently needed today, focusing as it does not on the macrolevel of preimposed moral systems such as human-centered empathy, but on an ecology of practices, a focus that emphasizes hyperrelationality and dynamic expression in a worlding that is co-constitutive. With Amanda Baggs, Tito Mukhopadhyay, Sue Rubin, Larry Bissonnette, DJ Savarese, and so many others who have been (mis)classified as “low functioning autistics” yet are clearly “highly functioning” in their insight about disability, language, the body, poetry, politics, and life, I would like to suggest that autistic perception provides a window into an ethics of relation sorely needed today, an ethics that is concerned with the associated milieu of relation and the protopolitics it calls forth.
