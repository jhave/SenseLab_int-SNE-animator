The shaping of the more-than creates speciations. These speciations are hybridsâ€”not human, not environmental, not animal. They emerge across forces of life-living through the contour of the experiential matrix that is this or that coming-to-act. Speciation is not a question of scale but of mode: it binds the organic and the inorganic in an infinity of microperceptible yet tangible ways, creating new forms of life-living barely categorizable as form or matter.
