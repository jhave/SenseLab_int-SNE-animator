The body’s position in the field of relational alignment is more than a preconstituted posture. It is the proto-architectural, the diagrammatic how of the then-now of movement-moving. It is always collective and, as such, relationally distributed, proto-architectural because already mobilizing into the force of a volumetric taking form. You don’t strictly align to a rehearsed position, you don’t align to a person, you align to the mobility of the architecture of the dance dancing you. You dance its volume, the quality of its coming into itself, as much or more than you dance its position or form. You align to the relational complexity of cues as they dance the environment reconfiguring. You move-with the topological surface of experience, moving the environment that persons, activating the relation.
