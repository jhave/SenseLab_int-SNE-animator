“We are already reacting to a stimulus before we know what it is,” writes Stern (2010, 68). Think the shape of enthusiasm as the associated milieu of experience where the relational field is still in-forming. Remember: the associated milieu is not an external environment, nor is it a neutral between of two actualized forms. The associated milieu is the withness of every coming-to-expression. It is always with its associated milieu that a given occasion of experience begins to take shape. Enthusiasm is of the milieu, not an external qualifier. Enthusiasm is the force of a resonant intensity that continuously reorients the field toward the more-than of its potential. This reorientation is indeed “already reacting to a stimulus,” as Stern writes, but not through the specter of the “we.” It is not “we” who are reacting, for “we” are not yet. Co-constitutive worlding.
