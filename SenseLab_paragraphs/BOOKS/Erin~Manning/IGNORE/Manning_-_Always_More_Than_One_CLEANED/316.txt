Like his choreographies, Forsytheâ€™s choreographic objects are created with very precise conditions for movement experimentation: they insist on the precision of parameters for movement (technique) without divesting the movement of its potential for eventness (technicity). They are carefully crafted toward generating certain kinds of participation and yet unforeseeable in their effects. They are objectiles thrown into the world, and invitations to move-with.
