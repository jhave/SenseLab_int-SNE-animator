As more-than and less-than, language is a two-edged sword, particularly for autism activists who want the radicality of their difference across modalities of expression and perception to be respected in the name of neurodiversity. For them, the constraint language places on ideals of interaction—including the expectation of eye-contact —often excludes them from social encounters even if they can speak or write. They also rightly feel that any engagement with expressibility outside or beyond language as such is deemed secondary and, too often, irrelevant. “If I [don’t] interact with [the] much more limited set of responses [of spoken language] they judge my existence, awareness and personhood,” explains Amanda Baggs in her video In My Language. The autistic who does not speak or write in the language of the human—according to human mores of interaction—is quickly relegated to the position of living in “a world of their own,” a world considered far less rich: “Far from being purposeless, the way that I move is an ongoing response to what is around me. Ironically, the way that I move when responding to everything around me is described as ‘being in a world of my own,’ whereas if I interact with a much more limited set of responses and only react to a much more limited part of my surroundings people claim that I am ‘opening up to true interaction with the world.’ ” It is human language in the form of exclusively human-to-human interaction, more than anything else, that seems to function as the bridge to intelligence and, by consequence, to offer inclusion to the realm of the neurotypical.
