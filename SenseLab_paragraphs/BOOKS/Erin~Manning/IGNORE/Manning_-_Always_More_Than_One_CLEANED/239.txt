Levinas’s ethical philosophy is constructed around the concept of the face-to-face encounter where “the face is present in its refusal to be contained” (1961, 194). His ethics underscore the idea that the face cannot be comprehended or encompassed, and he is clear that the face must not be thought as “content”—that it ultimately cannot be grasped or touched as such. The face is always the face of the Other, it is that which underscores “the incomprehensible nature of the presence of the Other” as the first revelation of the absolute difference of the Other, a relation that is “maintained without violence, in peace with this absolute alterity” (1961, 195, 197).
