Memory as forgetting poses a problem that cannot be worked out in a linear fashion, a problem that is not so much its content than its persistent refrain, its persistent difference. The problem of memory is its affect, the way affect resides both here and there, in the play of sensation of time’s shifting surface. To remember we have to forget the what of memory and shift to the how of its strange vibrating surface. To remember, as Nietzsche reminds us, we must forget. Otherwise we fall into the clutches of the transcendent traps of nostalgia, guilt, and resentment that is memory’s “what,” memory’s tight grasp on the containment of a unique capsule that promises to move through time unchanged. This is not how Waltz with Bashir plays with memory. Through the music video, Waltz with Bashir brings memory to life in the resonance of the sonorous now of forgetting. It tells a story in sheets of affect, a story that never quite fits together, where events are more like hyperlinks than continuities in linear time. In Waltz with Bashir, to remember is to activate an interval for forgetting that folds across the metaphysical surface at the limit where the future-passing unravels. Memory thus tunes toward actuality, making felt forgetting’s sonorous continuum, “the locus of sense and expression,” sonorous in the sense that it is a direct experience of time as rhythm, a pure rhythmic image of sensation (Deleuze 1990, 125). This limit where forgetting meets the event is where sense “doubles up,” creating “the production of surfaces, their multiplication and their consolidation” (125).
