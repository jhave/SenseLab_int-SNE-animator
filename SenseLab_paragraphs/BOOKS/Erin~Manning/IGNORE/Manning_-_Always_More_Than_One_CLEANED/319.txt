Take Scattered Crowd (2002; see figure 13). This choreographic object involves four thousand white balloons suspended in a wash of sound. The balloons themselves are not the proposition. Scattered Crowd is about moving-through-quality—whiteness, airiness, lightness—such that the co-constituting spacetime of experience becomes a moving-with: relational environment invites relational movement creates ecology of event. When the balloons float in a relatively small space, this movement quality is generated by an instruction to move through the space without touching the balloons. A choreography of uneasy closeness, a choreography of sensual proximity. A scenario: a crowd-movement, the balloons strangely still in a field of tentative moving bodies alert to one another. In another context, when the room is much larger and the balloons more numerous, the instruction might be to create space with the balloons without tangling their strings. A scenario: space moving, bodies in co-composition with strings, balloons bobbing in a time of a collective slithering.
