It took three days, but finally it occurred to me to ask DJ what it was he saw exactly, in this field of experimentation. “Quiet green in a sea of noise” was his answer. “What shall we do to quieten the environment?” I asked him, realizing that the field of color was too much, too loud, too overwhelming to really engage with. We immediately took down the black, which DJ classified as “scary,” scary perhaps because of the color, or perhaps simply because of the injunction (Touch! Do not touch! ) it had come to embody—for it was the black fabric of Volumetrics that incited DJ to pull back in his initial encounter with Folds to Infinity upon entering the SenseLab for the first time. What became clear during this process of scaling back on color was that, for DJ, a color does not simply evoke a quality, it is a qualitative field in itself. He hears the qualitative resonance of color’s relational field in its emergence: he feels “fiery” for orange, he directly experiences “luminous” when he “sees” the varying shades of blue, purple, and pink of the dupioni silks.
