A politics without promise, as chapter 3 emphasizes, is a politics in movement. It is a politics in the making, an activist philosophy, as Brian Massumi might say. Activist philosophy is concerned with “coincident differences in manner of activity between which things happen [where] the comingtogether of the differences as such—with no equalization or erasure of their differential—constitutes a formative force” (Massumi 2011b, 5). Activist philosophy is not a politics yet. It is about the force of the political in its activation.
