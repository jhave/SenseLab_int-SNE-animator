Another Kind of Play * Second event: November 2008, McCord Museum, Montreal (shown in figures 18 and 19). In an effort to create a new magnetic architecture for the textiles that wouldn’t depend on hanging wire from the ceiling (the museum forbade any kind of hanging setup) a very different installation was created this time. Rather than hanging from fragile plastic tubing and metal wire, the fabric was draped over industrial-looking steel racks, creating almost anthropomorphic chromatic shapes.
