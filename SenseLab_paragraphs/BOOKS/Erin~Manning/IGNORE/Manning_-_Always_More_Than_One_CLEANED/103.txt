Feeling
A life does not come once and for all on the scene of the actual. It resonates on the cusp of the living, affective in tone. A life is experienced as the feeling of life welling across its dephasings. Think feeling here in the Whiteheadian sense, as propulsor to experience, always in the realm of the impersonal.
