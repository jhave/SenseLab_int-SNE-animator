The proposition, for Whitehead, works as an inflection that affects how a given occasion comes to expression: propositions elicit action in an environment of change. The proposition is a lure. It is a force that cuts into the incipient event to alter its experiential vectorization. The proposition, however, is never added on to an occasion. It is of and with the occasionâ€”its immanent cleaving. This cleaving activates the force of contrast within the occasion, opening the occasion to its difference. Contrast is here understood as the force of difference that activates the dephasing through which the occasion is felt as such.
