Nature’s play is never separate from the event of its coming into being in the same way that the occasion is never preceded by an already-composed notion of space or time. Nature is its speciations, active, always, in the time of the event’s making. Nature is thus never in-itself, in the same way that a species, a body, an individual, are never solely in-themselves. Nature is a relational field through which certain motifs become active, motifs that in turn activate new fields of relation in the time of the event. It is, in all of its eventness, a multitude of modes of existence, a field of creativity.
Key to what Whitehead calls “the creative advance” is what he terms selfenjoyment, the concern the event has for its coming to subjective form: “The notion of life implies a certain absoluteness of self-enjoyment” where each occasion of experience is “an individual act of immediate self-enjoyment” (1938, 150–51). Self-enjoyment is not a moral category. It is not about the enjoyment of this or that. Not the enjoyment of the subject for life, but the enjoyment of life in the event of life-living. Life-living, it bears reminding, as the continuous outdoing of any notion of life in-itself or nature in-itself. Self-enjoyment is the occasion’s concern for its own process, a process that always includes a certain more-than. This more-than, as mentioned above, is brought forth by the event’s capacity to exceed its physical pole. The physical pole is a concept in Whitehead that denotes the most bare aspect of the occasion, a concept that is inseparable from the adjacent notion of the mental pole (or “reason”), which he defines as the how of the creative advance.
