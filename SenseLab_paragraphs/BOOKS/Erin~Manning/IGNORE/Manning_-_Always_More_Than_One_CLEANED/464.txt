“Does he flap his hands all the time?” the clinical psychologist in a Calcutta hospital asked Mother. . . . I chose to stand in the corner between two glass doors, so that I could see as many reflections of my flapping hands as possible through the glass. . . . I wanted to continue seeing the reflections of that wonder room through the glass doors. I was invited several times to approach all those blocks and toys that were now laid on the table and do something with them. . . . I could do anything I wanted with them, so that the clinical psychologist could record it in her observation chart. . . . And each time I was brought near the table, I would go back to stand in front of the cupboards. How could I tell them that the shadows and reflections made me feel secure? (2008, 28)
What is sidestepped in the pathologization of autism as mindblindness by the likes of Baron-Cohen is the different modality of relational emphasis Mukhopadhyay evokes here. It’s not that Mukhopadhyay is suffering from a lack of relation, it’s that he is not interacting according to standard humancentered expectations, consumed as he is by the ecology of what is unfolding around him. This ecology is not an object per se—though it may appear as though an autistic child is indeed consumed by an object. It is less a thing-in-itself that captures Mukhopadhyay’s attention than it is an intensive shaping, a complex relational matrix, a milieu of light, color, movement, sound, and social context.
