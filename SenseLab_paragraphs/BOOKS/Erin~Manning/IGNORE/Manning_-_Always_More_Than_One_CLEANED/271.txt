When time itself becomes the focus of a choreographic proposition, what results is the realization that time is unsustainable. Forsythe explains: “I am inclined to believe that because we are bodies and possess perceptive mechanisms we also have time. I suspect our ability to construct time is predicated on the manner in which the body integrates its perceptions and upon the action necessary to generate these perceptions. The characteristic I would most associate with bodily time is the unsustainable. Nothing in the body can be sustained indefinitely” (2008). What is unsustainable is the experience of time in-itself. To manage this unsustainability, we tend to approach event-time as though it could be parceled out in manageable quantities of distinct presents, pasts, or futures. But despite our best efforts, event-time remains uncountable. Event-time is a miring in the multiplicity of nows—the now that has passed, the now that is passing, and the now that will have been, each phase of nowness contributing to the occasion at hand in a time-loop that resists the organization of experience into a linear continuum. To be in-time is to experience the uncanniness of being with the past in the future toward the present. Time as duration is unmeasurable, unknowable as such, unsustainable in experience.
