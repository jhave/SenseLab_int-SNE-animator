On the level of technicity, Ettinger’s work directly engages with the
quivering edge. At this edge, what she calls the “withdrawing of traces” takes hold “where aesthetics approaches ethics beyond the artist’s intentions or conscious control”—a withdrawing that stages an encounter in the erasing (Ettinger 1993, 63). This encounter is multi-phased and multiphasing. It begins, in Autistwork n2, as mentioned above, with a photograph that encounters a photocopy machine. Moving through a doubling of the grain, the photograph emerges retouched by photocopy dust—retouched by the ashes of its moving-through the appearing-disappearing image— such that it begins to disresemble itself, new edges and tendencies coming into appearance while others are backgrounded in the transfer. An addition for a subtraction.
