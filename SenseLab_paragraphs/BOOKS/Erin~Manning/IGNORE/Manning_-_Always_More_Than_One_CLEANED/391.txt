Folds to Infinity was initially conceived as an intervention into prêt-àporter culture. My research question was what might it mean for a body to express itself as a continuum in the dressing rather than to have to prefit the clothing? While conventions of haute couture were based on the creation of the garment for the body in its present form (without an ideal of shape or size preinscribed), haute couture was never democratically available for the populace at large. Would it be possible to reinscribe certain aspects of haute couture—the singularity of creation for just this shape, just this movement of the body-becoming—while still making the garment available to all, as it was meant to be in the prêt-à-porter tradition with which we are more familiar? Adjacent to these concerns was the exploration of what it might mean to dress relationally. The force of the magnets—and the disquiet they cause in the dressing, creating sporadic folds and spontaneously connecting to pieces in their proximity—would make it very difficult to compose alone, thus proposing an opening for a collective practice of dressing.
