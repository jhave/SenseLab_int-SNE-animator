The first step in the procedure above,1 recursively attended to in subsequent steps, already exceeds a visual mapping. For while the initial boundaries of the diagram may seem to hold to a perspectival order, their potential for variability is experienced as soon as movement is introduced in the third step: find an opening and move into it. Here, the activity of space-shaping is emphasized. This space-shaping, while it may seem to take off from the representation of a space—a vision of a diagram fully-formed—actually emerges more through a feeling of space shifting than a visualization of a form.
