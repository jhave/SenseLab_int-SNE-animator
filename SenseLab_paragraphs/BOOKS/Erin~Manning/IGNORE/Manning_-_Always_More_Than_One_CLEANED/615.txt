The culmination of the movement-moving is a territorializing. Something has come to form, and with the coming-to-form, a certain casting into itself of movement has emerged. “An ordered interplay.” From here, techniques can be abstracted and positions extracted. Territories are shortlived, however: movement keeps moving, occasions keep perishing. So what is left? Motifs, expressive tendencies. These motifs are the mode of appearance of a vacillating territorialization—a mobile architecture—that is an abstraction of a subjective form. With them comes the tonality of the event’s form-taking.
