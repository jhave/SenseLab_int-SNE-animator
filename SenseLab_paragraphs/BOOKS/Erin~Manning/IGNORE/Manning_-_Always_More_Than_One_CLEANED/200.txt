A life is felt in Waltz with Bashir as the activity of memory’s deformation in the event’s coming to itself. It is wholly impersonal, yet singular. The dogs move through it but never come to rest in it. “It’s a haecceity, that is no longer individuation, but singularization: life of pure immanence, neutral, beyond good and evil, since only the subject that was incarnated in its midst made it good or bad” (Deleuze 1990, 361). Absolute movement. Aberrant movement. “The entire mass of living matter contained in the internal space is actively present to the external world at the limit of the living . . . to belong to interiority does not mean only to be ‘be inside’ but to be on the ‘in-side’ of the limit. . . . At the level of the polarized membrane, internal past and external future face one another” (Simondon qtd. in Deleuze 1990, 104).
