“Coming back” relies on the idea that language as the model of humanto-human interaction is the passport to a human life worth living. Without language, the presupposition is that the child dwells in nothingness from which he or she must be saved. When language is thus understood as the basis for meaningful existence, it situates autistics without language outside of the realm of meaningful experience. Catherine Maurice, whose children—like many others—were diagnosed with autism after an initial entry into language, refers to her children’s loss of language as a “descent” into autism, making autism synonymous with the loss of her children: “this autism thing was taking over the very essence of who Anne-Marie was. . . . Stripped of our illusions, we found Anne-Marie to be suddenly alien” (1993, 31, 46).23 Maurice clearly sees her daughter’s loss of language and withdrawal as the loss of her humanity—without language she has lost her essence and has become alien: “The mornings brought no relief. She never called me. . . . ‘Good morning, sweetheart!’ I called out. She didn’t even turn her head. Suddenly I sat down on the floor, back against the wall. ‘That’s not Anne-Marie,’ I whispered” (1993, 57). The race against time to reclaim the child for the pleasures of a human-centered universe secures the dichotomy between the neurotypical—who owns language and with it the facility of human contact—and the neurodiverse, for whom language— and, of course, empathy and relationality—is absent: “I was in a race against time,” Catherine Maurice writes after her daughter Anne-Marie’s diagnosis, “and either I found someone or something that truly helped or I had lost Anne-Marie forever. It was as simple as that. There is something about autism that to me gave meaning to the phrase ‘death in life.’ Autism is an impossible condition of being there and not being there; a person without a self; a life without a soul” (1993, 57).
