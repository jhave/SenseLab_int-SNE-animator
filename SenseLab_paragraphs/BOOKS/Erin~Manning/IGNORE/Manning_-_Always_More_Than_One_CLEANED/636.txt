New concepts, when they really do their work, activate speciations, which, in turn, affect how societies evolve. A society: “A type of order. . . . A nexus. . . . Endurance. . . . An animal body is a society involving a vast number of occasions, spatially and temporally coordinated. . . . Each living body is a society” (Whitehead 1967, 203–5). As chapter 2 emphasizes, what we usually call a body, a body in the narrow sense, is not a knot of speciations (a nexus), a society. This is the force of concepts, that they insist, they irritate, they agitate in the cross-fertilization of occasions and societies. These agitations play out on the level of the occasion, but as the occasion perishes onto the nexus, they also affect the contributive realm—for they continue to make ingress. Concepts resonate transversally, creating a vibratory field that affects how future events are composed. They feed the futurepresenting with their appetite for more. They are counterpoint machines: they create a field of action that provokes a coincidence of attributes to produce the excess of an ordered interplay. Gorilla-like.
