Infants bathe in pure experience. This state of quasi-consciousness is of the edge, not the center. It is only of the skin if the skin is considered in its topological foldings with and through the associated milieu that is the world’s becoming. Pure experience is a relational, amodal state. It reachestoward experience in the making. In this state, worlding is perceived directly. Qualities are foregrounded, and through the double articulation of content and expression, individuating senses of self begin to emerge. Feeling-vectors predominate, not cognitions, actions, or perceptions as such. These feelings are co-constitutive of being and worlding, invested, always, in the milieu and its associations, never deliberately linear or causal. “The elements that make up these emergent organizations are simply different subjective units from those of adults who, most of the time, believe that they subjectively experience units such as thoughts, perceptions, actions, and so on, because they must translate experience into these terms in order to encode it verbally” (Stern 1985, 67).
