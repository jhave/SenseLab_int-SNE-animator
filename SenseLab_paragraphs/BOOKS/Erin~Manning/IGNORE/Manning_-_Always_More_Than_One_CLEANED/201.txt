Aberrant because it does not evolve in any linear sense. It changes. The surface senses not the past but its presenting, its making future of the interior/exterior fold, the expression of its limit as singularity. “Singularities are distributed in a properly problematic field as topological events to which no direction is attached” (Deleuze 1990, 104). How singularities resolve into the present-passing has to do with the interval between memory and forgetting, “the memorandum which is at the same time afflicted with an essential forgetting, in accordance with that law of transcendental exercise which insists that what can only be recalled should also be empirically impossible to recall” (Deleuze 1994, 140). The problem: “solutions are engendered at precisely the same time that the problem determines itself ” (Deleuze 1990, 121). Waltz with Bashir takes us far away from empirical memory. It creates memories out of lived relations, in the relation itself. Radically empirical, memory in Waltz with Bashir moves with the forgetting that is essential for the creation of a problem worth having, a problem that forces thought to the surface, across the surface.
