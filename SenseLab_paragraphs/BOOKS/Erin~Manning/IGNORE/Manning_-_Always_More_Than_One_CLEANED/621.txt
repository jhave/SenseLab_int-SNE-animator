Territory’s play undoes the dichotomy between speciations and species, locating them not as opposites but on a continuum. For speciations are complex aggregates—they affect on a multitude of strata, including that of the species, elasticizing the territory even as they move in concert with it. It’s not that there is no longer a bonobo and a human, it’s that the event never begins there. It begins in movement, in the mobility of relation where there is always more than this particular species-combination. For as soon as the territory becomes an active milieu, it becomes a field of movement constellations. Species is a general category always abstracted from the movement of the event.
