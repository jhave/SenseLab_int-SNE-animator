Now take some of these tendencies but tweak them toward a different dance of attention. Remember that a dance of attention is a mobile surfacing that is immanent to the event in the making. Never mistake the built architecture itself for the event: architect mobility! Bring the architecting back to procedurality and explore what kinds of assemblages are called forth. Note that there are procedural fissures in the account of the hospitalâ€™s architecting. Hospitals are also for birthing. They are also for exhibiting art, for the gathering of friends and family, for species innovation in laboratory research.
