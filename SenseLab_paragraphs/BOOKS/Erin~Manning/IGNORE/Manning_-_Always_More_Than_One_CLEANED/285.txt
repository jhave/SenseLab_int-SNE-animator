To walk is to move with the infinite complexity of micromovements— preacceleration’s activation of a million instabilities, overarticulation’s generative rightings and productive destabilizings. Without the interweaving of the future-past in the present through memory’s active role as movementgenerator in-the-moving, coupled with the tight interplay of microperception and micromovement, we couldn’t simply get up and walk.10
When we walk, each step is already virtually imbued with all previous walkings, all previous proprioceptive tendings toward a verticality that moves horizontally, all kinaesthetic sensings of a balancing in the between of multiple equilibriums. But it is also poised toward the future. We walk in a future-pastness whose virtual plenitude of experience and experimentation assures a metastability of balance. It’s not exactly that we remember how the ground touches the foot and the weight shifts as the body transfers from step to step. It’s that the stepping recalls itself in the act. Futurepastness. The memory of having-walked is in the walking. This is a memory on the edge of perception, a memory in-act that activates in the moving the multiple metastabilities that make this singular choreographed movement possible. Even when apparently passive, memory remains active, active in the folds of the future-presentness of perception, its time signature specious. It is this passive-active memory of the metastabilities garnered from a lifetime of walking in the walking that saves us from a fall when the snowy ground suddenly turns to ice or when we almost-trip over the edge of the sidewalk.
