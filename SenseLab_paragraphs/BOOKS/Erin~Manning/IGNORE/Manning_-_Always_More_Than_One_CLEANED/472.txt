To articulate the ontogenetic worlding of experience—to make the jump into language that is so vital to inclusion in everyday life—it is necessary to hone a modality of subtraction. Subtraction from the chaos of hypersensory stimulation is a central aspect of all experience: it is what allows many of us to tune out the deafening music while we are having a conversation, or to abstract meaning from rhythm when listening to a piece of writing. For those, however, for whom this kind of subtraction proves difficult (if not impossible), there can be a sense of deep loss associated with parsing out certain aspects of experience from others. For the parsing out of sensation from experience entails a loss of relational potential. Amanda Baggs often mourns this. But, as autistic writing has shown, this can also be less a deadening of experience than an enlivening of it by other means.
