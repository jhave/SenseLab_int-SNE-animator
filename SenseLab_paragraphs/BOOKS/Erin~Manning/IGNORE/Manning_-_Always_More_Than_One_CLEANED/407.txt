Space-shaping is a procedure not so much for the creation of a stable version of space as for the bringing forth of active intervals—associated milieus—that are the diagram’s force of form. What the procedure of a diagrammatic praxis such as the one above can do is make felt the processual nature of space in-forming for experience. One of the ways this processual quality of experiential spacetime is felt most keenly is through movement, in particular preacceleration, the virtual premovement that accompanies all actual movement. What preacceleration does is make felt the tendings already in germ before a displacement happens, emphasizing that movement happens less in an individual body than in the intervals proposed by movement’s inherent relationality.
Space-shaping is immanent to the activity of diagramming. The diagram does not preexist its shaping. This is felt in step 4: Locate another open space. Move into it. As the participant responds to this step, they find that space is reshaped in the (virtual) moving. They experience a relational movement, a moving-between that connects the first diagram to the incipient diagramming in the shaping. The diagram that may have seemed to be an individual form now reveals itself to be an emergent multiplicity. They are not moving into a space so much as moving the opening through which space is crafted.
This makes felt a quality of body-spacing—not your body exactly but a body-elastic co-constituted in the shaping—that itself becomes part of the ecology of the diagrammatic praxis. Spacing and bodying transindividuate, fashioning a multiple singularity: a body-diagrammatic. The bodydiagrammatic is a procedural “I” that stands not for the subject but for individuation. For the process is not one of defining an individual—a body, a form—but of making felt the merging of topological registers of coconstitution: space-bodying, time-spacing. Step 5 is everywhere present: Feel time’s elasticity. Feel the space shifting.
