One of the ways of becoming attuned to distributed relational movement is to become sensitized to the collective attunements activated by cues and alignings in everyday movement, thus learning to work with the array of decisions in that wider field of movement, human and nonhuman. This involves working with a modality of attention that lurks below reflective consciousness. For it is impossible, even in the most organized choreographic process, to map out every possible alignment. A choreographer for the proscenium of the theater, let alone a choreographer of participatory ecologies, cannot predict how the environment will mutate. Much can be gleaned from participating in moving sidewalks. As with the cooking example, it is striking how rarely rapidly moving bodies run into one another or into open doors, garbage cans, or bus stops as they walk on busy streets. In preparation for a participatory choreographic event, time on the sidewalk is key.
