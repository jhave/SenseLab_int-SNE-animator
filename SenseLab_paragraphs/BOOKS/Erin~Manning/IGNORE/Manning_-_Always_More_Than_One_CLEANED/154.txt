The first was the technique of the “emissary.” Each molecule was invited to choose an emissary as well as to name a host. The emissary of each local grouping was paired with the host of another group. Sometime in the five months preceding the main event, the emissary would travel to the host group (virtual voyages were a possibility where resources did not allow physical travel). The role of the emissary was to make “first contact” with the other local (molecular) culture. To facilitate the unannounced meeting, “movement profiles” were compiled and distributed to the emissaries. The movement profiles described the designated host’s habitual daily movements through the city, so that if the emissary so desired first contact could be made in a performative fashion taking advantage of the element of surprise.4 Emissaries were encouraged to use standard forms of communication like mobile phones and addresses sparsely, focusing instead being guided by the movement profile. Upon meeting, the host’s job was to gather the molecule together and treat the emissary to a “relational soup.”
