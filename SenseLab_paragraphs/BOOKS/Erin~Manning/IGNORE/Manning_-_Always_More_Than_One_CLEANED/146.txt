William Forsythe shows his dancers that, for instance, you can lift an arm across the body by using the extension of the limb, creating a standard épaulement. Building technique on technique, however, he then shows that the amplitude of this movement’s qualitative force is fundamentally altered through a movement of the rib cage. Instead of pulling the arm, push the rib cage and the body becomes a diagonal force, a torque, hip-shoulder syncing with an elasticity that dances almost without effort. The first option is a movement from the pretense of a stability. The second is a movementmoving. This is technique building on technique.
