Another thing this simple procedure demonstrates is that all movement is relational movement. There is no shifting of a diagram, no shaping of spacetime, that isnâ€™t implicated in the relational constellation of a wider ecology of movement-moving. While relational movement can operate between two bodies, can be felt as the relational interval of the preacceleration of a body moving toward and with another body, relational movement never operates solely between two.2 It is always multiple, always already distributed in morphing spacetimes of experience. The proposition: distributed relational movement is the form movement takes when it becomes the ontogenetic expression of diagrams in the making.
