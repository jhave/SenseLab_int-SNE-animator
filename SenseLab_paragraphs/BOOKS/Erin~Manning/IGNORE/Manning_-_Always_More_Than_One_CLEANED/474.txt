Savarese writes: For decades it has been assumed that Autistics are the victims of an obdurate literality, which leaves them baffled by figurative language. While this may be the case with ‘high-functioning’ Autistics or those with Asperger syndrome, it is not with classical Autistics. The published writings of DJ Savarese, Tito Mukhopadhyay, Amanda Baggs, Jamie Burke, and Larry Bissonnette, to name just a few, reveal how metaphorical the “severely” autistic can be. Indeed, they are compulsively so and not simply when they are writing poems. . . . Only recently have some of
these Autistics been exposed to creative writing instruction, and the results have been nothing short of spectacular.
