“Life means novelty,” writes Whitehead (1978, 104). Life is appetition, appetite for the more-than. Life always in tune with a life—the force of life-living across the organic and inorganic realms where speciations converge to create territories of difference. To restrict life to the physical plane, as Whitehead notes, is to starkly underestimate the play of its capacity for invention. Whitehead has a strange name for the force of appetition that activates the more-than of life-living: he calls it reason. “Reason,” for Whitehead, is another word for the force of thought that is immanent to the event. This force of thought is never thought as that which lands onto the event from outside its concrescence. It is the reason of nature, in nature, a concern with the very edges of the thinkable in its nonalignment to consciousness. For
Whitehead, nature thinks.
