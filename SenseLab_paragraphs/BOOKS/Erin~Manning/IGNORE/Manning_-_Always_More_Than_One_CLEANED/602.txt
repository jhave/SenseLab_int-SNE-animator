“These maps, to tell the truth, do not say much, except that we in no way know what the human is, nor the common” (Deligny 1980, 19). The gorillas regarded me. To them, I had never been away, because I had really been there once. Time is different to the gorillas. It is about being together, not about being apart. I am content to feel that kind of time, and I close my eyes and smell deeply the hot lemon smell of gorillas and the thick sweet smell of the hay.
