Writing the more-than is to feel-with the world as it comes to expression, to feel-with the bare activity of wor(l)ding. For Whitehead, every occasion of experience is composed of feelings. These feelings fold through the affective tonality—the concern—of the event in its emergence. They arise not from the subject per se but from the field of relation itself. Every worlding—every prehension, every grasping-with the world—is a feeling, in Whiteheadian terms. An event is a composition of feelings selected from the panoply of potential, a complex of affective tonality agitating toward actualization. No occasion of experience can be abstracted from its feeling: “The feelings are inseparable from the end at which they aim; and this end is the feeler” (Whitehead 1978, 339). The feeler is the subject of the experience, a subject that is in every way immanent to the event.
