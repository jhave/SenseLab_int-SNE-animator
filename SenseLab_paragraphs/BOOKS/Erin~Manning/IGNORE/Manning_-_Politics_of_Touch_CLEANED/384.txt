To be a body is to be thick with thought. To think is to open the way to- ward the political as that which must continually be rethought. It is impor- tant to register the political voice in this narrative I am weaving in order to assess the vitality of the kind of expression made possible through sensing. A politics that senses rather than investing all of its energy in the practice of signiﬁcation is not a politics without rigor. Indeed, there may be nothing less rigorous or more apolitical than the acceptance of signiﬁcation as the basis for experience. This only reinstates the dichotomy between reason and sensing.
