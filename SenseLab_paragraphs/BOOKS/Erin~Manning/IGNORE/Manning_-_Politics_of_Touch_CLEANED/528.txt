Other words or concepts could stand in for a BwO: politics of touch, body, prosthetics of sense, errant politics. The key is that the concept be evocative of what a body can do. Like bodies, concepts exist to be unpacked, to be modiﬁed, to alter the timed-spaces and spaced-times they create. They are not solid. They are incorporeal but not metaphorical, real but abstract. “‘What [a body] can do’ is its capacity to be affected, which is necessarily and constantly exercised by the thing’s relations with other beings” (Deleuze 1990a, 269). But “as far as it can” does not mean as far as you would. Or could. It means that the body can choose, relationally, to act. “[The ethical difference] lies in the immanent existing modes involved in what we feel, do and think” (Deleuze 1990a, 269). What makes the (ethical) difference is that this activity of relation is joyful.
