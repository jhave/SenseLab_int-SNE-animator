Endosymbiosis challenges the narrowness of Darwinian and neo- Darwinian thought, suggesting a way to think engendering on a symbiotic level. Research on endosymbiosis explores the Archean Eon, 3,900 million years ago, when bacteria (nonrespiring membrane-bounded cells) invented genetic engineering as a mode of sex and reproduction (cloning). A simpliﬁed account would go something like this: First, a sulphur and heat-loving bac- terium (called a fermenting “archaebacterium” or “thermoacidophil”) merged with a swimming bacterium. This symbiotic merger became the nucleoplasm that is the basic substance of the ancestors of animal, plant, and fungal cells. Oxygen was toxic to these bacteria. With the spreading of oxygen, anaerobic bacteria merged with respiring bacteria. This symbiotic linkage was characterized by one bacterium entering an other, growing and repro- ducing (cloning) in it forever. Microbial bodies were thus forced to co-adapt through parallel processes of communication and reproduction due to the imminent pressures of the environment. These bacteria reproduced primarily through mitosis. Larger, more complex cells evolved.
