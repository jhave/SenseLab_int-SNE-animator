here perhaps still too strongly linked to individual subjectivities. Bodies do not only share. They reach. To reach is not a condition of possibility: it is potentiality17 —that which is not already known, embodied, experienced. “One would ﬁrst need to learn how to think the ‘each’ on the basis of the series or best works of singular ‘each times’” (Nancy 1994, 71). Politics: disorder, rogue states, untouchability. Touch: reaching toward, movement. A politics of touch stages an approach. Rogue states are dangerous: is there any other kind of state? My BwO becomes a war machine, imperceptibly, momentarily. Touching, I space you, us. I do not deﬁne a new state. I matter differently.
