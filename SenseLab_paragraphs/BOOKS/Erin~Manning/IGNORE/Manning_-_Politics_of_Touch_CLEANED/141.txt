Tango as we know it found its debut in the streets and bordellos of Buenos Aires, conceived largely by immigrants searching for a vocabulary to express their place-lessness in their new country. A music and dance born of many inﬂuences, including rhythms of Africa, Europe, and America, its music from Spain, Africa, the Caribbean, Italy, France, and Germany, it is a verb that means “to touch.” No matter how we deﬁne the tango and its “origins,” touch never strays from the importance of tango as an improvised encounter with an other as other. Nothing prepares us for this touch, no place, no time, no identity, no sexuality. Interestingly, this touch has remained rela- tively untouched by the rampant exoticization of tango’s movements of desire. For touch as an improvised reaching-toward—a politics of touch—is not easily exoticized, especially if we consider exoticization to be a hierarchical classifying of an other. Touch cannot be subsumed to a single event: touch demands a re-accounting that would defy every such organizing within the grid-forming practices of sovereign signifying intelligibilities.
