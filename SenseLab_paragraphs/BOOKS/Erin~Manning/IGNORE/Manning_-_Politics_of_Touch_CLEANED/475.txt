These are words through  which the body-politic of the nation-state tends to operate. These are words that underpin the discourse of the secure body. “If you do not relinquish your BwO and assume a stable form, we cannot protect you.” Some bodies are easier to secure than others. My lesbian body, my gay body, my diseased body, my female body, my aged body: these bodies are more costly. But even these bodies are useful to the state: they make possible the insecurity on which the need for security is predicated. Be secure! Conform! Even your distorted body can be taken into the fold! Conﬁrm your conformation by organizing your excess: we may be able to protect you! But hide your difference at all costs!
