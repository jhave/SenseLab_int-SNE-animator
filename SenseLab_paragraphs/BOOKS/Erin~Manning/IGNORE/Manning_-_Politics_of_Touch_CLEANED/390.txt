Beardsworth writes:
The impossible aporia of law releases the possibility of possibility. This impos- sible possibility constitutes the measure by which all judgments can only fail to measure themselves. Hence the measure of judgment is nothing but the im- possibility of its measure; in this impossibility the singular arrives. (1996, 44)
