Deleuze and Guattari write: “The organism is not at all the body, the BwO; rather, it is a stratum on the BwO, in other words, a phenomenon of accumulation, coagulation, and sedimentation that, in order to extract useful labour from the BwO, imposes upon it forms, functions, bonds, dominant and hierarchized organizations, organized transcendences” (1987, 159). Stratiﬁcation takes place. Concretely, it gives space and time, constricting the timed spaces in which we live. But these spaced times are also ephemeral. They can be re-vectored. Constellations can be generated that subvert the vocabulary of “within” and “without” on which these kinds of space-times are predicated.
