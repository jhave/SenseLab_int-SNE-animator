Engendering gender is a risky enterprise. Within engendering, matter takes many forms. Nature is abstract potential, leading us toward the Spinozean statement that we do not yet know what a body can do. Engendering here presupposes the body’s capacity to deviate, create, and mutate. To think nature in ﬂux is to foreground the nonlinear dynamics and the unpredictable potential of the transformation of matter at stake in all endosymbiotic rela- tions, be they biological, technological, or political. Sex becomes an event. Event-fully, sex actualizes modes of relation and reproduction of informa- tion that unleash affect at all levels of a body in-formation. A body never stands alone: it becomes a body-biological, a body-technological, economi- cal, political. It can also become a gendered body, but ﬁrst and foremost it is an engendering body reaching toward its individuation-in-relation.
