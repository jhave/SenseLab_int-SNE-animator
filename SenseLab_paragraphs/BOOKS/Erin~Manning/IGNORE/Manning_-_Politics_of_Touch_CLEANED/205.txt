Might we then conceive of the touch of God himself, or the almost- touch we encounter on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, as the temptation to relay to God the unknowability of life on earth? In this scene between God and Adam, we recall the gesture of God’s index ﬁnger reaching towards Adam’s ﬁnger without ever quite touching it. Did Michelangelo, whose work evokes touch brought to life through sculpture, know something about touch and its virile potentiality that most biblical scholars and art historians continue to ignore? Was Michelangelo, with his image of the almost-touch, perhaps trying to relay to us the impossible violence of that ﬁrst touch, a touch that causes the fall from grace, a touch which, had God reached Adam’s ﬁnger, might have given God a real glimpse of humanity? For God cannot touch in this manner, that is, not if touch is a reciprocal act, since God, as he is conceptualized in the Bible, is the absolute other through whom every notion of alterity is transformed into the self-same and with whom reciprocity does not even come into play. God knows better than to touch: “God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die” (Gen. 3:3). For God, reciprocity is embodied in the very condition of touch: it is reciprocity above all that Adam must avoid if he is to resist humanity.
