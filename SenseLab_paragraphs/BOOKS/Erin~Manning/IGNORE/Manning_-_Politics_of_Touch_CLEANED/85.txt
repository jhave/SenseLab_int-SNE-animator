Gesture as such has nothing to say. It is only relationally that gestures create the possibility for exchange. Gestures negotiate both transgression and understanding. I use a gesture to communicate something to you that I don’t feel I can adequately “say.” What interests me about gesture is not its strict positioning within a politics of touch versus a sovereign politics or in a politics of language versus a politics of affect. I am concerned with the manner in which gesture provides an alternate (and existing) vocabulary of the political. I am interested in the ways in which gestures render unheimlich the “messages” operating within the polis. I am fascinated by the ways gestures provide alternate positionings of means and ends. For, even though gestures can be rehearsed, falsiﬁed, mediated by a consensual thinking that privi- leges certain exchanges over others, even though gestures can be devices of and in language as well as prostheses to sensing bodies in movement, ges- tures continuously slip outside the grids of intelligibility of organized struc- tures, potentially resisting containment, calling forth a vocabulary of the political that can exceed sovereign methods.
