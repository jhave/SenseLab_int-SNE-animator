When I reach out to touch you, I create a BwO that is populated by intensities that pass and circulate. I do not create a scene of touch. I do not create a model that can be re-created or interpreted. Your BwO is always out of reach. It is out of reach because it is not, strictly speaking, operating “in” space and time. It is spacing time and timing space through intensities that come to pass, that reach me momentarily, that decompose in the reaching, that sense without making sense, that make sense sensing. There is no ultimate moment, no ﬁnal organization to the BwO: remember, what I reach toward is not your body, but your BwO. Our bodies are not organic to the concept of touch. Our bodies are continually inventing—intensely inventing — what can be thought as touch, bodily. The BwO is a multiplicity that challenges the dichotomy between the one and the multiple. Reaching toward you, you become multiplicitous, you multiplicitously multiply me. “A plateau is a piece of immanence. Every BwO is made up of plateaus. Every BwO is itself a plateau in communication with other plateaus on the plane of consistency. The BwO is a component of passage” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 158). How does touch operate on the plateau? Where is politics? Consider the BwO as a component of passage that introduces the potential meeting of BwOs. Would that not be a politics? These meetings on the plane of immanence are smudges in time-space, conﬁgured as reachings- toward that call forth the potentiality of a touching that could be a politics. A politics here conveys the potentiality of a continuing movement toward, a taking-further of the movement through which touch is instantiated. Poli- tics of touch implies and is implicated in touching the untouchable.
