Whether or not we fall prey to the myth of the measure of equality within a system of calculation, a politics of touch is a reminder that the measure is never more than an attempt to reconsign the incommensurable. Justice,13 in this regard, is always a renegotiation of the incommensurability of liberty and equality. Justice is democratic and democracy is just because justice must be about making a decision, about taking response-ability (even when I return to the grid to count the squares of equality and liberty), about fac- ing the abyss of the incommensurable.
