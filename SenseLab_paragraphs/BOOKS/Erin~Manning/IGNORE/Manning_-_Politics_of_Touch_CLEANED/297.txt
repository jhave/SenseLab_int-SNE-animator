She asks how constraints such as sex “not only produce the domain of in- telligible bodies, but produce as well a domain of unthinkable, abject and unliveable bodies” (1993, xi). Butler’s argument concerns the manner in which the materiality of sex is forcibly produced. She wants to know how bodies are materialized as “sexed,” and how and why certain bodies come to matter. Butler focuses on sex as part of a regulative practice that produces the bodies it governs. The materialization of sex takes place (or fails to) through highly regulated practices.
