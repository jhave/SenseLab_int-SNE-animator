“The BwO is what remains when you take everything away. What you take away is precisely the phantasy, and signiﬁances and subjectiﬁcations as a whole” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 151). Reaching-toward is political because it develops a space-time that is repeatedly altered. When I reach toward you, I challenge the idea that I can know you, that I can interpret you, that I can tactfully “touch” you in the sense that I can convey to you your separateness. The BwO is tactless: I can never predict the manner in which my BwO will unfold. This folding is of the skin, but not the skin as envelope. The skin of the BwO is the in-folding of space and time as event-ness. The skin is the incorporeal excess that provokes a memory of a reaching that arrives, in passing, to imprint skin with the resonance of its evanescence.
