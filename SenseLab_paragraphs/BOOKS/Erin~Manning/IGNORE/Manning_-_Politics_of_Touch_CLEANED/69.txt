Toward the beginning of the twentieth century, tango was born as a music and a dance. Alienated from the Argentine middle class, tango expanded quite quickly in the underworld of Buenos Aires. The expansion of tango took place while Buenos Aires—a city in which more than 50 percent of the population was composed of immigrants—quickly grew from 187,000 to 1,576,000 inhabitants (Ferrer 1972, 146). Argentine society in Buenos Aires at that time was characterized by the presence of an overwhelming majority of solitary men uprooted and socially destabilized by conditions beyond their control. Many of these men frequented cafes and bordellos, ﬁrst for the women, then for the tango (De Ipola 1985, 15).
