So many mistakes and misunderstandings occur in Happy Together, not least of which is Fai’s acceptance of the victimized position as cook and servant of Po-Wing. But desire is not silenced so easily, even now: it is in one of the following scenes that tango makes an entrance between the two men. This ﬁrst and last tango - an ambiance that will return later in the ﬁlm — seems to be a ﬁnal attempt to evoke their bodies through an unpredictable movement of desire. Unfortunately, too much has been destroyed in this friendship to be able to salvage their love affair, though feelings of closeness seem to remain until the end. Tango’s emergence is therefore true to its form: an emergence of the possibility of touch without return. As it is wont to do, tango makes no promises, especially not the promise of desire. Tango is about touch, which is about movement, which is about desire, but this is not a promise of possession or culmination: it remains a desire to move. Bodies in movement speak to one another as only bodies can, in and across space, promising nothing but this movement, this listening to a moment in space-time. It is essential to recall this when thinking of a politics of touch in order not to fall into the trap of attempting to domesticate either movement or desire through touch. Touch is temporary, it is an event, an invitation, and a response. Tango is but one instance of that reaching-toward.
