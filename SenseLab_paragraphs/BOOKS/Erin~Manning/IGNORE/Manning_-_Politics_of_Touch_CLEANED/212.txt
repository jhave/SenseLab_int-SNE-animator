Arrestation and the provocation—the reaching out toward and the touching of an other—exist in an economy of violence. Violence never befalls innocence. This is perhaps the point. The traditional biblical text would like to associate Adam and Eve to an innocence that is sullied by the experience gained through the act of touching, and then ingesting, the apple. But this claim of innocence is itself a violence, for there is no text that is not always already written and therefore implicated in the violence of transformation. Adam’s “innocence” before God’s extended ﬁnger is a dis- cursive innocence idealized to prevent us from acknowledging that to enforce a dichotomy between touch and innocence would be paramount to suggest- ing that our bodies exist as separate entities from our senses. There is no body without touch, as medical ofﬁcials are quick to point out: a child left un- touched is often a child left to die. Why this pretense, then, that Adam’s state before the Fall is one of “untouchability” in the face of God? And why, once again, God’s ﬁnger extended toward Adam’s in Michelangelo’s fresco?
