Touching an other in a reciprocal gesture of unknowability underscores the incompleteness of the state, which invariably remains incapable of fully subsuming the body into its realm. Touch emphasizes the discrepancy be- tween the violence of the body as multiplicity and the violence of the body as identity. What we know about the state is that it cannot operate without violence: State power cannot exist unless it holds the ultimate and exclusive right to force. And this violence reproduces itself in the name of security as long as the state has not identiÔ¨Åed and rendered docile all the bodies in its midst (and along its borders). The violence of touch is, on the other hand, not about policing. It is productive. When the state takes over the body, it attempts to create a bond of reciprocity that is solely hierarchical. When the body leaves the (imaginary of the) state, the body begins to cre- ate other bodies, other worlds. Violence is operational in both these in- stances. Yet, when the body departs from a sovereign, territorialized, bounded space to a worlding, a chronotope emerges that cannot be cleanly delin- eated but through which a juxtaposition and a convergence take place that multiply space-time through textual layerings, creating new bodies-in-movement. Space grows with the body and shrinks with the state.
