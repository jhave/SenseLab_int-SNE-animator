Derrida writes: In political philosophy, the dominant discourse about democracy presupposes this freedom as power, faculty, or the ability to act, the force or strength, in short, to do as one pleases, the energy of an intentional and deciding will. It is thus difÔ¨Åcult to see, and this is what remains to be thought, how another experience of freedom might found in an immediate, continuous, and effec- tive way what would still be called a democratic politics or a democratic political philosophy.
