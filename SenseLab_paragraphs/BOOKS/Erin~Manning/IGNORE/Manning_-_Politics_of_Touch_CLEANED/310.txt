Margulis deﬁnes symbiogenesis as “an evolutionary change by the inheri- tance of acquired gene sets” (1998, 9) wherein living beings defy neat deﬁni- tion. The symbiotic world individuates violently, passionately, indifferently, ﬁghting, feeding, mating, dancing, dying. Generating novelty, symbiogenesis brings together different life forms through matings that are often incorpora- tions. This is not a one-to-one procedure whereby individuals can be delin- eated within an economically stable system. This process is metastable. Fixed individuality is a concept that cannot exist within a symbiosis that causes complex alterations in the form-matter relation. Symbiogenesis brings together life forms that are “even more unlike than their ‘unlike’ parents” (Margulis 1998, 9). These individuations become larger, more complex uni- ties. Individuations become compositions that become populations that become multi-unit symbiotic systems.
