The surplus value of code of which Ansell Pearson speaks is compatible with Simondon’s concept of potential energy. Bifurcations produce intensities that multiply. Antagonistic organisms evolve into metabolic truces. Genetic pacts are formed. “Each of your cells is an amazing crossbreed, both more mixed up and more uniﬁed than anything found in a medieval bestiary” (Margulis 1997, 77). Engendering foregrounds variation. Variations emerge through the parallel network of relations between populations and terri- tories poised at the edge of a phase transition from one state to another. Margulis’s theory of endosymbiosis suggests that bodies-in-symbiosis merge out of networked organizations that provide connections between popula- tions and environments. Bodies become in relation to an ecosystem of bodies. This model emphasizes cellular interliving, “an inﬁltration and assimilation far more profound than any aspect of human sexuality [that] produced every thing from spring-green blooms and warm, wet, mammalian bodies to the Earth’s global nexus” (Margulis 1998, 20).
