What we begin to perceive, in this last section of the ﬁlm, is the manner in which the body can become what Massumi calls a “sensible concept” through a politics of friendship. If perceptions are, as Massumi argues, always possible actions, what we experience in the ﬁnal scenes of the ﬁlm is the possible action of a friendship, a friendship as a possibility-to-come. And since there is no ideal beginning or end to a politics of friendship, we are faced with a vision of the “perhaps,” framed, as it so often is, in Wong Kar Wai’s haunt- ing cinematography, through discordant and hesitant shots where self and other remain asymmetrical to themselves and to one-another. The camera refuses to name, to classify, to hold down. Instead, singularity is maintained, envisioned through a camera that remains curious, tentative, engaging.
