To think the senses as prosthetic invites us to explore the surprising path- ways toward which our senses lead us. These movements are never direct. They are interlaced, synesthetic, nonlinear. A politics of touch is an engen- dering of this kind of prosthetic thinking of the event. A politics of touch is an expression of politic’s need to expand its horizon beyond the organism to the sensing body in movement. When sense moves beyond the organism to a sensing body in movement, our bodies extend toward the pacts we create in the name of multitudinous bodies and politics. Our bodies become political. Politics throughout has been about the supplement. There is no original politics to be undermined by a politics of touch, just as there is no original body to be subverted by the BwO. Our bodies act: we know not what the body can do. Politics is what the body does. Since we cannot ﬁrmly place our body in a pre-cognizant system, we cannot know what can be done po- litically. All we can know is that there are ways of knowing that complicate the pathways between bodies and politics. Senses ﬁgure large here.
