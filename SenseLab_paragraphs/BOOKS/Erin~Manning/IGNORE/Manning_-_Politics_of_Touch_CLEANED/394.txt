This is not to say that law itself opens the way for a democracy-to-come. It is to underscore the ways in which even state politics move to different choreographies of time. Within the state, a narrative is written that binds security to judgment, bodies to law, even while bodies and laws continu- ously escape the straitjacket of striated space-time. Skins regenerate as laws are rewritten, themselves rewriting the passage of time, reinscribing bodies into their midst. The question is how to rewrite justice as the avowal of time’s différance.
