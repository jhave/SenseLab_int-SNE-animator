Happy Together is haunted, from the outset, with the impossibility of reaching the Iguazu Falls, the ideal tourist journey. In the ﬁrst scenes of the ﬁlm, we watch as Po-Wing and Lai-Yu Fai lose their way, unable to make it to this tourist destination. There will be no idyllic reaching of the falls for these two Asian tourists who recognize already, in their buying of a lamp that mimics the movement of the Iguazu Falls, that the falls exist only as pre-packaged gadgets in stores catering to tourists. Always already recognizant—despite the fact that they as yet have no vocabulary for this gath- ering of time and space—of the challenges of attempting to “enter” time and space rather than creating it, Lai-Yu Fai and Po-Wing hesitantly accept for the moment that the closest they will get to this idyllic rendering of Argentinean nature romance will be through the supremely tacky lamp they buy on their way. In this lamp where the falls are reproduced, they see pictured their dream of new beginnings inﬁnitely produced for the pleasure and consumption of the tourist trade. In this lamp, they see not bodies in movement but a replicated instance of static repetition, a dream of renewed beginnings of perfect symmetry.
