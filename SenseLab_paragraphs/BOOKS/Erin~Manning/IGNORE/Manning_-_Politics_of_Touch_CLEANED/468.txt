“You never reach the Body without Organs, you can’t reach it, you are forever attaining it, it is a limit” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 150). The BwO is literally that which I reach toward when I attempt to touch you. The BwO is the body that remains anathema to the body-politic about which the sov- ereign nation dreams. Sovereign politics cannot uphold a thinking of a BwO because this “body” cannot be contained within a stabilizing imaginary. This concept brought forth by Artaud—“there is nothing more useless than an organ” (in Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 150) —is a concept that rallies against the state. It is a concept that speaks of experimentation, radicaliza- tion, censorship, repression. It is a concept that promises nothing (I can also create a disciplinary BwO, or a sick one, a deranged one, an addicted one) except movement toward something that is not “me,” that can never be “me” in the strict sense. If touch is indeed a central ingredient in the cre- ation of the BwO, we might argue that touch is that which most strenuously denies the concept of “me” that is at the heart of a politics of identity. There is no identity to the BwO. There is only movement.
