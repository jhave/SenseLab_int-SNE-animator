Will-less politics would be politics without movement. Dictatorial poli- tics, perhaps. Or politics of boredom: politics of the One. A politics of touch calls forth the will in every decision to reach toward another, in every relation of forces. For Spinoza, this notion of force does not promise a departure from servitude. That we live in potentia only means that we can choose our pacts; it does not mean that we will not write servile ones. For this reason, Spinoza does not oppose autonomy and heteronomy, spontane- ity and obedience. The pact promises nothing. Power is not hierarchical. It is an expression, an event in and of the body, a projection of bodies onto and into the world, a worlding. The pact is not a limit-concept, though limits are often perceived and even reached. Spinoza suggests that the constitution of societies is “the chain of actions and passions of the multitude: a multi- tude reducible to the totality of individual powers that compose it, but ir- reducible to a sum of bilateral relations (or of exchanges) among individuals” (Balibar in Montag and Stolze 1997, 193). Causality is not what is at stake here. Sovereignty is never entirely certain of where it is going: “the potestas
is only effective to the extent that the individuals who have constituted it permanently recognize it as constituting a law for their will” (Balibar in Mon- tag and Stolze 1997, 194).
