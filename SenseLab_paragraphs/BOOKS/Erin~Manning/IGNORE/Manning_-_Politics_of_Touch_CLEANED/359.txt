Sex is a mode—a modiﬁcation or intensive extension of matter—that is analogous neither with sexual reproduction nor with sexual organs. Sex expands on all levels of material order, from the inorganic to the organic, from the biological to the cultural, from the social to the technological, economic and political. Far from determining identity, sex is an envelope that folds and unfolds the most indifferent elements, substance, forms and functions of connection and transmission. In this sense, sex—biological sex—is not the physical mark of gender. Rather, gender is a parallel dimension of sex entailing a network of variations of bodies that challenge the dualism between the natural and the cultural. (2004, 11)
