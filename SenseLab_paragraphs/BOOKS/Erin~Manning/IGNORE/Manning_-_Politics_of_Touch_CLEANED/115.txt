When we tango, I invent space-time with you, a you that is always singular- plural. The room dances. Sometimes I hesitate and cannot move, troubled by my fear of not reaching you, confused in my intermittent discovery that the body I share with you can be heard through my skin. Always a reference to the exile of its displaced roots, tango is burdened by the sadness of the ephemerality of the encounter with an other who must remain other. Yet, tango can also be the deeply satisfying acknowledgment by an other that I have been heard, if only for a moment.
