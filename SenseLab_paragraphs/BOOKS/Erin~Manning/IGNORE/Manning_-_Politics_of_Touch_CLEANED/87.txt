The surface of the body is a thinking, feeling surface. It is a gestural, lin- guistic, sensing skin that protects us while opening us toward and rendering us vulnerable to an other. Our bodies are the bodies without organs of the political, bodies formed and deformed by the division and sharing of commu- nities, of communal and uncommon exchange. Our bodies are resistancesâ€” to ourselves, to each other, resistances to knowledge, to language, to sens- ing, as well as to ignorance, to being touched, to being meaningful, to being there. Touching, our bodies gesture toward each other and themselves, each time challenging and perhaps deforming the body-politic, questioning the boundaries of what it means to touch and be touched, to live together, to live apart, to belong, to communicate, to exclude.
