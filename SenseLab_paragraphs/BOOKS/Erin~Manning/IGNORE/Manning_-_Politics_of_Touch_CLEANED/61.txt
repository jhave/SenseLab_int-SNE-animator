What a body can do depends on the expressions our reachings take. Expression is dynamic, altering the inﬁnite combinations of matter-form, matter-content, form-content. An ethics of expression involves producing “atypical expressions” which constitute “a cutting edge of deterritorializa- tion of language” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 99). To think agrammatically is to “bring out the tensile dimension of language by stretching its elements beyond the limit of their known forms and conventional functions” (Mas- sumi 2002, xxii). Agrammatical thinking brings language to its futurity, to its event-ness, drawing it into the realm of the virtual. The sensing body in movement is an agrammatical invention.
