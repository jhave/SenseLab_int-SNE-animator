Good sense and common sense unite to hold the world to a measure that can purportedly be codiﬁed as a system. Emergence of new ways of thinking are painstakingly kept at bay by the gatekeepers of good and common sense. Yet invariably, expression occurs despite (or even because of) good sense and common sense in an eruption that exceeds the strata of signiﬁcation on which good sense and common sense rely. Sense erupts in the fragility of the moment where surface meets surface and is re-ﬁtted as formed-matter and mattered-form, metastable, passionate, movemented, active. Sense is the effect of corporeal causes and their mixtures, alive with the impossibility of accurately determining the gap between inside and outside, event and problem, sense and making sense. Fragile, expressive.
