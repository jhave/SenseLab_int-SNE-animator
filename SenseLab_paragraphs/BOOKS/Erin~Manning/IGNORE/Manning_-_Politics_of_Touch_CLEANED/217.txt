When I touch you, I confuse the codes of our encounter by altering the space-time between you and me. I also alter something else, a quality difﬁcult to delineate. Touch is ﬁrst and foremost a sensation, a manner of incorporating the world, of embodying the actuality (and virtuality) of an other. Whether I touch my body or yours, I am reaching out toward you beyond a language of comprehension. I cannot predict the effect on my skin, since I cannot know your reaction to my touch and vice versa. This is what makes touch so difﬁcult to embody comprehensively, what makes touch ungrasp- able and indeﬁnable in and of itself. There is no touch that does not reach out. And there are no sign-systems that can completely guarantee that the space I cross to touch you will remain the same after that crossing. Touch is the embodiment of a sense that acquiesces to the unchartable qualities of a body in motion.
