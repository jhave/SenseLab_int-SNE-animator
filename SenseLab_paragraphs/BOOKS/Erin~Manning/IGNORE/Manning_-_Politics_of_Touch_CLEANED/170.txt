What I am seeking here is a friendship that cancels out a certain genealogy that depends on ﬁliation, on fraternity, on national belonging: “to think and live a politics, a friendship, a justice which begin by breaking with their naturalness or their homogeneity, with their alleged place of origin” (Der- rida 1997, 105). As Derrida suggests, “no deconstruction without democ- racy, no democracy without deconstruction” (1997, 105). Wong Kar Wai’s Happy Together could be perceived as this kind of engagement, as a decon- struction of the idea of democracy achieved through the complication of the matters at its core: love, friendship, sexuality, touch, nation. The difﬁcult challenge the ﬁlm embraces is the very open-endedness necessary to think a democracy-to-come that would also be a friendship-to-come. Wong Kar Wai expresses these contradictions through a narrative of desire that ultimately “fails,” if failure is understood here as the undoing of the dreams of the past. There is no happy ending for Lai-Yu Fai and Po-Wing. Yet something else is achieved in this processual space-time of becoming, and this is a certain openness to the challenges of friendship and bodies-in-motion.
