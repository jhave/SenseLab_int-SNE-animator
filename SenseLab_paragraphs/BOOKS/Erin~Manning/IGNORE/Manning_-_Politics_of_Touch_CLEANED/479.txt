Articulation is at stake here, as is disarticulation. A worlding of words make it possible to perceive the ways in which bodies are always already intertwined within their own representations, within their destratiﬁcations, within their sensations, within the worlds they create. Bodies empty them- selves in order to be ﬁlled again. What ﬁlls them, among other things, is sense, sensation. Touch populates the body, prosthetically engaging it to feel differently, to see, to hear, to taste the world again. To reach. For Bodies without Organs to move, intensities must pass along them. They must be produced. Production implies displacement, change, altercation. Bodies with- out Organs are disagreements with/in space and time, challenging at every juncture the constitution of the subject that operates at the basis of politics. Bodies without Organs are not metaphors: they are instantiations of a dif- ferent kind of politics, a different thinking of the body, a patient reaching that reaches toward the BwO’s incessant re-making.
