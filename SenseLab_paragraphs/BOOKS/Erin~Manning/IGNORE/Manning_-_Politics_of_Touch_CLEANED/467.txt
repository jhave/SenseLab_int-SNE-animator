Reaching toward, we are always in the process of making our own BwO. “At any rate you make one, you can’t desire without making one” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 149). This body which awaits me is a body of my own making only to the extent that I move toward the potentiality that is my reaching out toward you.4 It is not an assemblage that I put together, piece by piece. My BwO always differs from its-self: you create it when you space- time with me. “And it awaits you; it is an inevitable exercise or experimen- tation, already accomplished the moment you undertake it, unaccomplished as long as you don’t” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 149). But it is not stable or guaranteed. You can begin to create a BwO only to retreat into your “self,” thereby undermining the process. You can always choose not to touch.
