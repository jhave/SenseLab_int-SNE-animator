A friendship of hearing? Could we conceive of hearing as that which might lead us (if we listen carefully) to a notion of friendship that would circumvent the concept of hearth, of presence, of resemblance, afﬁnity, anal- ogy? Perhaps. An “aneconomic” friendship, to use Derrida’s term (1997, 155). “I hear you!” we might joyously exclaim. “I am listening, ﬁnally.” There is something to this, particularly if we return to tango as an analogy. Touching is always also a listening, a moving away from the economic (oikos) toward a condition of emergence that calls forth an improvisation of body, of movement, of sexuality, of friendship, of the political. Is the listening of which Chang speaks not an opening toward an other, an appealing to an other that calls an other in his or her retreat? I touch you to listen, I listen to you touch, I am in con-tact with you. I cannot touch you without listen- ing to your response, without responding in turn. No touch (haphe, in Greek) without  con-tact.
