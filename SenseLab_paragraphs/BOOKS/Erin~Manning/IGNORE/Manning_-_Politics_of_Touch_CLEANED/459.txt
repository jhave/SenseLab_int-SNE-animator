Tact, like touch, etymologically emerges from the stem tangere, to touch. In its ﬁrst deﬁnition tact is touch. Yet, something has occurred, in time, that has created an uncanny rift between tact and touch: tact is interpreted as a certain prescience that keeps me from touching, from moving toward. As deﬁned in the Oxford English Dictionary, tact is the “ready and delicate sense of what is ﬁtting and proper in dealing with others, so as to avoid giv- ing offence, or win good will; a skill or judgement in dealing with [people] or negotiating difﬁcult or delicate situations; the faculty of saying or doing the right thing at the right time.” Tact is knowing when not to touch.
