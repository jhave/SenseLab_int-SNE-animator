Tango prepares the way for a thinking of the strange instability of bodies. This in turn lays the ground for a thinking of disagreement (Rancière), which emerges in the subsequent chapters. To think politics through disagreement is to resist a consensual model. To disagree (mésentente, in Rancière’s words) is to foreground the process of coming to a decision. To “take” a decision (Derrida’s concept) is what is at stake here. The process of decision-taking involves taking the risk that your decision might change the orientation of an event. Disagreement involves an openness toward this risk, a risk that places into question ﬁlial strategies that restrain politics to hierarchical models with which we are familiar (citizen/sovereign, refugee/citizen, homed/home- less). Disagreement in-forms politics. In-formation, a concept that comes from Simondon, allows us to conceive of information as a process.
