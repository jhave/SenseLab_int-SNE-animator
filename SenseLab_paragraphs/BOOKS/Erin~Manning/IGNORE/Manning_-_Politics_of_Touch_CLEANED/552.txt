The rational modern subject that is at the heart of state sovereignty is a political technology—a posthuman BwO—that implodes the body, drawing its vectors of resonance into collusion with governmental power. Governmentality requires security. Bodies must be contained, maintained. And yet, as Hardt and Negri point out, modern sovereignty cannot be conceived of as a linear, all-encompassing event.
Modernity is divided between a radical revolutionary process and a counter-revolution that seeks to dominate and expropriate the force of emerging movements and dynamics: in the interplay between the plane of immanence, where a consciousness of freedom and scientiﬁc politics opens the way for a democratic politics, and the dominant theme of the Enlightenment, which closes down the movement that characterizes the plane of immanence, we witness the double-bind of sovereign politics today (Hardt and Negri 2000, 74).
