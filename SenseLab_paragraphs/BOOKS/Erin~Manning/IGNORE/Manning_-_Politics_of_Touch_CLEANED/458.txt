Whereas so far a politics of touch has been conceived as a movement that expands the virtual toward potential, it would seem—if we associate touch with con-tact—that touch is also implicated in a movement that is based on an interdiction not to touch. Tact embodies this injunction that challenges me in advance to have known how and when I should or should not touch.
