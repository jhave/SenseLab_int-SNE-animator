Touch is performative in the sense that it exposes the challenges the excessive body (the body in excess of its-self) calls forth within the domain of cultural intelligibility. When I touch you, I re-place both you and myself within the governing system of the body-politic, drawing to our attention the limit-space between your skin, my skin, and the world. This act of engen- dering recasts the matter of bodies as well as their form. This happens through a “force ﬁeld” which is released in the act of reaching-toward that qualitatively alters the space and time in the relation between bodies. This ﬁeld of forces is as concrete as it is virtual. As a practice of relation, touch reaches toward an exposition of matter and form as processual states. When I reach to touch you, I touch not the you who is ﬁxed in space as pre-orchestrated matter/form. I touch the you that you will become in response to my reach- ing toward. Our bodies are at once indissociable and in excess of the regula- tory norms that govern their materialization and the signiﬁcation of these material effects.
