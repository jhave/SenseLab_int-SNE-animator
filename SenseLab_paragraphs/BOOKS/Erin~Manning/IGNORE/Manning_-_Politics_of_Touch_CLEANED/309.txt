Margulis contends that humans have not simply evolved from primates or other mammals, but from a long line of progenitors that can be traced back to the ﬁrst bacteria. Human bodies are composites of thousands of mil- lions of years of interaction among highly responsive microbes. Symbiosis is the term Margulis gives this process of composition.6 Although Margulis’s work has, in large part, been accepted into mainstream molecular biology,7 she admits that “the idea that new species arise from symbiotic mergers among members of old ones is still not even discussed in polite scientiﬁc society” (Margulis 1998, 6).
