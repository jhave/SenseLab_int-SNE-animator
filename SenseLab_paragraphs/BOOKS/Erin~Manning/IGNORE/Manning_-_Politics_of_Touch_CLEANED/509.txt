There is no absolute constraint that can be imposed on the body. The pact is not a death sentence: it is an interruption in the BwO’s nomadic lines of ﬂight. Interruption is a necessary operation. Bodies without Organs would im- plode or explode were there no restrictions to their movements. Accelera- tion demands deceleration. A pact is not an inherently good or bad propo- sition. A pact is a decision, a practice of setting up new velocities and new directionalities. It is a stratiﬁcation, certainly, but it can always lead to new destratiﬁcations, and in most cases, it does just that.
