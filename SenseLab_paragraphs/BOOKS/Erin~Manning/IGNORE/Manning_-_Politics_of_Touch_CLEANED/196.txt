The Bible frames touch as both that which contaminates, “Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty” (Lev. 5:2), and that which heals, “And withersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment and as many as touched him were made whole” (Mark 6:56). In either case, touch represents a certain violence of transformation. Violence, here, is the suggestion not of a tran- scendental category, but of a rupture within humanity as humanity under- stands itself, a rupture that induces at once guilt and healing. For some, it appears, touch is the ultimate gift, for others, the certain demise into the ﬁlth of humanity.
