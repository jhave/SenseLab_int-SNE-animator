The structure or object is formed by at least two bodies, each of which in turn are formed by two or more bodies, to inﬁnity, while in an other direc- tion they are united into every larger and more composite bodies, until one reaches the unique object of Nature in its entirety, an inﬁnitely trans-formable and deformable structure, universal rhythm,... inﬁnite mode. (Deleuze in Montag and Stolze 1997, 25)
