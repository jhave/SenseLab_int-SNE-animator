There are state consequences to a politics of touch. Politics of touch op- erate within an affective-semantic structure quite foreign to nation-state politics. Regulations as to stringent measures of organized difference [man/ woman, citizen/refugee, state/interstate], structures of integration [social models that set up the less privileged as will-less victims], dimensions of be- longing [identity practices] are potentially subverted by a politics of touch. Within a politics of touch, gender exists not as an enduring predicament within a pre-conﬁgured space-time (such as that of the territorial imaginary of the nation-state) where “woman” is too often posited as a docile body that can be located, once and for all.
