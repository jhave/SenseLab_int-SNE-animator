You can never fully escape sense. Even making sense senses. “The highest essences already strive in their existence to make their own encounters cor- respond to relations that are compatible with theirs. This endeavour, which cannot wholly succeed, constitutes the striving of reason” (Deleuze 1990a, 264–65). Controlling space is a way of creating a locus operandi for a pact of reason. This is one of the functions of the state, which seeks reasonable bodies to secure its borders. Bodies without Organs are not eminently rea- sonable. They leak, they expand, they multiply. Hence, within the state apparatus they must be policed, ordered, categorized, ﬁtted to the national body-politic, collapsed into an imaginary that represents the sublation of identity into territory.
