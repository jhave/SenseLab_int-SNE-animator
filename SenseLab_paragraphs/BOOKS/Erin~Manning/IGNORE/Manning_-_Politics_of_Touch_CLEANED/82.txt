To imagine a politics that exceeds a state-centered governmentality necessitates a vocabulary that resists and subverts the language of the state. Of course, language always carries the traces of coercion as much as those of difference. I am not suggesting, therefore, that I can invent a language that will not, always, in some sense, preﬁgure the system of state-sovereignty and its adjacent vocabularies. Nor am I thinking of language strictly in a textual sense. Tango —the infralanguage I use here—makes this palpable: tango is a cultural artefact that both conforms to the notion of state culture through its insistence of its evocation of performing “the” Argentine national identity and subverts this identiﬁcation to the state through its transcultural movements of desire. Argentine tango thus reminds us that transgressions are porous, leaking both into and out of national receptacles. It is in this sense that tango can become a gesture toward a rethinking of a complex notion of the political, a political that will always be tempted to return to the coher- ence imposed and policed by state systems and their adjacent narratives of national  identity.
