Aristotle observes throughout his writings that the most common primary perception is touch. Touch, Aristotle suggests, is necessary to the other senses. The medium that corresponds to touch, according to Aristotle, is the ﬂesh, and the element of touch is the earth. Aristotle somewhat complicates this understanding of touch by suggesting that the organ of touch “must be inside us” (1961, 11, 423b). The invisibility of the organ that represents touch leads Aristotle to ask himself whether touch is one sense or several. For Aristotle, touch is the ﬁrst sense, the one most necessary for the main- tenance of life: “The well-developed sense of touch is the condition of man’s intelligence” (1961, 9). Touch for Aristotle is the sense one cannot live with- out, the sense that human beings have just for the sake of being, whereas other senses, Aristotle suggests, “we have for the sake of well-being” (1961, 13). Touch for Aristotle is the “common sense,” not something above, higher than the separate senses, but their common nature.
