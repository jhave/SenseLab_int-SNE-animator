It used to be so simple. There were ﬁve senses and they created a picture of the world inside your head. But new ways of probing the brain are trans- forming this view of sensory perception. [T]he boundaries between them are being blurred. Maybe you don’t need eyes to “see”—other senses may take over in ways that so far defy explanation. In fact the whole idea that our sensations depend on which sensory organ picks up the information  is being challenged. Deep down, it is what we do that counts.
