While Fai intellectualizes the process, ultimately accepting the “return” home as his way of facing the inevitable loss of the “ideal,” Po-Wing does not suc- cumb either to his dream of the ideal nor to his incessant desire to “start over.” This is not a story of simple beginnings and endings, but a story of multiplicitous yearnings toward love in and across both time and space. It is a story about the incommensurability of Buenos Aires and Hong Kong, of the inevitability of difference in friendship and in love, of the unevenness of translation in and between cultures, of the redundant desire to start things anew. It is a ﬁlm about silences, about the inability to put suffering into words, and about the surprises of friendship with those we might meet along the way never to see them again upon our return to the places we thought of as our beginnings.
