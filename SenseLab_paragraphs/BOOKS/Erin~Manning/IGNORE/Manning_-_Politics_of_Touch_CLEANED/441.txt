Returning sense to signiﬁcation is a common trap associated with theoriza- tions of the political and of democracy. In order to “make sense” of the political, we often demand that it signify within the grids of intelligibility we deﬁne as signiﬁcation. Sense does not operate quite this smoothly, how- ever, as a politics of touch demonstrates. For signiﬁcation to encapsulate sense, it must be ordained within a system of intelligibility that leaves no remainder. This is where signiﬁcation fails again and again. “When we deﬁne signiﬁcation as the condition of truth, we give it a characteristic which it shared with sense, and which is already a characteristic of sense” (Deleuze 1990b, 18). This is the paradox: we want signiﬁcation to make sense and so we turn sense into signiﬁcation. “In discussing the conditions of truth, we raise ourselves above the true and the false, since a false propo- sition also has a sense of signiﬁcation. But at the same time, we deﬁne this superior condition solely as the possibility for the proposition to be true” (1990b, 18).
