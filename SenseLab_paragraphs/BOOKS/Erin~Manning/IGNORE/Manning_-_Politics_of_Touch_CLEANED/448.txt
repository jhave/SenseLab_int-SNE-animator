Signiﬁers attempt to encapsulate entire propositions, including dimensions of signiﬁ- cation, denotation, and manifestation. Politics without essence is a politics that is asignifying, that operates in excess of linguistic signifying systems. Politics has always been about bodies. Bodies have always exceeded signiﬁ- cation. An asignifying politics underscores that political bodies are sensing bodies in movement. These bodies cannot be counted within the means of signifying systems already in place because such systems of sovereign gover- nance refer back, always, to the stratiﬁcation of the grid. Certainly, grids will not disappear, but grids are not the ﬁrst encounter bodies have with sense. Bodies are back-formed onto the grid, they do not emerge from it. Politics works the same way: politics emerges out of the movements of sensing bodies.
