Might we conceive of touch as the original sin? In Genesis 3:3 (all citations from King James Version), God says to Adam and Eve: “But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden... Ye shall not eat neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.” To eat the apple, to be seduced by the snake, these are the obvious sins, the sins that condemn humanity forevermore to exist in a fallen state. But what of touch? Why is touch—the moment of deci- sion—forgotten, cast aside, ignored? Is it not touch, this decision, this responsibility toward fallenness, that in fact condemns Adam and Eve to face the world outside the garden of Eden?
