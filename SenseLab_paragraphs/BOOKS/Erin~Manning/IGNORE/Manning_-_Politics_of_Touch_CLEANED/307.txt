Engenderings are metastable systems. Relation occurs not between already-produced entities or individuals but as an aspect internal to the sys- tem of individuation itself: relation is constitutive of engendering. Engen- derings are bodies in-formation. In-formation does not imply a pre-organized system one superimposes onto matter, but form in a state of disappearance. Being in-formation suggests that form is not a given but a tension between disparate possibilities where becoming precedes Being. This occurs through the process of individuation: as my body engenders, my matter (my energetic potential) is in-formed by a shell that never quite contains the process.
