Po-Wing’s state of dependence marks the end of the sexual relationship between the two men. Lai-Yu Fai makes a point of marking the separation clearly by setting up twin beds. Every time Po-Wing attempts to transgress this new territorial rule, Lai-Yu Fai condemns him, warning him that he will kick him out of the apartment if he misbehaves. Rules become home-bound, spoken in Platonic vocabularies of belonging. Emotions are organized, calculated, speciﬁed, their locations gathered into perimeters that defy rampant and unpredictable desire. Po-Wing’s familiar phrase, “Lai-Yu Fai, we could start over,” uttered once more in the hospital, no longer carries with it the potential of the unknowable for Lai-Yu Fai. He no longer gives in to Po-Wing’s unpredictability, preferring the imposed cadence of being his benefactor. Now, when Po-Wing utters the words, Fai doesn’t even answer. In silence, the camera moves from the end of one bare hallway to the next, capturing them in black and white, at the end of one corridor, sitting side by side, facing nothing and no-one.
