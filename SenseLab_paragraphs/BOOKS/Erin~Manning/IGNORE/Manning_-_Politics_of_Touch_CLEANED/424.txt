Politics of the possible: democratic as a dissonant conjunction of the moment, democracy as differential dissonance, as touch in the making, as movement reaching toward. Democracy, writes Derrida, “is differential; it is différance, renvoi, and spacing” (2005, 38). Democracy as a politics of touch does not simply defer and differ from itself. It individuates. Democracy transduces—forms matter and matters form—by spacing its movements in excess of “its-self,” by mattering without being equal to its form. Democracy is no safe haven: to touch you I risk that you will not want to create a timed- space with me, I risk your absence, I risk your failure to individuate, I risk my own fear of your difference, of my deferral. Democracy, in this sense, is always virtual, it is a touching that has not yet touched, that has not yet been touched, that is continually in the process of initiating a movement toward a touch that may or may not lead to a spacing through which I will con- tinue my process of individuation.
