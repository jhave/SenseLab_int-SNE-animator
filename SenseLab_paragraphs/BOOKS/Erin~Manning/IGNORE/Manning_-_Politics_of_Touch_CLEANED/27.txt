The body at work in Politics of Touch is a sensing body in movement. This is not a “new” body (though it always networks in new and diverging ways). It is a body that has always emerged through and alongside other bodies, be they political bodies, gendered bodies, raced bodies. What is “new” about the body foregrounded in Politics of Touch is not its shape or form but the rela- tional matrices it makes possible.
In Politics of Touch, the exploration of touch is an interdisciplinary endeavor that depends on striking new relations between terms, subjects, and ideas. Politics of Touch begins with an exploration of how touch works.
