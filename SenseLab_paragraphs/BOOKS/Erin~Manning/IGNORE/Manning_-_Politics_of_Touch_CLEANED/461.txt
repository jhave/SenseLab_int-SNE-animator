Tact is anathema to a politics of touch, but never wholly disjointed from it. Touch is always at risk of being tactically re-secured. Tact abides within the conditions of possibility of touch. To circumvent tact, touch resolves to reach beyond tact, beyond the unspoken judgment that urges me to refrain from touching. To touch entails acknowledging the risks associated with the unknown toward whom I reach when I touch. Touch must always lead beyond where I anticipated it would. Tact, on the other hand, keeps me in the realm of the almost-known, the anticipated-in-advance. In this regard, tact holds to a structure of habit that discourages invention. To be tact-ful is to claim to know in advance. Tact-fully, I reinscribe my movements within a certain structure of sedimented propriety. Even though incorporeal (tact is based on a virtual necessity rather than a spoken judgment), tact has the full capacity to be gridded. Touch, on the other hand, emerges from a diver- gent version of incorporeality: I touch always toward that which has not yet been decided. I cannot back-grid the future anterior.
