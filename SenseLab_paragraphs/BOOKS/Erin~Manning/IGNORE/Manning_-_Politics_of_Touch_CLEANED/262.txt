Yet, in many ways, the sensing body is anathema to the national body- politic, to its politics of consensus, to its violent politics of exclusion. “I am   the continuous, necessary overcoming of myself,” writes Nietzsche, “. . . noth- ing but struggle and becoming and purpose and contradiction of purposes” (1969, 3:271). We are our body, and we are the spaces we create and em- body as we reach-toward. We are the embodiment of homesickness that at- tests to the fact that ultimate stability (consensus) is impossible. To live, we touch, or conversely, to stop touching is to die, to deprive ourselves of a body. Tactility is fraught with an ambiguity we cannot resolve. This ambi- guity, this complex worlding, is perhaps the most difﬁcult thing to sustain over time. This is the founding paradox of the national body-politic.
