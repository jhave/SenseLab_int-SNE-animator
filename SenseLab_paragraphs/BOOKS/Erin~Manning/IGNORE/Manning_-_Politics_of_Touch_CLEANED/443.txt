The senses supplement sense: external and internal to sense-as-signiﬁcation, the senses extend what it is to “know,” challenging implicitly the manner in which the conditioning of sense continues to be allocated to a strict econ- omy of reason as extrinsic from the body. Sense, sensing, senses, making sense, making senses supplement signiﬁcation by rendering it bodily, by adding to the body, by extending the capacity to know into a sensual appa- ratus. Signiﬁcation is sensual, it turns out, and politics make sense.
