Parts of Urizen’s body grow out of themselves. Eyes shoot out from the brain; ears spiral from the orbs of vision. The senses escape the common organization of the body even as they transform it, ﬂuidly reconnecting to bodies spaced and timed elsewhere. The body is shackled, but even so, the senses defy organization. Tristanne Connolly writes: “Blake’s descriptions of the metamorphosis of the sense organs make it clear that the body we know is the result of the transformation” (2002b, 78). When the inhabitants of Urizen’s world endure changes, their senses also change: “their eyes / Grew small like the eyes of man” (23:35–36). Space and time are qualitatively altered alongside shifts in the dimensions of the senses. “The sense organs seem to metamorphose swiftly, but each change occurs as an age passes over” (Connolly 2002b, 89).
