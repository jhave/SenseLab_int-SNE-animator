According to Spinoza, a body (however miniscule) is composed of an inﬁnity of particles that express themselves through modulations of rest and movement. Movement and rest categorize the body’s incessant movements-toward. Bodies affect other bodies. Expression happens in the in-between of bodies. Individuation takes place in these intervals. Bodies are not deﬁned through functions but through modalities. Forms or functions are replaced by effects of slowness or speed and their interrelation. “Even the develop- ment of a form, the course of the developing of a form, depends on these relations, not the reverse” (Deleuze 1988b, 123). What is important is to conceptualize—to express—life, individuation, not as form but as a com- plex interchange between differential speeds.
