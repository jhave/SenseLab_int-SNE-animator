If Fai’s caretaking was an attempt to domesticate Po-Wing, it goes terribly wrong. This is apparent is Po-Wing’s ultimate escape to the night world as well as in Po-Wing’s response to Fai when Fai himself gets sick. Po-Wing does not want to be the caregiver. Certainly desire can survive and even ﬂourish in a caring relationship, but when caregiving forgets reciprocity to instill a hierarchy of power, desire is left by the wayside: desire wants noth- ing to do with hierarchies of consumption and dependence. Hence, we are increasingly faced with a relationship between Fai and Po-Wing in which the asymmetry of desire and caretaking never quite allows them to come together. As Wong Kar Wai demonstrates, desire is slippery and is perhaps most challenged in situations of need and loss of footing. When Po-Wing is sick he seeks care through desire, and when Fai is sick, he seeks desire through care. A stinging example of this dynamic takes place when Fai lies shivering and sick in bed and Po-Wing complains that he hasn’t eaten in two days and asks Fai to prepare some food. “Are you cold-blooded or what, asking a sick man to cook for you!” exclaims Fai as he gets up to serve Po-Wing.
