Desire cannot be captured, domesticated, housed, mortgaged, or nationalized. Desire does not belong to the state or to state-sanctioned practices. Desire, like touch, is a point of indistinction, an intransigent momentary reaching toward that is in excess of both violence and the law, even while it potentially reconstitutes them. “Desire is desire for the absolutely other” (Levinas 1969, 34). Desire is movement, it is the body in movement. How can there be movement without desire, when every desire implies a moving toward and any movement implies a desire to move? Desire is the potential toward positionality, if positionality is conceived as temporary, for desire never becomes encapsulated in a gridlock without losing its emergence. There is no desire that survives the grid. Desire is the unreachable in the effort to reach toward. Desire is the movement of intransigence necessary to the continuation of any movement, of all movements, and hence of all poli- tics and all touch. A politics of touch is at once a politics of movement and a politics of desire. A politics of friendship, in turn, is a politics of touching desire in movement. Love, perhaps, is the extreme form of this kind of politics.
