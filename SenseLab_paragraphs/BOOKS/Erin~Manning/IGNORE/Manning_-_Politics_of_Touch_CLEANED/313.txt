Form suggests an organizational shift in the system. When matter is po- tentialized into a given form, a phase shift occurs. This phase shift dephases the body-as-identity, exposing the body to the effects of its reaching toward: the body becomes the multiplicity of its becoming and its having-become. Bodies are as incorporeal as they are in-formed. By incorporeal I do not mean less real. On the contrary: the body becomes more than real, more than its envelope, more than the space-time of its pre-locatedness. It is in this sense that engenderings are “machinic”:9 engenderings entail the merg- ing of different bodies of production. The body is machinic in the sense that it is plural and unpredictable, evolving always through movements that are contingent on environments  and  (re)combinations.  The  dissolution and symbiosis of forms and functions is a necessary and integral part of any concept of creative evolution. Production comes into contact with repro- duction through the machinic assemblage that connects a body to biophysi- cal, biocultural, and biodigital organizations of sex. Engenderings are not stable renderings of bodies-as-machines. Engenderings call forth bodies, inciting them to recombine.
