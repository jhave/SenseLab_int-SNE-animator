Although the senses are often described individually in Blake’s poems, they are synesthetically joined in the body’s passionate participation in experience. They are not passive. The senses move the body toward a world that expands exponentially given the opportunity to work supplementarily in deﬁance of the dichotomies dictated by a biblical text that continues to preach the primary difference between good and evil. Passivity brings forth shrink- age of the senses as they attempt to constrain themselves to the individual body. In passivity senses are reduced, all but touch, which “is capable of rousing the greatest ecstasy [and] admits man into Eternity; therefore it is not ‘dead,’ like an other senses, but only cursed” (Damon 1971, 408; in Vinge 1975).
