According to Gil, “Exfoliation is the essential way a body ‘turns onto’ things, onto objective space, onto living things” (1998, 21). Touch might be considered one method of exfoliating the body, since touch crosses space via the body, creating a becoming-body while establishing diverse relations with all that surrounds our bodies. The desire to cross space—to touch an other — is a desire in movement as well as a movement of desire. This invest- ment of desire resigniﬁes the space that separates me from you, awakening my body to the different sensations your body evokes in me. Together, we manifest new sensations as touch expands to an inﬁnity of combinations of skin upon skin, body toward body. This connection of touch that traverses time and space establishes a relation that in turn affects the form and space of all bodies including the “body-politic,” inviting the body as embodiment of a diverging chronotope to become other to that of the nation-state’s soli- tary spaces of conﬁnement.
