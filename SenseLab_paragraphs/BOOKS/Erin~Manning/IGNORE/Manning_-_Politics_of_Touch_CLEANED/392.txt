The relation of law to time is invested in the imaginary of politics and its futures. If time is not goal directed, outcomes cannot be classiﬁed in the same way, and laws cannot be written in stone. Judgment and law are here juxtaposed. The suggestion is that law operates in the virtual because it always remains to be rewritten. This paradox (since law seems like the most staid of events) betrays the complex time lines already operative within political systems. Beardsworth suggests that “all inventions can only be ‘recognized’ after the event, and the history of their exclusions always already haunt the ‘present’ of the act of invention” (1996, 99). To recognize is to re-cognize, to take into consideration again. Inventing new imagi- naries depends on re-inventing both our investment in time and our invest- ment in the law. By thinking the law according to the logic of the aporia, and by locating the porous skins of our intermingled and overlapping bodies (be they singular or multiple) as potential embodiments of the aporia, we can begin to appreciate the manner in which law has always been predi- cated on a certain delay of time rather than on the ﬁxity of time. The vio- lence of the law depends on legislation coming either too early or too late. There is no presence of the law.
