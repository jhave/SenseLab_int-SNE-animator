Derrida writes: “Of democracy there could only be but a trace” (2005, 39). The liberty at the heart of democracy is a liberty that invites me to move alongside the trace that democracy embodies. There is no predetermination here. The trace emerges, it propulses, it creates, but it does not deﬁne or substantiate. Democracy is the liberty to appreciate the trace.
