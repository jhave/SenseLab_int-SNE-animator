Although tango could be introduced as the ultimate signiﬁer of Argentine national identity, I do not approach tango from this vantage point, preferring instead to locate tango as a transnational crossing of human and political boundaries, as a politics of touch that displaces all notions of seden- tary encounters with an other. For me, tango is a movement across time and space, an errant politics1 that calls out to the night-world to re-orchestrate its systems of governance and exchange through bodies that exist not, ﬁrst and foremost, for the outside world, but for the inner exchange between two silent partners, moving quietly, eyes half closed, toward dawn.
