In response to his loneliness, Fai places a call to his father in Hong Kong, but the call does not go well. It seems his father has nothing to say. Fai is even further away from “home” than he thought. Lai-Yu Fai ﬁnally decides to assume his responsibility in his conﬂictual lure toward “home” and begins to write. This is a moment of initiative, a moment of con-tact that permits Fai to face the nostalgia he associates with “home.” Yet, it quickly becomes apparent that he is not ready to allow “home” to become a transitive space rather than an intransigent locus of belonging. “Today is my day off,” he says in the voice-over. “I want to send Father a Christmas card but it turns into a long letter. At home I didn’t talk to him, now I want to tell him many things. I hope he’ll give me a chance to start over.” This time it is Fai who wants to start over. He doesn’t seem to see the irony. In a following scene, when Po-Wing asks him over the phone to return his pass- port, Lai-Yu Fai responds in a voice-over: “I don’t mind returning it. But I won’t face him. I know what he’ll say if I see him.” Later, unable to sleep, Lai-Yu Fai imagines Hong Kong upside down.
