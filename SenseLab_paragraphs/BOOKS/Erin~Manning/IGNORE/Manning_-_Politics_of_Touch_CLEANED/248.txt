The social fracture that ensues in response to a politics of touch is a ﬂoating dispersion of the center. Sites of disavowal and disownership, of belonging and abandonment appear in the most unexpected places. Space is rewritten, re-sensed, only to be altered again. Within this shifting net- work of movements of desire, political agency is transformed into a political subjectivity-in-process, which takes decisions and makes demands. These demands exceed the grids of intelligibility that would otherwise contain them. Their violence is breath-taking. It is here that the political body re-emerges: “It comes into view as a mise-en-scène with its own genealogy of domination and resistance” (Feldman 1991, 6). This body is touched by the world even as it reaches out toward it. It is a politicized body that real- izes that there is no story of movement that does not do a certain violence to the space it traverses. Violence can be horrendous. But the body is political only when it can both receive and disseminate violence, touch, alterity. “The body, altered by violence, re-enacts other altered bodies dispersed in time and space; it also re-enacts political discourse and even the movement of history itself” (Feldman 1991, 7).
