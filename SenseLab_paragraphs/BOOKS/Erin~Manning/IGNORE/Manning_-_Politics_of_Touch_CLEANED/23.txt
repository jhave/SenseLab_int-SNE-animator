In Politics of Touch, I explore the ways in which research on the senses can extend beyond commonsense approaches to the senses and to the body. To write about the senses it is necessary to write against the grain of a mind- body, reason-senses model that continues to privilege staid readings of gen- der, biology, and politics. To write against the grain is to become sensitive, at all junctures, to how the body is deﬁned, composed, and compartmental- ized. This challenge becomes palpable when we return to Meany’s work: despite the fact that his work explicitly attempts to rethink the sensory system and its biological effects, presuppositions as regards the (gendered) body undergird his arguments. It is in part because Meany does not question how touch works that his ﬁndings are not yet capable of extending beyond commonsense notions of touch. The challenge when working with the senses is to not presuppose that we already know what it means to sense.
That mothers can alter the experience of their young by touching them is not something I dispute. What I counter is the notion that the senses are controlled by one body and given to another or withheld. This attitude posits as its point of departure a stable body that exists in a pre-given space-time which contains an active giver and a passive receptor. Politics of Touch challenges this assumption, positioning the senses relationally as expressions of moving bodies. This presupposes a vastly altered concept of time and space. Whereas in the active-passive commonsense model, time and space are located as stable signiﬁers into which the body enters, within a relational model, space and time are qualitatively transformed by the movements of the body. The body does not move into space and time, it creates space and time: there is no space and time before movement.
