The national body-politic normalizes gender so as to relegate the gendered body to speciﬁc sites within the nation’s domestic chronotope. The intelligibility of the gendered body becomes dependent on its representa- tion within the captivity of what the discourse of the nation considers to be the “norm.” Traditionally, the political public space (the nation) is deﬁned through the presence of men and contrasted to the apolitical, private space— the home—of women. As a consequence, disenfranchised groups, such as women, often feel they have no other choice but to turn to the nation or to national values to register their claims as political, this despite the fact that turning to the nation’s normative political systems usually reproduces the very same normative genderings.
