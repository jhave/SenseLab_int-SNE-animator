The Garden of Love
I went to the Garden of Love, And saw what I never had seen: A Chapel was built in the midst.
Where I used to play on the green.
And the gates of this Chapel were shut, And Thou shalt not writ over the door; So I turn’d to the Garden of Love,   That so many sweet ﬂowers bore,
And I saw it was ﬁlled with the graves, And tombstones where ﬂowers should be:
And Priests in black gowns, were walking their rounds,
And binding with briars, my joys & desires. (Blake 1979, 51)
