Touch is intimately linked to the skin. The skin that touches and is touched is continually rebuilding itself from the outer to the innermost lay- ers. To reach toward skin through touch is to reach toward that which is in a continued state of (dis)integration and (dis)appearance. Skin gives us a clue to the untouchability of the body. If we locate skin as the receptor that never quite remains its-self, we can begin to appreciate the ways in which touch can never be more than a reaching-toward the untouchable. In addi- tion to its regenerative qualities, there is also the issue of forgetting: if we want touch to last, we must touch again, lest the skin “forget” the touch we can feel but momentarily. When we reach toward to touch, we reach toward that which is in-formation or trans-formation. This reaching-toward is an engendering that qualitatively alters the relation between being and be- coming, alerting us to the potential variables that combine to give us a clue as to “what a body can do.”
