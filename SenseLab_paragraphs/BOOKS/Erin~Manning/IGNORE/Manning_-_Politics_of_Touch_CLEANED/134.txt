This continuity of movement subverts any idea of a stable body, be it a body-politic or a fraternity, be it a national or a sexual identity. This conti- nuity of movement produces, rather, a multiplication of space-times created in and by the bodies in movement, enabling a desire to keep reaching toward not measure, divided in the crossing, but toward a rhythmic multiplication of space-times. Any positionality in this process is not a stopping but a quality of the movement: the body never stops (desiring). The body moves toward desire as the friend reaches toward an other, this with the knowledge that I am always reaching toward the horizons of my death, of the death of our friendship. The friendship must always start anew, otherwise it is not a friend- ship but an imprisonment of the self as self-same. In a politics of friendship I cannot distinguish between self and other, I cannot position myself as the self-same: within this politics there is no other movement than the com- plexly reciprocal movement toward one-another, a movement that leads us in multiple directions, not always to an other toward whom I thought I was reaching. Friendship is political, in these instances, because it is multidirec- tional, because it does not decide in advance whom and how to touch.
