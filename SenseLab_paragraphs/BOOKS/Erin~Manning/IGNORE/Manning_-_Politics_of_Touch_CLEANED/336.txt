The “individuals” handled as unities in the population equations are them- selves symbiotic complexes involving uncounted numbers of live entities integrated in diverse ways in an unstudied fashion. In representations of standard evolutionary theory, branches on “family trees” (phylogenies) are allowed only to bifurcate. Yet symbiosis analyses reveal that branches on evolutionary trees are mushy and must anastomose; indeed, every eukaryote, like every lichen, has more than a single type of ancestor. Such analyses also reveal rampant polyphyly (e.g., more than eight independent origins of parasitism in dicotyledonous plants . . .). The fact that “individuals”—as the countable unities of population genetics—do not exist wreaks havoc with “cladistics,” a science in which common ancestors of composite beings are supposedly rigorously determined. Failure to acknowledge the composite nature of the organisms studied invalidates entire “ﬁelds” of study. (1991, 10)
