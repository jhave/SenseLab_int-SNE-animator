A deconstruction of the political suggests that judgment as such is impos- sible. Judgment is impossible insofar as judgment must take place in a pre- speciﬁed organization of time and space (and there is, ultimately, no such time and space). It is for this reason that we must not confuse judgment, justice, and the law. While the law is always written with the option of a rewriting, thereby at least offering the potential of justice, judgment fore- closes this very opening by stopping time. Judgment is opposed to my re- sponse: it wants to have the ﬁnal word. A politics of touch in the guise of a democracy-to-come foregrounds response-ability. I respond to you always toward a present that is not yet with the promise to respond again. Touch is never a single gesture. Response-ability is a radical understanding of the future anterior.
