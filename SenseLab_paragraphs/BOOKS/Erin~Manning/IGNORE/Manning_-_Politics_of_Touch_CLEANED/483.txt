Sense-events are real but abstract. Actual but virtual. Virtual because my body remains that which it never always already is. Virtual because the senses resist stratiﬁcation within a stable conﬁguration, responsive primarily to that which is not-yet. I touch that which I am not-yet touching. What I touch is not the object itself, but the potential of the object to be touched. I touch my capacity to emerge through the object. I touch my experience of reaching-toward. “The problem is that if the body were all and only in the present, it could be all and only what it is. Nothing is all and only what it is. A body present is in dissolve: out of what it is just ceasing to be, into what it will already have become by the time it registers that something has hap- pened” (Massumi 2002a, 200). A politics of touch activates this transition, this moving through the present where past and future are in nonlinear continuity with one-another. “A body does not coincide with its present. It coincides with its potential. The potential is the future-past contemporary with every body’s change” (Massumi 2002a, 200).
