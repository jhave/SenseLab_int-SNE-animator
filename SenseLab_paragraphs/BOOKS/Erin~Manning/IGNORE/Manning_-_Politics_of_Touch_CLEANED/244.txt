Yet even within the state model, the body remains an agent of juxtaposition and transformation, for the body can never be completely incorporated within the semantics of the nation-state and its body-politic. Situated practices alter the body as the body alters these very practices. Allen Feldman writes: “The cultural construction of the political subject is tied to the cultural construction of history. This intersection results in political agency as an embodied force” (1991, 2). Political agency here is achieved not as a given but on the basis of a practice that alters the body: political agency is conceived of as an effect of situated practices. This view of political agency is supported by Nietzsche’s concept of work, where agency is understood not as the state of the political body itself, but as the product of that body’s work. It is important to hold to this supplemental relation of the passive and the active body in order not to fall prey to the mythologizing renditions of a body-in-process that focus not on the movements themselves but on the mythos of a stable, coherent body: there is a need to interrogate the mythicizing reception of violence in order to trace the path by which ideological readings of violence engender the sub- ject of the act and the extrinsic site of legitimation in a single movement.
