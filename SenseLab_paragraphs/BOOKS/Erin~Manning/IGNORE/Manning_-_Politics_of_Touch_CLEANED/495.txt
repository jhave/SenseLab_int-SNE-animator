Affection is therefore not only the instantaneous effect of a body upon my own, but also has an effect on my own duration, a pleasure or pain, a joy or sadness. These are passages, becomings, rises and falls, continuous variations of power (puissance) that pass from one state to another. (Deleuze in Montag and Stolze 1997, 22)
Affects are variations of power (puissance). Affects call forth mixtures through chance, accident, confusion. Bodies without Organs meet in sur- prising ways. To reach out and touch is to touch not only the untouchable but the inconceivable. There are no causal linkages between Bodies without Organs. Affects do not organize the body. They play on the surfaces. They are surface-events that expose not the organism but its movements. “We know bodies only through the shadow they cast upon us, and it is through our own shadow that we know ourselves, ourselves and our bodies” (Deleuze in Montag and Stolze 1997, 24). Affects collude. Collide.
