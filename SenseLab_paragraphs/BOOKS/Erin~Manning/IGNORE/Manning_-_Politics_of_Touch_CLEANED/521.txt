Power, puissance, potentia: these frame politics at its most complex. Politics of touch reposition standard understandings of state politics by having no system of reference for a concept such as individual power. Without an individual, a body cannot be secured. Enclosures—conceptual or physi- cal—require a hierarchy of dominance, which in turn requires a given body. If the body is no longer given but produced, it cannot be held to a system of governance that knows in advance how to tactically restrain its citizens.
