The plane of immanence is not composed of a supplementarity that would precede or exceed it. Bodies on the plane of immanence are what they become in a now that is eternally recurrent. There is no subject here, only affective states individuating, force-fully. Bodies without Organs express their multiplicity on this plane in the relation between rest and movement, in the creation of intensities that draw space and time into new conÔ¨Ågura- tions for the invitation of other bodies, other movements. Touch operates politically as that which instantiates connections, however brief.
