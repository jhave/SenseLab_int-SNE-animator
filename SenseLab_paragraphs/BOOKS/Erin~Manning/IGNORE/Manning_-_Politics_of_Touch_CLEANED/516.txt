The issue for Spinoza is how modes are activated: “Can they attain active affections, and how?” (Deleuze 1990a, 219). For Spinoza, this is the ethical question. As I mentioned before, there are no good or bad modes. Deleuze explains:
But, even supposing that a mode manages to produce active affections, while it exists it cannot eliminate all its passions, but can at best bring it about that its passions occupy only a small part of itself.... [T]he affections of modes  are as it were a second degree of affection, affections of affections: for ex- ample. A passive affection that we experience is just the effect of some body on your own. The idea of such an affection does not express its cause, that is to say, the nature or essence of the external body: rather does it indelicate the present constitution of our own body, and so the way in which our capacity to be affected is being at that moment exercised. An affection of  our body is only a corporeal image, and the idea of the affection as it is in our mind is an inadequate idea, an imagining. And we have yet another sort of affection. From a given idea of an affection there necessarily ﬂow affects  of feelings (affectus). Such feelings are themselves affections, or rather a new kind of idea of an affection.... (Deleuze 1990a, 220)
