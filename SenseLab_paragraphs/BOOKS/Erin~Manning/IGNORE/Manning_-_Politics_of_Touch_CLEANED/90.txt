Offering my-self is always possible. It is a potentiality that can never be conﬁrmed as a ﬁnite act, for there is no offering that is indelible, which takes place without remainder, without return. I offer my body and, in doing so, I open ourselves to receive. Within this relation, new bodies are engendered and shared, bodies of thought, bodies of knowledge. Sense, my sense of your difference, the sensation I experience when I touch your skin, this sense makes sense to me only insofar as it creates a body of work, a growing expe- rience of what it means to receive the gift of touch. Touching you, I begin to write a corpus that deﬁes the Aristotelian polis. This corpus tells a story, plural but not like-minded, of bodies reaching out toward one another, a story of the separation and sharing of bodies, of the transposition of the being-body, multiple, always in excess of its-self, excribed within a corpus I can never quite articulate.
