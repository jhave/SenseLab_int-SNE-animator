2. For Lucretius (99 B.C.–55 B.C.), the senses reside in the body as separate from the mind, and sense-perception is dependent on sense-organs. His contention is that when the body dies, it loses its sense-organs, and therefore the senses are linked to the body’s life source. Inﬂuenced by Aristotelian (384 B.C.–322 B.C.) thought, Lucretius does not treat touch as a separate sense, but understands touch to be a condition of the other four senses. Interestingly, despite locating the senses solely in the body, Lucretius does suggest that the senses are a condition for intellec- tual life (Vinge 1975, 31): body and mind are momentarily united by the senses even as they remain categorized as separate realms.
Philo (20 B.C.–A.D. 40) reads Genesis’s Adam as mind, and Eve as the senses. This leads Philo to surmise that the senses are responsible for the enslaving allure- ment of the objects that surround our bodies. The sensory mechanisms are victims of the environment: beauty enslaves sight, good food enslaves taste. Only reason-as- mind can come to the rescue (often conceived through the sense of vision): “Mind is superior to sense-perception,” he writes (Legum Allegoriae III 452 f). The mind here is compared to the governor of a city and the senses allegorized through the image of a loss of control of this secured space. If the senses are given too much power, Philo suggests, the same confusion will arise as in a house where the slaves take over. Kept at bay (in the body of the woman, for instance) the senses can be faithful guardians, keeping us to the straight and narrow.
To Cicero (106 B.C.–43 B.C.), “the soul or the mind has an existence of its own inside the ﬁve senses, which are not in themselves able to conceive anything” (Vinge
