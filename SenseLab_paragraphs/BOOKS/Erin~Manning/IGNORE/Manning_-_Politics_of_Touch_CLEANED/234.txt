The internal vocation of state politics is the uniﬁcation of aims and the organization of these aspirations into a unique spatiotemporal whole. State politics does not happily suffer tears in its social fabric: politics must be common, and where commonality cannot be located, a line must be drawn to create a ﬁssure between the inside and the outside, between the known and the unknown, the self and the other. This uniﬁcation of forces for the “common good” condones domination in the name of a re-balancing of social relations. Each body must be put in its place. The placing of the body is necessary in order for the distribution of power to adequately inscribe the social order within its own grids of intelligibility. The body becomes intelli- gible insofar as it becomes common. Intelligibility as commonality is the pri- mary political articulation within the language of the nation-state.
