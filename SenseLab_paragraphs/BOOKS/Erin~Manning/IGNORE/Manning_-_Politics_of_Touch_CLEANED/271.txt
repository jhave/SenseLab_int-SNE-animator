Jesus exposes himself in relation (to Mary, to Thomas, to God) on a positive logic of ema- nation. Materiality is intensiﬁed. Your touch goes right through me because there is no “me.” I am not eternal, I am eternally material. Material, I am the metamorphosing body, exposing my-selves to you, to your touch that never quite adheres, that never quite reaches the one I am not yet, the one I will never quite become. “Flesh is the condition of possibility of the qual- ities of the world, but it is never contained within or deﬁned by those quali- ties. In this sense it is both a superﬁcial foundation and an immanent tran- scendence—alien to any dialectic of reality and appearance, or depth and surface” (Hardt 2002, 83).
