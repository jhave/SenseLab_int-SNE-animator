Pace becomes political when we begin to think time as a movement not in one direction but as a reaching toward that is rhizomatic. In Derrida’s terms, we would then be thinking time as aporia.5 The aporia refers here to the “‘impossible’ relation between the passage of time and political organi- zation” (Beardsworth 1996, xiii). Derrida suggests that philosophy’s tradi- tional disavowal of time is already political and therefore carries political consequences. Metaphysical logic translates time into presence rather than attending to its irreducibility. According to Beardsworth, “[j]udgements and inventions which have endured this experience have greater chance of rec- ognizing difference according to the lesser violence” (1996, 101). When the time of the present as presence (the knowable) is challenged by the time of the future anterior (the unknowable or that beyond reach), inventions are born. The best inventions are the impossible ones.
