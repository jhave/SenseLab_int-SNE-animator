The space that is the body is not a stable, continuous space. It is a space hardened by lack of contact, awakened by the surprise of touch, a space alive with the incompleteness of its spacing (espacement). The body is a space and touch is its articulation. Touch articulates the body, giving it a language through which it can begin to feel the world. The skin is a limit for touch, yet this limit is as ﬁnite and as inﬁnite as the multiplicity of skins that make up the world. Touch embodies difference: through touch I ascertain the dif- ference between bodies and surfaces. This espacement that marks the differ- ence between spaces introduces my body to a becoming-space of time and a becoming-time of space. This becoming is the constitution of a subjectivity that is in movement, a subjectiﬁcation that is formed within the tactile hollows of difference.
