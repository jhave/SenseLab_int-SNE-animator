A new concept of population emerges when fully determinate and dis- crete units are no longer operative as the precursors of an evolutionary model that relies on self-contained genetic units along pre-formed evolu- tionary linkages. As Ansell Pearson writes: “On the Weismannian17 model, evolution is reduced to a predetermined genetic programme proceeding via the elimination and extermination of the unﬁt. But such a notion of evolu- tion is bound up with a particular conception of individuals as determinate and discrete, functioning as closed systems” (1999, 167). When evolution is used as a calculational process, individuals become the impetus for survival. Genes become the immortal actors in the ﬁght for continuity. Bodies are conceptualized according to strict codes of conduct (Rayner 1997, 70). This results in classiﬁcatory differences that are embedded in certain ideologies that already consider certain kinds of reproduction or survival to be of utmost consequence. Creative becoming is not at stake here. What is at stake is a continued re-instantiation of roles of speciation, including those of sex and gender.
