Sensing bodies might be thought of as posthuman bodies. To be posthu- man is not to be more or less human, nor is it to become a different kind of human. Posthumanity is simply another way of referring to the bodyâ€™s orig- inary technicity and its prosthetic nature. Endosymbiotically, biology points toward the complexities of bodies in relation. Biologically, even, the body is always less than what it can and will become and more than what we can imagine or foresee. A body that is open to its processes of individuation is a posthuman body. Post: will-have been. To think of the posthuman body is to open oneself to a body-thinking that exceeds the realm of the national body-politic. It is to begin to engage creatively with what a body can do.
