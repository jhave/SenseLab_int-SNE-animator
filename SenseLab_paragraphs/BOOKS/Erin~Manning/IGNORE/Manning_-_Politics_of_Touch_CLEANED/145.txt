This touch is, in Massumi’s words, a “miraculation.” It is a sensation that “presents a directly disjunctive coinciding” doubled, always, by an other’s sen- sation (2002a, 13). This movement with and toward an other is a doubling that does not assume my singularity but incorporates it to create an other body. Touch cannot take over my singularity (because my singularity is always more-than one): this protects touch from assimilation or exoticization. In reciprocity—in movement—singularities proliferate. The multiplication of sensation that occurs in this movement of relation refutes strict measure: bodies are always more than one. Bodies fall apart as they fall together, in the interval. “Resonation [is] not on the walls [but] in the emptiness between them” (Massumi 2002a, 14). Bodies in touch resonate, caressing the full- nesses in-between, creating not distance or closeness but movement toward, always toward. This complex dynamic is an event that “remains in continu- ity with itself across it multiplication” (Massumi 2002a, 14).
