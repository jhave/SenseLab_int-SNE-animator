With my dance shoes on my feet, I begin to look around. I am looking for a woman. Today I am wearing my ﬂat shoes. My long dress almost con- ceals my feet. Perhaps later I will change into my heels. But for the moment, I want to lead. The music changes. Tango waltz drifts over the ﬂoor from the speakers. The ﬂoor ﬁlls quickly: the lyrical 1-2-3 beat is popular. I see a woman across the room adjusting her shoes. I move toward her and ask her to dance. She smiles as I lead her onto the dance ﬂoor. She was expecting a man.
