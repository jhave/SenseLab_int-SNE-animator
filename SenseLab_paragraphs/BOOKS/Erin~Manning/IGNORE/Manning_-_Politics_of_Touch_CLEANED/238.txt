Certainly violence remains deadly, but in this case the violence is not held exclusively by the state. Now the violence can be envisioned as a net- work of forces that produces effects of power and knowledge with which the body can work. Whereas within the system of state sovereignty infractions remain crimes against the state, the body that challenges the conﬁnes of state sovereignty shares in the potential for violence and therefore conceives of violence not as a moment of an external “be-falling” but as a moment of response-ability. This is an important shift, for when violence is the exclu- sive right of the state, everyone becomes guilty of being guilty, whereas when violence is a shared enterprise between bodies through the complex modality of touch, violence becomes the measure of a response in the tak- ing of a decision which involves a response-ability not only toward an other but also toward myself.
