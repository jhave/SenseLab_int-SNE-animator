The moment of touch as reaching-toward is a rare moment when the political and the ethical exist side by side. It is rare not only because it happens seldom, but also because it is haphazard, momentary, ephemeral. It is an ethico-politics in deconstruction that brieﬂy resists security, stability, classiﬁcation. This ethico-politics, violent as it may be (since it is always the result of “taking” a decision), releases us momentarily from the border- making dynamic of the state apparatus that, if it were to contend with touch as a means of codifying the body-politic, would make an attempt to imprison this newly created third space within its grids of intelligibility. It is this ethico-politics that I am attempting to put my ﬁnger on, an ethico-politics that is, by necessity, always slightly out of reach.
