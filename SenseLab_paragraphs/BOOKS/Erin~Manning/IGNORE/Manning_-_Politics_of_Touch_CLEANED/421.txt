Liberty, as I conceive it here, is about sense, about making sense incommen- surably, about sensing beyond a politics of individuals toward a politics of individuation. Being free entails subverting the overdetermined conjunction between sensing and knowing that captures space-time in an effort to locate a ﬁnite body. To be free is to take time for a thought that is not already cir- cumscribed within simple location. The time for liberty—the time of democracy, of touch—is always deferred, it is the time of movement itself. Democracy must not be conceived as a movement that has arrived. Bodies do not stop. They resonate, they express, the operate, they sense, they live, they love, but they do not stop unless they die and even then they exfoliate, they decompose. As a sensing liberty—a freedom to sense—democracy’s time is that of the moment endlessly deferred. It is the potential of becom- ing, the espacement that calls forth a trace of its own possibilities.
