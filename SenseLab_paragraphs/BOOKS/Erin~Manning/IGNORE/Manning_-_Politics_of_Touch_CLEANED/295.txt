If politics is understood conventionally as that which renders some bodies legitimate in the name of and through language, a politics of touch can be thought as that which both supports the political and challenges it. In this sense, touch and language perform parallel operations. Yet there is something about the inability to coherently regulate the senses (in this case, touch) that offers the potential for reaching out even beyond words to expose the supple limits of the body.
A politics of touch suggests that one way in which bodies resist normative politics such as those of the nation-state is through reaching across the boundaries imposed by the body-politic. This crossing does not necessarily inaugurate a difference in the political structures at hand, but it does en- gender an adjacent body, a supplementarity, an individuation3 that poten- tially stands in the way of pre-constituted organizations of bodies. The effect of this is by no means utopian: the more complex the bodies at hand, the Ô¨Årmer the imposition of the norms of the governing body-politic. Nonetheless, engenderings brought forth through a politics of touch open the way to a wider selection of bodies, allowing us to explore them in all of their engendered and engendering matter-forms.
