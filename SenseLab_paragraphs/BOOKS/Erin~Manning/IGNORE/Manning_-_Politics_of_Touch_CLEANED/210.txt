traditionally would take precedence, but the thumb, for the thumb denoted the sovereignty of the creator, designated since Hippocratic medicine “the great ﬁnger.”
What are God and Adam’s index ﬁngers reaching toward, if not the touch of an other? Perhaps one of the things taking place on this remarkable ceiling is the realization of the earthly impossibility of touching God. Perhaps there is, in this exchange between ﬁngers that do not meet, a suspicion of the violence necessary for their meeting, the violence that would challenge the sovereign God to actually touch the chaotic masses who themselves have taken the risk to reach toward the unknowable and who are continu- ally transformed through this contact with the body-in-metamorphosis. Is it possible that these index ﬁngers reaching toward one another connote a larger and more explicit act of reaching-toward, symbolized through the hand? Indeed, in Renaissance art the hand was often conceived of as a metonym for the human body. In fact, the thumb (pollex, derived from the verb polleo) continues to be connected to the notion of political rule, sym- bolizing strength, power, and potency.
