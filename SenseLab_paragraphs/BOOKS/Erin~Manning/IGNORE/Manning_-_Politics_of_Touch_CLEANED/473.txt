The BwO disturbs space-time. But it does not do so simply by entering it. It emerges through it. “It is in the BwO that the organs enter into the rela- tions of composition called the organism. The BwO howls: ‘They’ve made me an organism! They’ve wrongfully folded me! They’ve stolen my body!’” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 159). The making of a subject is the rendering- signiﬁcant of a body claimed as docile. The docile body is tactful: it does not reach. But a body that is subjectiﬁed is never subjectiﬁed forever. Tact rests on a structure of appearance that can be dismantled. The body morphs and resists, despite its-self, despite the state, despite the sovereign. The body swings between stratiﬁcation and experimentation. The body is never content to sit still: it must become. “A perpetual and violent combat between the plane of consistency, which frees the BwO, cutting across and disman- tling all of the strata, and the surfaces of stratiﬁcation that block it or make it recoil” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 159).
