In this scene, we witness once more the bibli- cal relation between touch, presence, absence, faith, and untouchability. Interdiction of contact is the ﬁrst injunction. When he appears to her, Mary reaches toward Jesus. Asked not to touch, she does not lay her hands on his body. Thomas, who refuses to believe, demands to be allowed to touch Jesus. After laying his hands on Jesus’ body, he calls Jesus his savior. At ﬁrst glance, it would seem that Jesus is touchable only for Thomas, that a certain relation is established between Jesus and Thomas, rather than between Mary and Jesus. It seems to me that something more is at stake. If we think of touch as a reaching-toward that moves in the direction of experience rather than toward a pursuit of knowledge (a means to an end) might it not be Mary—as beﬁts her role as the bearer of touch in the Bible—who in fact engages touchingly toward Jesus? If this is the case, would Thomas— as beﬁts his role as the doubting disciple—not be seen engaging in the act most distant from a politics of touch, that is, in an act of discerning the “truth” through a laying of hands? The injunction not to touch in the noli me tangere scene is perhaps about delimiting the political and ethical difference between reaching-toward and the amassing of pre-deﬁnable knowledge.
