This book is about “what we do.”
Politics of Touch is deeply indebted to Eric, Komala, Henry, and Stefan, whose love of tango sustains El Corte in Nijmegen, Holland. The tango lived and danced at El Corte is an inspiration both lyrical and political. In Montreal tango and beyond, I thank Mireille, Walter, Enrique, Richard, Ruth, Fernando, Toine, Ines, and so many other dancers with whom improvi- sation and creation go hand in hand.
Those who taught me to think hard about politics have a central place in the attempt to (re)articulate the political in Politics of Touch. I thank Michael Shapiro, Bill Connolly, Michael Dillon, Rob Walker, Jenny Edkins. Interdisciplinary thinking ﬁnds a powerful voice in research-creation.
Few writers capture that environment as well as Steven Shaviro, Brian Mas- sumi, and Isabelle Stengers. My words would exist in a vacuum without yours.
