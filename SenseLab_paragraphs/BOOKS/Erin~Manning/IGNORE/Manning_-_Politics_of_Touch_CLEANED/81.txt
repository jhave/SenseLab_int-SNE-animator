The potentiality that is at the base of my reaching out toward an other is not effaced in the passage to actuality. Quite the contrary: in my turn toward an other, I engage with the very potentiality of extending my-self, of challenging my-self to feel the presence (and absence) of that other. Aristotle, on the other hand, would argue that every gesture performed by a citizen (a man) is pre-ordained toward the potentiality of inaugurating a polis, or a plu- rality of like-minded individuals. Yet gesture (reaching-toward) as I am us- ing it here implies something far more tenuous and ephemeral. As I reach toward, I reach not toward the “you” I ascertain but toward the “you” you will become in relation to our exchange. I reach out beyond the pre- constituted time and space of the Aristotelian polis. The Aristotelian notion of the polis seeks to stabilize the experience of encounter still so central to our understanding of the political, conﬁning politics to a space-time that must be governed and contained. I would like to explore the possibility that a politics of touch as a discourse of potentiality-in-movement might function as the very antithesis of this evocation of the state-system.
