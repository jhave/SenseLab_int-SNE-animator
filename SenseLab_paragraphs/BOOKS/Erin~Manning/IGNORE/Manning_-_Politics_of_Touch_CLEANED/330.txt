SET’s central idea is that “extra genes in the cytoplasm of plant, animal and other nucleated cells are not ‘naked genes’; rather, they originated as bacterial genes” (Margulis 1998, 37).15 Of primary concern here is not simply the biological trajectory from ingestion to mitosis (cell division) through meiosis (two-parent sexual reproduction) but how symbiosis challenges the concept of individual selection essential to Darwinian and neo-Darwinian theories of evolution. In the Darwinian and neo-Darwinian literature, meiotic sex is foregrounded as the primary tool for the reproduction of the species. The Darwinian and neo-Darwinian understanding of sex and repro- duction relies on scarcity, effort, and gratiﬁcation. However, meiotic sex, according to endosymbiosis, is not necessarily the most successful form of reproduction. As Margulis and Sagan write, meiotic sex constitutes “a balanc- ing act between our existence as bodies with two sets of chromosomes that inevitably die, and sex cells made by these bodies with one set of chromo- somes which enjoy the possibility of continued life in the next generation” (1997, 83).
