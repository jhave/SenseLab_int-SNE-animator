Politics should work by invention. Politics of Touch makes a pact to invent, event-fully, what a body can do. Invention here takes the matter-form of touch. Touch, alongside politics, invents by drawing the other into relation, thereby qualitatively altering the limits of the emerging touched-touching bodies. Touch is not graspable as a stable concept. The only thing we can grasp, momentarily, are touchâ€™s inventions. Relational time-space, provisional embodiments are inventions of touch: the body senses in layers, in textures, in rhythms and juxtapositions that defy strict organization into a semiotic system.
