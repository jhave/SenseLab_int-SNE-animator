How the body materializes and dematerializes is signiﬁcant for a politics that is concerned with bodies. When we conceive of democracy through a politics of touch, we assume that there is a body to reach toward. The pre- sumption that the body is concrete is based, too often, on a ﬁxed, territorial- ized, secure entity. If we approach the body’s surfaces as asignifying, we begin to be aware of the manner in which bodies are marked for their coherence through recognizable signs of race, sex, gender, ethnicity. A naturalization of these markings (in the name of national body-politics, of gender or race politics) is the reason we are so quick to recognize and identify these markers. Of course bodies can never be reduced to these external signs. But systems of governance rely on these signs to compartmentalize the bodies in their midst. Politics is instrumental in creating and being created by the bodies it attempts to govern. Politics of touch makes palpable difference engendered, identity individuating, race transducing. Within a politics of touch, bodies govern democracy as much as democracy governs bodies.
