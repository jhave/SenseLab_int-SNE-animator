Good sense and common sense are not going anywhere. They are em- bedded in dreams of policy that hold themselves (without imagination) to a world that does not change. There is no such world, of course.16 To quote Deleuze once more: Common sense identiﬁes and recognizes, no less than good sense foresees. Subjectively, common sense subsumes under itself the various faculties of the soul, or the differentiated organs of the body, and brings them to bear upon a unity which is capable of saying “I.”... The complementarity of the two forces of good sense and common sense are clearly seen. Good sense could not ﬁx any beginning, end, or direction, it could not distribute any diversity, if it did not transcend itself toward an instance capable of relating the diverse to the form of a subject’s identity, or to the form of an object’s or a world’s permanence, which one assumes to be present from beginning to end. Conversely, this form of identity within common sense would remain empty if it did not transcend itself toward an instance capable of determin- ing it by means of a particular diversity, which would begin here, end there, and which one would suppose to last as long as it is necessary to assure the equalization of its parts.
