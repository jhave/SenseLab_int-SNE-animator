Does a mother’s touch alter her child’s brain chemistry? According to Michael Meany, McGill University professor of medicine, “various stress- related illnesses, including depression, anxiety disorders, immune dysfunctions, drug abuse, obesity and heart disease, could hinge on early life experience” (Montreal Gazette, 2 October 2004). Early life experience, as Meany deﬁnes it, is intrinsically linked to touch. His research indicates, for instance, that baby rats with high-licking mothers have lower levels of stress hormones. This suggests that healthy children are directly proportional to touching mothers. Blood relations are not key: adoptive mothers can perform the same tasks with similar effects.
