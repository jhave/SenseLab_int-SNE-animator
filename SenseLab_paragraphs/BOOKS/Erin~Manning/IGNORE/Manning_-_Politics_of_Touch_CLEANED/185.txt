Finally, Lai-Yu Fai is on his way to Iguazu Falls, Piazzola playing in the back- ground. The road is ﬂat, uneventful. The shot frames Fai driving, shifting then to Po-Wing, in the very different setting of El Sur, dancing. The scene cuts to the kitchen tango between Po-Wing and Lai-Yu Fai, the images moving restlessly between the past and the present. In Buenos Aires, night falls as Po-Wing passes out on the cobblestones in front of the tango bar. Silence. It is midnight. We cut to Fai cleaning out the apartment, to longer night silences, to Fai losing himself in the lamp of the falls, crying, Piazzola playing once again in the background. “I ﬁnally reach Iguazu,” says Lai-Yu Fai in the voice-over. “Suddenly, I think of Po-Wing. I feel very sad. I be- lieve there should be two of us standing here.” The falls are majestic, alive, caught by the lens of the camera in shades of blue, the camera itself wet from the mist and the drops of water in the air. This is a long, slow shot. Time is no longer of the essence. The bodies have shifted, creating a new time and space, a spaced-time, a timed-space.
