Now that the link between touch and violence is becoming more appar- ent, it is necessary to draw a map for violence and the political. It will then become possible to orchestrate a symphonic rendering of the link between touch and the political, a link which I believe will be useful in the rethinking of what it means to touch an other. Here, the political implies a relationship (in disagreement) with an other that calls for an important measure of difference and can assist in the creation of time and space. I would like to imagine creation of time and space in accordance with the notion that the body exceeds its own boundaries, making it impossible for us to draw a sensual body as a stable entity within time and space. Time and space here become excessive even to themselves, an echo of the multidimension- ality of sensation, of difference, of overlapping reciprocities. I would like to suggest, also, that the violence that erupts through the many ruptures and transformations involved in the sensing, touching body can be conceived of as different from and more productive than the violence the state imposes onto the “stable” bodies of its citizens.
