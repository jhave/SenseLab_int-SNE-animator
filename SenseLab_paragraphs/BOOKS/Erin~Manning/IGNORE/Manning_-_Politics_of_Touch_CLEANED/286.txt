A sensing body is an inﬁnite body. Inﬁnity is not eternity. A sensing body does not return to the garden nor does it perform miracles through touch. A sensing body ruptures conceptions of time and space that are considered stable, reaching toward a continued metamorphosis of the body that vio- lently spaces time and times space. Acute senses allow the world to appear in relation. Bodies are qualitatively altered by sense. Bodies emerge as multi- tudes, inﬁnitely sensing in excess of their organisms, reaching toward songs of experience. “We live as one man; for contracting our inﬁnite senses / We behold multitude; or expanding; we behold as one” (1991b, 38, 34, 17–19).
