In bacteria, under conditions that necessitate meiotic sex, a “gender” trans- formation of the cell occurs that calls forth not two genders but dozens of complimentary genders that attract each other. Sexual reproduction can therefore be understood as an open system that has evolved many times on this planet: “the second Law of Thermodynamics, rather than sex itself, is the physical basis of our evolutionary focus on copulation and sex acts”16 (Margulis and Sagan 1997, 220). The link between sex and reproduction is contingent. Engenderings may cause genderings, but it is just as likely that they will individuate to create less predictable outcomes. Genderings are but one possible consequence of engenderings: engenderings create the poten- tial for relations that remain unthinkable, individuating toward metastabil- ity in directions we can but begin to reach toward.
