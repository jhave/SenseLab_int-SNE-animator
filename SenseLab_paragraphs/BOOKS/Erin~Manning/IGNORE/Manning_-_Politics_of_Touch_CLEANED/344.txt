We step off the dance ﬂoor, seeking abandoned chairs, precariously aware that we have partaken in a symbiotic individuation that happens very rarely, usually only for an instant. Tango, a dance that can appear terribly constrained, led us momentarily to a qualitative change that modiﬁed our bodies in relation. Affective recom- binations still resound in our now solitary bodies. We will not forget this experience: we are marked from the inside out.
