What Wong Kar Wai signals via these transitory statements is the paradox of the perhaps, that is, the many processes of negotiation that occur in a world in which multiplicities invade the straightforwardness of closeted “identities.” Po-Wing and Fai explore and challenge the bounds of friendship, love, and ultimately, politics. Their failure, in the case of their love affair, is their lack of con-tact, the impossibility of touch as creation. With regard to friendship, Derrida writes: “The possibilization of the impossible possible must remain at one and the same time as undecidable— and therefore as decisive—as the future itself” (1997, 29). Friendship must be thought as an eruption in time and space, a rupture in movement, rather than a point on a grid. It is an interruption because it leads bodies in motion in new and unexpected directions, in a suspension that calls forth an other. Friendship is a movement of desire that threatens to make us lose our balance. It is a movement that eludes consistency while redeﬁning this very concept. Friendship is a relation of permanence that deﬁes the permanent, a presence that must remain an absence, an existence that grows bifurcated like a rhizome erupting at the frontiers of chance and necessity. Friendship is a politics of touch not because it incites us to touch, but because friendship knows no other way of taking place than in con-tact, in a placing of oneself into the space-time of an other, a reaching for an other’s place, a touching of that place initiated in the process of reaching-out.
