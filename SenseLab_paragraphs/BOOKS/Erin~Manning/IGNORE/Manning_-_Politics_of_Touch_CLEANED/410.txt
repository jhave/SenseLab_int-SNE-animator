Corporeal existence is generative and generous in its inclusiveness; an inÔ¨Ånite partitioning, mediated from and within itself; an animated repre- sentation whose fractured mirroring includes cellular and atomic life. The intricate embrace of these recognitions is the matter of corporeality wherein recognition, a virtual splitting, is the stuff of reality. (1997, 146)
