“Here we had no idea where to go,” says Lai-Yu Fai in a voice-over, the image in black and white. “Then Po-Wing bought a lamp. I really liked it. We wanted to ﬁnd this waterfall and ﬁnally we learned it is at Iguazu. We wanted to go home after it, but we lost our way.” Losing one’s way becomes the metaphor of Happy Together, and with it comes the stark realization that “starting over” provokes a loss of footing, the impossibility of ﬁnally locating the body in a pre-ordained time and space.
