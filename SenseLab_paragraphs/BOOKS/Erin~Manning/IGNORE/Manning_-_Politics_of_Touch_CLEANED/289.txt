Our skin is the most sensitive and oldest of our organs. It is our most efÔ¨Åcient of protectors. The skin arises from the outermost of three embryonic cell layers, the ectoderm, which gives rise to the hair, teeth, and the sense or- gans of smell, taste, hearing, vision, and touch. Touch is the earliest sense to develop in the human embryo. It gives us our experience of depth and thickness and shape. Skin develops sensitivities that depend largely on the kind of environmental stimulation it receives. The skin is a central organ system of the body. Without the functions performed by the skin, we can- not survive.
