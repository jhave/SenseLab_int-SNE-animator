I reach toward your mystery, the alchemy of your ï¬‚esh, the untouchability of the experience that we will become as we alter space-time together. Perhaps this explains the proliferation of paintings of the noli me tangere scene. These paintings, which expose a certain unknowability in the rela- tion between Jesus and Mary Magdalene, focus in different and interesting ways on the hands. In some cases, hands connote a separation, in some a desire to touch, a reaching-toward, a sexual longing, a prayer, a benediction, a warning. There is no consensus on the nature of the touch that takes place. Touch and undecidability go hand in hand. Mary understands the untouchability of touch. Mary reaches toward this untouchability not seeking truth, nor the Word, but the contact that will engage her in a relation to the  unknowable  she  already  knows  well.
