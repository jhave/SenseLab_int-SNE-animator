The body is multiple. There is no particular BwO. My body intensiÔ¨Åes differently with every reaching-toward. There is no unique experience of touch. Touch, as Nancy writes, is singulier-pluriel. Touch is duration.8 Static, bodies do not not make space for touch as a reaching-toward. Static, we re- main tactful, although our determination does not exhaust the potential of our body. Too abstract? Not abstract enough.
