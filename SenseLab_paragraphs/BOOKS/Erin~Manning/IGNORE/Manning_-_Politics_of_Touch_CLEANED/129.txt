“Why would the friend be like a brother?” asks Derrida. “Let us dream of a friendship which goes beyond this proximity of the congeneric double, beyond parenthood . . .” (1997, viii). Friendship that might be worthy of the name, that is, a politics of friendship, would be a movement of desire that cannot be symbolized through a coding in a fraternal nationalism. It would be a friendship of and toward sensation, a friendship toward the mul- tiple movements of an other. Not a friendship toward establishing identities of coupling, identities of nationhood and belonging, but a friendship that is always starting over, with all the complexities of a process that can never quite begin nor end. This is not a straightforward friendship, not an easy friendship, not a friendship of ease. It is a friendship that carries as its impossible memento the lit image of unreachable waterfalls of touristy romance, the impossibility of deﬁnitively locating one’s-self, either here or there.
