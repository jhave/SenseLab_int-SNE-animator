Touch is about movement. Tact refers to a certain preemptive declaration that the body should not move. Tact says, “be careful, do not make yourself known. Retreat.” If bodies move as a quality of their becoming-world as Politics of Touch has argued thus far, how might touch incorporate tact within its deﬁnition? What would be a touch that could be secured by tact? Bodies can be stratiﬁed, organized, categorized, even restrained, but they cannot be stopped. If security implies a certain stopping, or at least stalling of the body, and if tact is complicit with this abeyance of the body, tact would have to be juxtaposed to what the body can do through a politics of touch. Tact in this regard would function as an imposition onto bodies more than a quality of potential reembodiment. Bodies secured with a tactful injunction would have to stop (being bodies). Yet, deﬁnitionally, tact oper- ates within all touch, at least as a supplement. How can we then reconcile
tact and touch?
