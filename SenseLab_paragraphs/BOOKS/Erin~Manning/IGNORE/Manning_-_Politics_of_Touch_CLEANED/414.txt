We write that which we are on the verge of sensing. Writing is not some- thing we return to as ﬁnished: writing is always of the future. Bodies leave traces of themselves everywhere, writing themselves into complex rhizomatic technological, political, corporeal narratives. Politics of representation are complicated by the senses, which refuse to cohere to one story. I cannot sense unilaterally: I smell to see and touch to taste. A politics of touch oper- ates within such shifting skinscapes. As prosthetic to the body, politics must begin to think itself as an extension to the body’s sensing apparatus. Politics is not beyond the body, it is of the body. Bodies sense, and their sensing movements reach toward relations of emergence, expressions always already incorporated into political texts. When we accept these postvital incorporations of posthumanity, we envisage a thinking of a future anterior in which democracies remain to come.
