20. On the relation of politics and the future anterior, see Jacques Derrida’s con- cept of “democracy-to-come.” This concept is outlined in many of his texts. See, for example, Derrida (2003).

23. For a detailed understanding of the political concept of disagreement, see Rancière (1999). Rancière writes: “Political rationality is only thinkable precisely on condition that it be greed from the alternative in which a certain rationalism would like to keep it reined in, either as exchange between partners putting their in- terests or standards up for discussion, or else the violence of the irrational” (1999, 43). Disagreement as conceptualized by Rancière takes issue with Habermasian “consen- sual” politics: “[Consensus] comes unstuck as often as speciﬁc worlds of community open up, worlds of disagreement and dissension. Politics occurs wherever a commu- nity with the capacity to argue and to make metaphors is likely, at any time and through anyone’s intervention, to crop up” (1999, 60).
