Warren Montag writes:
Spinoza’s philosophy provides the best illustration of the concept of the immanent cause, a concept that, during the late 17th century, was one of its most scandalous postulates: it is a philosophy that exists in its effects, not prior to them or even independently of them, effects that may remain dormant or deferred for decades or even centuries, (re)activated only in an encounter with unforeseeable theoretical elements that arrive from beyond its boundaries. (Montag and Stolze 1997, x–xi)
For Spinoza, bodies (substances) are not prior to attributes. The cause does not precede its effects. There is no thought of wholeness, of unity, of divi- sion.
