Touch deﬁes stability, renewing itself instead in an ephemeral gesture of reminder. Touch does not make sense if by making sense I refer to something I should always already have known. There is no permanence to touch, only a re-touching. As a sense-generating practice, touch is transitory, short- lived, ungraspable. To make touch last, something must be supplemented: a blow, a grasp, a hold. Touch is a simultaneity of becoming whose character- istic is to elude the “before” and “after,” a becoming that moves in both directions at once. Touch is anathema to what Deleuze calls “good sense,” which “afﬁrms that in all things there is a determinable sense or direction (sens)” (1990b, 1). A democracy-to-come does not embody good sense: it does not incorporate a pre-determined directionality. It is unlimited, becom- ing, individuating, in excess of a language that would seek to ﬁx the limits of sense. Touch senses toward a movement that is layered rather than teleo- logical. Democracy, understood in terms of a politics of touch, can only be conceived as a sense-making practice if we divest sense of its relationship with “good sense.” There is no sense (as a ﬁnal moment) to democracy. Democracy need not make sense, though it should sense, encapsulating a gesturing toward an other that defers toward moments that are thick with movement, with sensation, with experience.
