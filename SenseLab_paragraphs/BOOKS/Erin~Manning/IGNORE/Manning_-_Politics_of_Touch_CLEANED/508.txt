Or, in the words of Spinoza:
Hence we must admit unreservedly that divine right only came into force when men made an explicit pact to obey God in all things; by so doing they so to speak surrendered their natural freedom and transferred their right to God, just as they do in the civil state. (in Montag and Stolze 1997, 198)
