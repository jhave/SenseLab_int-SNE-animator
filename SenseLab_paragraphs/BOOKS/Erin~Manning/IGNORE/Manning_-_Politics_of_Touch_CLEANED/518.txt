How active is my BwO’s relation to the pact? Engaged with/in the multi- tude, I choose a position. This position can be tenuous: I can suggest that the choice was made for me or despite me. Choosing implies a will that sug- gests that modulations are overlaid with an interweaving of activity and passivity, no matter where our movements lead us. To be properly ethical for Spinoza implies ﬁnding a way to implicate oneself in one’s own ideas: “The actions of the mind arise from adequate ideas alone. The passions de- pend on inadequate ideas alone” (in Deleuze 1990a, 221). The political question is: how can we produce adequate ideas? For Spinoza, inadequate ideas lead to suffering: “The capacity of being affected is called a power of suffering insofar as it is actually exercised by passive emotions. The body’s power of suffering has as its equivalent in the mind the power of imagining and of experiencing passive feelings” (Deleuze 1990a, 222).
