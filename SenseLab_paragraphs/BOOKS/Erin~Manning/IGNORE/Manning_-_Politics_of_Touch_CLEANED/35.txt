Politics of Touch asks what a sensing body in movement can do through the prisms of tango, democracies-to-come, violence, security, friendship, gender, biology, sex. The politics of touch outlined here is a politics engaged in a pact to invent new bodies. The question posed is less “what is a sensing body in movement” than “how can I create a sensing body in movement?” The proposition is that touch—every act of reaching toward—enables the creation of worlds. This production is relational. I reach out to touch you in order to invent a relation that will, in turn, invent me. To touch is to engage in the potential of an individuation. Individuation is understood through- out as the capacity to become beyond identity. We individuate inventively. Relationally, we engage in individuations that require difference and repe- tition. Without difference that repeats, we foreclose the process, returning the body to territorialization, national body-politics, stable genders, politi- cal consensus.
