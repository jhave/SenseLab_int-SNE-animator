The ﬁnal moment of contact between Chang and Lai-Yu Fai is poignant, expressed through the sense of hearing. Chang explains to Fai that he is on his way to Ushuaia, a place known as “the end of the world.” There, the legend goes, people are invited to dump all their emotional problems. Since Chang does not like photographs, he asks Fai to leave a few words on his tape recorder as a memento, words he will then leave in Ushuaia. “Any- thing from your heart,” Chang tells Fai as he moves away to dance. “Even say something sad. I’ll carry it to the end of the world.” “I’m not sad,” Fai responds. “Something cheerful, then.” For a long time, Fai holds the recorder to his mouth, sitting alone in the corner. Then he begins to cry, to sob, to throw up. He cannot speak, he cannot make contact. Chang leaves with the empty message. Lai-Yu Fai returns to hug him. “How is it we’ve become so close?” Lai-Yu Fai asks himself in a voice-over. “For a moment all I can hear is my own heart beating. Does he hear it too?” Through listening (even to his own silence, to his own heart beating), Fai has been touched, he has made con-tact.
