The tango embrace is the political gesture with which the mediality of tango is initiated. It is this embrace which invites the potential emergence of a medium, a milieu independent of pre-ordained constraints. This medium can feed an already troubled relationship between self and other, between woman and man, leader and follower. In this case, the embrace is a means to an end, signaling a familiar restoring of the genre. Or this embrace can challenge the concept of the milieu through a politics of touch that engages in the means, that is, in the potential of listening to the breath, the body, the distance and the closeness of another human being, a listening to what might be considered the very ethics-in-deconstruction of humanity.
