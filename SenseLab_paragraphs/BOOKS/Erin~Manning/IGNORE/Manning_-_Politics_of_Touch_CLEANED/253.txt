The state does not react calmly to such treason. The state continually reproduces its limits by transcribing alterity into a system of self-same bodies that perpetuate the task of policing the border between inside and outside in order to be certain that we do not reach over that border to touch another who is not our-selves. The body is incited to remain that which is attached to the state, lest its detachment result in political disqualiﬁcation. Within the national imaginary, the body functions as the recuperation of the in- tegrity of the state, an integrity that is only “achieved” through violence. But the body ﬁnds ways to escape the grid of sovereignty. This occurs despite our-selves, since we cannot stop our-selves from reaching out to touch an other. We touch an other to see if our vision serves us right. We touch to feel if we, if you, exist. We touch, always, beyond the boundary of self and other.
