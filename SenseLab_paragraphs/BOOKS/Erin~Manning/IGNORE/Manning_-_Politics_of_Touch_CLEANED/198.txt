Could we suggest, then, that reaching out to touch an other is a moment of acknowledgment, a moment of recognition of the will not toward God but toward the earth? Might we conceive of touch as a reaching out toward the everyday, toward the textuality and the movement of our bodies, of our lives, of our diverse experiences on the earth? Touch is not, it seems to me, a bordered practice: we know our bodies to exist always outside of their skins, beyond our-selves, in excess of our three-dimensionality. It is not the body’s spirituality that I am trying to evoke here, but the body’s surplus, its sensations, its smells, its visions, its joys, its pain. We are these excessive bodies. Yet our history in the West is, at least according to Christianity, one of great repentance about this excessiveness. To atone, we must refrain, return the apple to the garden, withdraw the touch that seduces us, inciting us to continue to reach toward experience and debasement, desire and madness. Touch is the articulation that continues to hold us, virtually, to the gar- den. In reaching out to you, I entice you to become a medium of expression. I ask you to participate. I invite you to experience. As my sensation trans- lates itself to you, you immediately convey to me a response to this touch. This multidimensional movement of desire is violent, for it presupposes a certain demand, a decision, an instance of response-ability. This response charges your body with the potential seduction of wanting to re-embody itself with and alongside mine. There is no need for the creation of space-time in the garden of Eden. “Refrain!” screams God. For in each of these con-tacts, a new body is born, an articulation is taken into consideration, a bite of experience is consumed, and the risk of a loss of footing is guaranteed.
