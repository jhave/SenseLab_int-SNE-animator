If political thought is reoriented toward practices of sense that compli- cate teleologies of signiﬁcation, the political emerges as a virtual embodi- ment of sensations of difference rather than an actual mold of “good” sense. A politics of touch resists a reorientation toward the dichotomy between here and there, good and evil, sense and signiﬁcation. Politics of touch thereby avoids strict conditions of denotation, extending itself toward expression: The duality in the proposition is not between two sorts of names, names of stasis and names of becoming, names of substances or qualities and names of events; rather, it is between two dimensions of the proposition, that is, between denotation and expression, or between the denotation of things and the expression of sense.
