This image of leading and following in Argentine tango foregrounds the potential for an engendering that tackles the problematics of gender with- out needing to draw a ﬁrm boundary between gendered notions of gender. Here, what is engendered must no longer be strictly codiﬁed as strictly “mas- culine” or “feminine.” Bodies multiply and strands of gendered responses escape, perhaps bewildering those bodies from which they emanate. The result are new conﬁgurations of “gender” that exceed particular bodies. Bodies that are qualitatively altered are no longer predominantly recognized as “male” or “female,” “leader” or “follower.” These bodies now locate them- selves as experiments-in-movement, qualitatively in-formed by the dance. My body is no longer strictly my own. The envelope of my skin is but the inception of my re-engendering.
