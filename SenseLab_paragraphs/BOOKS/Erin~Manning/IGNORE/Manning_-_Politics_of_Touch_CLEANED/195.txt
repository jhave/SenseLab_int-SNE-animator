To make a decision is a political event. It is a moment of response-ability, a tempered instance of reaching-out, a touching of that which I do not yet know, a touching of an other in a reciprocal engagement with the unknowable. In the garden of Eden, the apple signiﬁes all that is unknown. To touch, and then to eat the apple, is to make the decision to opt for the life of the earth over the life of the heavens. The touching of the apple is the violent entry into the political, if we conceive of the political as the moment of decision that engages us toward the world and therefore toward an other. Reaching out and touching the apple — opting for the ﬁnite instead of the inﬁnite —is a violent decision because it implies a fall, a loss of ground, an unevenness between what can be imagined and what is beyond the scope of my experience. A certain violence takes place the moment I realize I must make a decision. A certain violence is omnipresent in the realization of the potential rupture between the endless vista of conformity heaven represents and the chaos of the world. The violent moment of decision in the touching of the apple is the moment when I realize that I have “fallen,” that there is no longer a separation between self and other, between Adam and Eve and the rest of humanity. As Hent de Vries and Samuel Weber write, “violence” could no longer be considered simply to “befall” its victims from without, but rather would be related to what is generally presupposed to be its other: the “inviolate” self (1997, 2).
