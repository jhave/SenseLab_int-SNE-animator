The body, the political corpus, is ï¬‚esh, limited, wounded, challenged and challenging. The body senses, dissents and consents. To touch is to engage in a con-sentment that is confronted by the specter of incommunicability, of disagreement. The terrible challenge inherent in a politics of touch is that is excribes presence, denying me the possibility of presenting myself to you as always already whole. Touch traces the trace, the incorporeal, effac- ing you as presence, inviting you to be a political corpus in process, a Body without Organs, a becoming-world.
