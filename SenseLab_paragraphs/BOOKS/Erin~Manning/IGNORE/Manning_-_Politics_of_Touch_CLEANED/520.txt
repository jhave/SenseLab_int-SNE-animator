The question of modes leads us toward an issue central to a Spinozean reading of the body: of what is a body capable? A body wills itself collec- tively into passivity, into affection, into movement. But this is not a didactic gesture. A movement toward an other contains our uncertainty as regards what affections we are capable of expressing. When I reach toward, I cannot yet know the extent of our power, for this potentia remains to be produced.
