The Gospels are propelled by the word of God. God speaks, and his lan- guage will be the language of creation beyond and despite and because of the Fall; his will be the language of an exclusionary garden that negates the creative potential of experience. His words will trace within their wake the primacy of reason. Yet touch and/as untouchability are still at stake, as we see in Mark 16, despite what seems initially to be a departure from the con- cerns of the originary garden. I am referring here to the noli me tangere (do not touch me) episode, a strange encounter with the senses that is my entry point to a second reading of the encounter between touch and untouchability in the Bible. This reading of the untouchable will lead me to thework of William Blake, where another rendition of the Fall will seek to undermine any leftover dichotomy between good and evil, between reason and the senses, exposing the supplementary relation between touch and untouchability.
In the noli me tangere scene, Mary Magdalene faces Jesus. As she reaches out to touch him, Jesus says: “Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God” (John 20:17). As the news of Jesus’s resuscitation begins to spread, Thomas remains un- believing and beseeches Jesus to allow him to touch despite the injunction not to touch. Jesus responds: “Reach hither thy ﬁnger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing” (John 20:27).
