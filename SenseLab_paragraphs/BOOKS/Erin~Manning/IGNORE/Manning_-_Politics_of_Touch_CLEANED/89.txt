Nancy writes: “Sign of itself, and being-itself of the sign: such is the double formula of the body in all states, in all its possibilities” (1994, 21). Wounded by the state, and a wound within the state, the body opens unto itself and unto an other. But the wound also closes itself, thick with scar tissue, anx- ious to touch and be touched, lulled into a commonsense revolution by a policing that holds an other (and its wound) at bay. At the same time, the wound itself lives within the body, resisting the closure of meaning, of sense. It is this resistance, this urge to touch an other, wound against wound, that potentially creates a community of resistance, a complex, disorderly, incom- mensurable community of those who cannot keep themselves from reaching out toward the world.
