Touch is expressive. The expressivity of touch is political: expressivity pro- vides an opening for an event. If we persist in working through the various guises of eventness—relation, engendering, expression, extension, affect— we continue to widen the opening for politics. The ongoing proposition of Politics of Touch is to enable politics to recapture expression and extend it. Creating an environment for politics is part of the thinking that accom- panies these extensions, be they expressive, sensing, engendering.
