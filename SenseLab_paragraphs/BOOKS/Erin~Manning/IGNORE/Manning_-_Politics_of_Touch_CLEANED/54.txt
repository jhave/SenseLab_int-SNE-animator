Politics of Touch in every instance tries to resist a repositioning of the body as ontological. Sensing bodies in movement are ontogenetic. They are ontogenetic because they are always in genesis, in a state of potential becoming. An ontology of the body presupposes a concrete category of Being. Yet, bodies evolve in excess of their Being: they become. Becoming-bodies sig- nal a certain antagonism within politics of the state. This does not imply that a becoming-body is unaccountable. A becoming-body is accountable to becoming more than its-self. But be careful: there is nothing utopic about becoming-bodies. Ontogenesis is a slippery category: it is that which is not yet. I cannot write the body in advance of its creation, of its movement. The body will remain in an antagonistic relation to its accountability.
Affect plays a central role in Politics of Touch. Affect is not emotion, though it does play on the idea of movement within the word emotion. Emo- tion is affect plus an awareness of that affect. Affect is the with-ness of the movement of the world. Affect is that which grips me ﬁrst in the moment of relation, ﬁrstness in Charles Peirce’s vocabulary.7 Affect is an ontogenetic power of existence. Emotion is the back-gridding of affect.
