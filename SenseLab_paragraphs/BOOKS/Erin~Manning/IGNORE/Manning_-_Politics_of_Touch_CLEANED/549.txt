An incommensurability of politics signals the necessity to reassess, continu- ously, where politics takes place. This can only be successful if we become aware of the manner in which we space and time, actively, virtually. A con- cept of liberty cannot be other than a concept involving moving bodies. A free body is not a secured body. Liberty, politics, bodies have no pre- established form. But they can form, their shapes mutating in the process, individuating, expanding, intensifying. “Freedom: to measure oneself against nothing” (Nancy 1994, 71).
