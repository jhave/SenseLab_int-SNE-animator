The dance ﬂoor is crowded. I enter through an unmarked door in a strange city. I have never been here before, but I recognize the scene. Lights are dimmed, in the far corner I observe the DJ, the bar is surrounded by people sipping their drinks with their eyes on the dance ﬂoor. A few people are engaged in conversation. I look for a seat to change my shoes. Finally, I notice a spare chair with someone else’s bag hanging from the back. I sit down, hurrying to get ready before I have to forsake the chair.
