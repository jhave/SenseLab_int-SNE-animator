Genesis and the noli me tangere episode share an engagement with the threat and potential violence of touch. In Genesis, the threat is that touch will propel Adam and Eve out of the garden into experience. In the noli me tangere episode, the threat is more complex: if Mary touches Jesus, she relegates her faith to the promise of corporeal presence. If Mary does not touch Jesus, she accepts the incorporeality of touch as a potential violence toward the concept of presence. Thomas does touch Jesus, but only to justify his faith. Mary, on an other hand, accepts that Jesus is no longer touchable as a healer but must be reached-toward differently. Jesus is thus relegated to the unknowability of presence as absence, and touch to a gesture in passing. Jesus is both of the earth (having fallen toward touch) and of the heavens (moving toward a Godliness that would render him permanently untouch- able). The ﬁgure who remains most interesting in relation to touch is Mary. “It is a good thing not to touch a woman,” writes Paul (1 Cor. 7:1).
