Can I touch without violence? Can I think of transformation without being jolted by the violence of change? Can I even consider the reciprocal relationship that exists when I reach out to touch you (when I become other through touch) without being aware of the violence induced by my recognition of myself as other? As de Vries writes, “What would it mean to think of violence as an inescapable horizon or inherent potentiality of any act, or of any refraining from action?” (1997, 18). Is violence not intimately engaged in the historicization of the body, of Being as such? “Discourse,” suggests de Vries, “whether inﬁnite or not, whether ethical or not, demands some negotiation with its other—namely, violence—if it is to minimize the risk of allowing the worst violence to come to pass” (1997, 24). Must the discursive body, the body in movement that reaches out to touch, always also be a violent body, and if so, can we recognize violence not only as the harbinger of guilt but also of experience? For the apple is about experience, even if this experience is that of the “baseness” of humanity.
