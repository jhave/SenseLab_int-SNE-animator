A slow, homogenous world often supports undemocratic hierarchy because it irons out discrepancies of experience through which constituencies can become reï¬‚ective about self-serving assumptions they habitually use to ap- praise themselves in relation to others. But in a world marked by asym- metrical zones of speed, it is critical that citizens in a variety of walks of life be provided with structural opportunities for periodic escape and retreat from a fast-paced life.
