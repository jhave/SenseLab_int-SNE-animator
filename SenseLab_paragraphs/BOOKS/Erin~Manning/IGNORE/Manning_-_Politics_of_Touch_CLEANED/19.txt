Montreal is a magic place. I thank those artists—among them Luc Courchesne, Freda Guttman, Rafael Lozanno-Hemmer, Lynn Hughes, Richard Kerr, Chris Salter, Sha Xin Wei— who continue to make it a stimulating creative environment.
In 2004, I established the Sense Lab (www.thesenselab.com) at Concordia University with the idea that students, artists, and researchers could work together on projects related to the sensing body in movement. Thank you to those who have shared time, ideas, and enthusiasm. The Sense Lab would not be such a stimulating environment without the indomitable energies of Nadine Asswad, who is not only central to the conceptualization and orchestration of events but takes the research-creation approach to heart, bringing sincerity and generosity into the mix. Sincere thanks also to Tagny Duff, Nasrin Himada, Marie-Èvelyne Leclerc-Chevrier, Ronald Rose- Antoinette, Troy Rhoades, Alanna Thain, Céline Pereira.
There needn’t be a gulf between thought, friendship, and family. I learned this with extraordinary warmth from Ben Jones and continue to live it with Margaret McCullough, Pascale Manning, Yves Manning, Eric Manning, Brian Massumi, Jesse Massumi, Mireille Painchaud, Ken Dean, Catherine Herrmann. This is where politics of touch begin.
Politics of touch exist in relation. Thank you, Brian, for your exquisite intensity, creativity, rigor. Thinking-with is an experience that has changed my life. This would have been another book without you.
I began this book with the generous assistance of a postdoctoral Social Sciences and Humanities Research Grant and ﬁnished it with the support of an ongoing grant from the Fonds québécois de recherche sur la société et la culture.
