Sense is an event. Deleuze writes: “It is the characteristic of events to be expressed or expressible, uttered or utterable, in propositions which are at least possible” (1990b, 12). An investigation of sense (making sense and/as sensation) allows us to begin to explore the manner in which the standard- ized discourse of the political (operative within state sovereignty and the nation-state system) relies on making good sense rather than on sensing. There need not be a dichotomy between making sense and sensing, for both engage in similar dynamics, expressing the event in a manner that is lived through and in the body. I make sense through sense. Certainly a long line of thought in political  philosophy,  beginning  with  Plato  and  continu- ing through Descartes and beyond, locates “making sense” with reason, out- side the body, but if we allow ourselves to re-place making sense as an event in and of the body, it soon becomes apparent that making sense need not stand apart from sensing. Intelligibility need not rest on the trouble- some attachment of knowledge as reason. In the end, it may be reasonable to sense.
