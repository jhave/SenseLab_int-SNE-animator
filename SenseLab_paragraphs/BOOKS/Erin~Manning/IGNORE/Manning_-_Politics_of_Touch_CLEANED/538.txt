[T]he posthuman view thinks of the body as the original prosthesis we all learn to manipulate, so that extending or replacing the body with other prostheses becomes a continuation of a process that began before we were born.... [T]he posthuman view conÔ¨Ågures human being so that it can be seamlessly articulated with intelligent machines. In the posthuman, there are no essential differences or absolute demarcations between bodily existence and computer simulation, cybernetic mechanism and biological organism, robot teleology and human goals.... [T]he posthuman subject  is an amalgam, a collection of heterogeneous components, a material- informational entity whose boundaries undergo continuous construction and reconstruction. (1999, 3)
