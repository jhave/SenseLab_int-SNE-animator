Bodies without Organs are castaways. “The body is the holding-together of these virtual innards as they fold out, recursive-durationally, in the loopy present, in determinate form and conﬁguration, always provisional because always in becoming” (Massumi 2002a, 205).9 But bodies are not only virtual. Virtuality must become empirical.10 This is the paradox of the senses: sensing renders the body virtual by exposing it to continual move- ment, yet sensing and senses render the body’s ﬂeshiness actual. My experi- ence of touch is empirical (I touch to “know” the sensation) but radically so: I touch what is always already not-yet there. Bodies as emergent vectors of experience shift between proportions composed of actuality and virtual- ity. Virtuality phases into actuality abstractly. This movement toward the actual is abstract because despite its actuality it is difﬁcult to trace exactly its beginning and its end. As Massumi writes, “The limits as such must be conceived as unmixed but in enough dynamic proximity to interfere with each other in their actual effects as attractors” (2002a, 159). Lurking happens on many levels here. Plateaus are evoked even as the engagement between sense-events is localized. Sense-events are reminders that the virtual and the empirical pass into one-another, challenging body times and spaces, creating and modulating bodies.
