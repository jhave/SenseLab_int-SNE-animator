In  Symbiotic  Planet,  Lynn  Margulis  emphasizes  three  main  points:
(1) Human similarities to other life forms are far more striking than the dif- ferences; (2) Humans are not “better,” “more proliﬁc,” or “more advanced” than any other species; (3) We live on a symbiotic planet. Endosymbiosis extends beyond the biological to the cultural and political realms. Genetic alterations brought about by symbiosis are translated in social and political realms into stereotypes that can also be symbiotically recombined. Forms are altered by matter that does not necessarily take the shape we presuppose. Symbiosis produces engenderings that defy the imagination, opening our worlds to the potential of qualitative change. Relation takes the place of “being,” and we are faced with the fact that not only are our bodies open, symbiotic recombinations, but our political worlds are profoundly altered by a conception of the body that does not depend on systematic ﬁxity, territorial unity or identity. When we begin to think our worlds symbiotically, we be- come aware that the worlds we create are altered by the very symbiotic processes that “we” always already are.
