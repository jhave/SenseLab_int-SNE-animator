You have to keep enough of the organism for it to reform each dawn; and you have to keep small supplies of signiﬁance and subjectiﬁcation, if only to turn them against their own systems when the circumstances demand it, when things, persons, even situations, force you to; and you have to keep small rations of subjectivity in sufﬁcient quantity to enable you to respond to the dominant reality. Mimic the strata. You don’t reach the BwO, and its plane of consistency, by wildly destratifying. (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 160)
