What imperialism requires for its dissemination of power and control is not a politics of touch but a replication of the displacements which would de-politicize this very touch. Tango therefore becomes legendary not as a movement that is political but as one that is thoroughly depoliticized—the exoticized encounter with desire for consummation by busloads of tourists.4 In 1913, Lugones writes: “Tango is not a national dance, nor is the prosti- tution that conceives it” (in Savigliano 1995, 140). To appreciate tango as a transnational movement of desire, it is necessary to acknowledge its disputed beginnings, its contested origins, and its complicated presents. There have always been contestations where tango is concerned, be it the indignation of the Argentinean elite as a betrayed digniﬁed class, or later the immigrants’ disillusionment when the same upper class re-appropriates the tango as its own once it has been usurped by Paris. The story of tango is fraught with such appropriations, with stilted beginnings and truth-seeking nationalisms, with legitimate and illegitimate births and deaths. There is no “true” tango, be it that which is danced in Buenos Aires, or that which is danced in Fin- land, Nijmegen, Montreal, Berlin. Tango is an improvised movement—at its best and most challenging, a politics of touch—carrying within its sen- sory mechanisms the potential instantiation of a politics that might be called a politics of friendship. Tango is a challenge to fraternization as the maxim for democracy even while it is the dream of a nationally uniﬁed identity. Tango is all of these contradictory movements of desire.
