Friendship is not given. If we accept this, can we not accept that neither is democracy a given? Can we not listen to one another disagree, instead of imposing consensus and thus silencing all others, even ourselves? A con- sensual democracy is nothing other than an act of exclusion. This is why the condition of possibility of democracy is at the same time the condition of impossibility of its full realization (Mouffe 1995, 36). “Democracy remains to come” writes Derrida. Democracy, like friendship, like the political, like touch, belongs to the chronotope of the “perhaps,” in the present-to-come. There is no future for democracy, not if democracy is to be political, that is, reinvented, re-contacted, re-sensed. “Even when there is democracy,” writes Derrida, “it never exists, it is never present, it remains the theme of a non- presentable concept” (1997, 306). A politics of touch exceeds democracy as it continues to be implemented, reminding us that democracy can never precede the movements of the body. Through movement we feel, we sense, and it is now, in con-tact with our reaching-toward, that we begin to listen, to engage, to concede, to disagree. This is democracy-to-come, a politics of sensing bodies in movement.
