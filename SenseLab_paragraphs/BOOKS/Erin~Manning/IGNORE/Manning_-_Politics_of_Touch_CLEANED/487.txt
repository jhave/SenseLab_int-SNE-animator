For Spinoza the expressiveness of the body denies any hierarchy between ﬂesh and soul. Thought is at stake: through the body we must think further than we have thought, we must express beyond a thinking of consciousness that has driven us so far. Bodies exceed our knowledge of them. Meetings between “bodies” incite us to create Bodies without Organs which are always, in some sense, bodies of thought. Relationally, we begin to think not the order of causes (and effects) but the play of compositions and decomposi- tions at work. We compose with bodies. Bodies emerge not only as what they are but what they expressively can become.
