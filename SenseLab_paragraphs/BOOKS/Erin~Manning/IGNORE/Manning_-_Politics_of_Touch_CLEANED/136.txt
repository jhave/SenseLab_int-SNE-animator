The qualities of the political in and through friendship are ontogenetic, that is, equal to emergence. They are not qualities derived in mediation, secondary to other primary qualities. Friendship, in this political sense, becomes the signifying ﬁeld of all other political categories, be they those of gender, race, or sexual orientation, of identity, of multiplicity and territoriality. Here, as Massumi suggests, “passage precedes construction” (2002a, 8). Only afterwards does construction back-form its reality. Gridlocking occurs, but it is a positioning on the grid that continues to displace itself, a potential moving-off the grid, a process of grid-remaking that can interrupt the process of feeding back into static time and space. Ontogenesis here refers to the capacity to emerge, to invite a moving-off the grid that challenges stagnant organizations of signifying bodies. A politics that is ontogenetic is a politics that disturbs ontology, a politics that incites us to remember that ontology is always a process of re-placing the body on the grid. A politics of touch, if we consider that friendship always invites a certain touch, can be conceived as a process of de-forming the gridlock capacities of fraternization. By re-connecting (and dis-placing) the points of the grid, and by understand- ing motion not as something that occurs between two points but as that which creates those very points, we can begin to challenge static notions of identity and belonging.
