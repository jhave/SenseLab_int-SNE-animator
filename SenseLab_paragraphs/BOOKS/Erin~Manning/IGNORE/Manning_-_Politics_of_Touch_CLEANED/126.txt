There will be no “going home” for Lai-Yu Fai and Po-Wing because, already, home has become the ever-falling Iguazu that remains unreachable. What is within reach is a multi- plicity of sensations that will lead Po-Wing and Lai-Yu Fai both together and apart, that will challenge the bonds of their friendship and their love, and relocate both Hong Kong and Argentina within the maps constructed by their desiring bodies moving in and across time and space. “We never did ﬁnd out where we were that day,” continues Lai-Yu Fai in voice-over. “He always said days with me were boring, that we should end it, that one day we might start over.”
