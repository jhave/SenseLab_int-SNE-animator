How to negotiate a politics of touch in this complex interplay of security, sovereignty, globalization? How to speak of the body without securing sense? How to speak of the securing of sense when sensing implies a prosthetic thinking of the event always before and in excess of its securing? These are the challenges inherent in writing of movement, of bodies, of politics. The tendency remains, through the writing, to give precedence to a stagnant humanist vocabulary that can be disciplined, controlled. It is difﬁcult not to fall prey to this tendency. Politics of touch ﬁghts this impulse, continuing to challenge the ontological force of existing politics of identity, incarcera- tion, sovereignty, and violence wherever they emerge. There is no stopping: ontogenesis requires invention. All radical engagements are inventions in some sense: unthought, untried, extraordinary. Let us improvise.
