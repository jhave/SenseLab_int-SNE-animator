The networks that produce gendered bodies are themselves prone to individuation. There can be uniﬁed gender neither at the level of the body nor its classiﬁcations. Engendering gender suggests engendering something that can be called “masculine” or “feminine” but that cannot be securely relegated to predictable characteristics that will reproduce themselves coherently under all conditions in all circumstances. Engendering gender presupposes a reaching toward that creates chronotopes that are variable and changeable, individualizing but not individual.
