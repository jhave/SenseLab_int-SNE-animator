Bodies are never completely enslaved to the state because bodies are never completely reducible to either Nature or the state. Bodies become on a con- tinuum that evolves in relation with pacts formed around institutions of power and compliance.
To locate the state on the strata of my BwO is, in some regard, to be- come part of the sovereignâ€™s BwO. It is to create a relation in a direction that holds me to an end-in-sight: becoming-sovereign. It is to believe in a pact that paradoxically excludes touch while it foregrounds tact as a thought- system. It is to mediate the incentive to reach-toward. But it is not to stop movement. Bodies cannot be stopped.
