Perhaps this is why Chang and Fai do not meet in Taipei. Their friend- ship—a friendship-to-come—is not about home, nor is it about “returning.” “I don’t know when I’ll see Chang again,” says Fai in the voice-over once he has arrived in Taipei on his way to Hong Kong. “What I know is, if I want to, I know where I can ﬁnd him.” Friendship turns the world upside down, subverting identities, transgressing nationalities. This is being “happy together.” There is no “home” in this image, no certainty or predictability. It is not about Buenos Aires or about Hong Kong, it is about the movements in the space-times in-between. Is there a thought of democracy here? “It would therefore be a matter of thinking an alterity without hierarchical dif- ference at the root of democracy,” writes Derrida (1997, 232). Can being “happy together” in the sense Wong Kar Wai gives the notion be thought of as a certain agonistic democratic experience of difference? Can bodies in motion meet “democratically”? “This democracy,” writes Derrida, “would free a certain interpretation of equality by removing it from the phallogo-centric schema of fraternity” (1997, 232). A democracy without symmetry, an inﬁnite alterity, a movement that invents divergent positionalities that converge, that make contact, that disperse?
