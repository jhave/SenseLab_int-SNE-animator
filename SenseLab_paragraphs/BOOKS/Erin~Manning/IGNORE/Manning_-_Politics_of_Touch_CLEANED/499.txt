Politics is both of and beyond the structure. Disciplinary politics demands the apparent coherence of the structure. Control societies resist the struc- ture. This is not a dichotomy. All politics is always a passage, even a seden- tary politics. A politics of touch is not a new politics but a rearticulation of a movement between, a recomposition of a transrelational acceleration that witnesses certain shifts from a politics of the body to a politics of the BwO. Don’t forget: bodies are also stratiﬁed on the BwO. There is no body that can completely resist the structure.
