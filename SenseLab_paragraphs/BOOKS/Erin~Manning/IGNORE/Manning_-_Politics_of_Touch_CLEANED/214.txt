For Derrida, violence is equivalent to the operation of the trace (1974, 101). The violence referred to here is not the violence that differentiates good and evil, the violence of the loss of innocence and the Fall. Violence understood in Derridean terms is not something that supervenes upon inno- cence to surprise it. Derrida asks: “Is there an experience, and, above all, a language, scientiﬁc or not, that one can call alien at once to writing and to violence?” (1974, 127). The supposition here is that any act between self and other will be textualized, made into a writing, and this making, this very writing, is a violent act. Can one say the same for sensual experiences? Can I suggest that touch, as a movement of desire toward an other, is also a vio- lent writing of the relationship between self and other? Touch inaugurates a violence since it compels us to write the relationship between self and other differently. Does this not imply that any attempt to touch the political is to engage violently with the discourse of politics? I believe that when I reach out to touch you, when you and I create a space-time for our bodies to react reciprocally, we make the decision to acknowledge a certain kind of violence. This violence which I encounter in my desire to touch you is not necessar- ily a violence toward you or toward the spaced time we create through our touch. This violence is symbolized through the entry into the realm of un- knowability. “There is no ethics without the presence of an other, but also, and consequently, without absence, dissimulation, detour, difference, writ- ing. A violent opening” (Derrida 1974, 139).
