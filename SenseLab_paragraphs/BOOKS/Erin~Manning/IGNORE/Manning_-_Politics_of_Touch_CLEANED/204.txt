God’s warning regarding touch is a directive to resist the temptation of the unknowable. For there is a difference, in the Bible, between the injunc- tion made through God not to touch given to the populace, which is always phrased in the conditional, “Then said Haggai, if one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean. And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean” (Hag. 2:13), and the act of touching perpe- trated always by Jesus, which is phrased in the active tenses of the past, present, and future, “And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all” (Luke 6:19). It appears that the only one who is allowed to challenge the unknowable is the savior himself, the one who has been sent to heal us from the unknowable, the one who solves the mysteries of humanity through his miracles.
