Left without Chang in Buenos Aires, Po-Wing no longer actively in his life, Lai-Yu Fai wanders the streets in search of human contact, ﬁnding himself, ultimately, in  a  gay  bathhouse.  Here,  where  the  quiet  partitioned spaces evince their loneliness, Fai realizes that he is no different from other lonely men: “I never liked hanging around in toilets,” he says in a voice- over. “I thought it was dirty. I thought I was different. Turns out that lonely people are all the same.” Po-Wing hovers in the shot. Isolation is embodied in this scene alongside (absent) desire and the craving for contact. Desire propels the body. Without desire, movement slows down and the body becomes heavy, limp, increasingly unreachable. Politics becomes masked behind need as initiative wanes. Touch becomes unthinkable. To touch, an initiative is necessary, and it is this initiative, so essential to love, to friend- ship, to politics, that Fai ﬁnds so impossible to envisage as he makes his way through the bathhouse. Even the blowjob he gives another man in the movie theater seems to be devoid of contact. Fai is hurt, sad, lost, and alone. It is this terrible alone-ness that incites him, once again, to reach for the specter of “home.”
