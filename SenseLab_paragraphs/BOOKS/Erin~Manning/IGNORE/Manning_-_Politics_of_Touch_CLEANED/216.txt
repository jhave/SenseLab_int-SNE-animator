The exfoliant body that reaches across time and space embodies a violence in its resistance to conform to corporeal expressivity, to the signs and codes that are immediately understood as the space and time a body should occupy within the (national) body-politic. When I touch you, what I cannot know is what infra(sensual)language our reciprocal touch will create. Nor can I predict how my touching you will provoke spaced times and timed spaces. Of course, I can never predict the body “itself” either (since there is no such thing as the body always already whole), hence the state’s contin- ual imposition of the “national body-politic” to establish a normative vocabulary of the body to which we agree to conform. Without a stable body there can be no body-politic, and without a body-politic, bodies will not conform, proclaims the state. What touch achieves in opposition to this state-centered dynamic of the body-politic is the potentiality to appre- hend bodies not as containers of preordained individual signiﬁcations, but as orbs continually readjusting themselves to the infralanguages and move- ments of desire through which they interact.
