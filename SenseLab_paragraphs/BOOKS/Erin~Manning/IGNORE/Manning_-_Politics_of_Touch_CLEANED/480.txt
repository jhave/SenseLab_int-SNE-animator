Is this too abstract? Or is it perhaps not abstract enough for the lived abstractness that is the sensing body in movement? We orient through the senses. A discussion of abstractness needs to be predicated on a comprehen- sion of the strangeness of our senses: “The way we orient is more like a tro- pism (tendency plus habit) than a cognition (visual form plus conﬁgura- tion)” (Massumi 2002a, 180). Proprioceptively, kinesthetically, we reach toward an orientation that becomes our worlding of the world. We self-reference, we register, we extend. The relation of position to movement is inverted. “Movement is no longer indexed to position. Rather, position emerges from movement, from a relation of movement to itself” (Massumi 2002a, 180). Touch spaces, instantiating, through movement, a BwO that becomes a dynamic of relation and disagreement between sense-dimensions. Senses fold into one-another creating an in-folding and out-folding, an exfoliation of experience. Touch is an event.
