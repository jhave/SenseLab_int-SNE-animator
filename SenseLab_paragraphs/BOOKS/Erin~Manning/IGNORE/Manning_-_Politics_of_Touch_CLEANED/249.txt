Violence is a mode of transcription, both textual and sensory. Reaching out, I do violence to my interiority. Touching you, I do violence to my-self. Receiving, I cut across time and space violently. Violence circulates from one surface to another, from one space to another, from one body to another, from one space-time to another. History is rewritten through violence, not always as the history of the state-sanctioned practices operating in the name of (in)security, but also as the textures of the body in time and space, a body that is not simply mine, which can never simply be mine, but must also be yours, your skin, your touch. “Struggles,” writes Feldman, “will occur over competing transcriptions of the same body and of different bodies. This contest over adversarial transcripts fractures the body as an ‘organic,’ ‘natural’ object and thus accelerates the body’s subjectivation” (1991, 7). The body cannot operate on “its” own. There is no body (other than the fabulated body of the state) that can operate separately from the chronotopes it creates and crosses. There can be no separation from the body’s marking of an other and the body itself. History is the body. Spacing (espacement) is the body. The body is not political, it is the political instant of space being created in time now.
