Politics of Touch rests on the originary assumption that there is no such thing as a body that is not relational. Bodies individuate in response to a reaching-toward and they reach toward as a response to their individuation. At its most political, to reach toward is to create a concept for unthinking the individual as a discrete entity. Sensing bodies in movement are not indi- vidual bodies; their individuations are always collective. They are worlding bodies that are one with the potential of movement. To become is to move toward something that is not yet. To exist in the not-yet is to individuate incorporeally or virtually. This shift toward the virtual does not preclude actualization, it suggests that to reach toward is to engage with what Deleuze calls the crystallization of time,4 where the actual and the virtual coincide. Touch occurs at the intersections of the prism, creating a relation that is actual while ﬂirting with the future anterior, the “will have come.” The future anterior is dealt with in more detail in chapter 5, where I explore the ways in which democracy remains to-come.
