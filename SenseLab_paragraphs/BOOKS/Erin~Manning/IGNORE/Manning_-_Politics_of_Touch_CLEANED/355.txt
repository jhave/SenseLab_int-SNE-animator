A politics of touch engages a milieu that is continually under construc- tion. This milieu is incorporeal in the sense that it does not exist except in the relation that will emerge through individuations that have not yet ma-  terialized. This milieu is as much a transitory location as a spring board for individuations to occur not at the level of the individual body, but in rela- tion. This milieu is an energetic force ﬁeld that constitutes form and matter beyond notions of internal and external pre-conﬁgurations. Symbiosis of matter and form emerge relationally. This calls forth engenderings. The engendering body is a body not only in relation but of relation. Relation is activity, intensity, movement toward. Engendering is an event through which emergent bodies take form.
