Our skins are being designed even as we speak. Bodies, skins, politics, democ- racy are always already technological. To think of the relation between skins, bodies, and senses, we must become comfortable with the logic of the prosthesis. Touch, I would like to suggest, is a certain prosthesis not only of politics, but of the body itself. While the prosthetic7 emerges as a current concept in new technologies and will be discussed as such here, it is impor- tant to underline the fact that I refer to prosthesis not as a way of situating a post-technological body but in an effort to locate the body as always-already technological.
