This is the Garden as it would perhaps look to Adam and Eve were they to return to Eden. To their eyes, it would be a bleak sight. Open ﬁelds replaced by a locked chapel. The abundant nature no longer visible, having been overtaken by the stern architecture that underwrites the commitment to eternity. The gates shut so that only the soul can cross the threshold. The touching, sensing, moving body condemned: “Thou shalt not” written on the door of the chapel. Fields of ﬂowers replaced by graves and grave priests binding into briars the lost joys of the garden. This garden, seen through eyes that have touched the world, would be a startling vision of hell.
