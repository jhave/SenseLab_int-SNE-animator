The BwO does not exist in opposition. It “is” not “against” the organism. But it does defy the “organism.” The BwO is the revolt we can never quite hold back, the excess of the ﬂesh, the senses intermingling synesthetically at the contours of our forms, the matter that concerns us, the individuation that calls forth a difference we cannot subsume within strict categorization. The BwO is contrary, but not dichotomous. It is contrary because it is resist- ant. It is resistant because it will not ﬁt the system, because there is no sys- tem to be called forth once the organism has been disseminated. The BwO is a telling adventure: the exploration of terminologies that fall apart as soon as they are touched, like old skeletons disappearing into small mounds of dust at the touch of my hand. There is no body. There is no sovereign. There is nothing that is secure. Is this possible?
No. There must always be a God, a priest, a king, a mother. Sovereignty reigns, but only insofar as the singular body continues to be upheld in the name of the body-politic: sovereignty needs to identify the body, if only to destroy it in the name of the state of exception.5 Judgment precedes bodies. Habits form bodies. Control regulates security and security regulates con- trol. Bodies navigate between these vectors, displaying all the talents of organization bodies are reputed to obey. But they smell. They sweat. They desire. Despite themselves, bodies are always “too much,” always excessive, always, in some sense, uncontrollable, unsecurable. Even dead, they decom- pose, infested, digested. Organisms are made and dismantled, organized and categorized, understood and comprehended, discarded. But bodies are pro- ductively inﬁnite.
