The camera frames Chang, alone, on top of the world, the blue sky radiant behind and above him. Later, Chang searches for Fai in Buenos Aires, to no avail: “The night before I leave for Taipei, I come back to Buenos Aires. I want to say goodbye to Fai. Nobody knows where he is. I thought I’d hear his voice here. Maybe the music’s too loud. I can’t hear anything.” Chang still tries to hear Fai, he believes contact is possible. And he’s right: the next shot shows Fai in Taipei, searching for Chang.
Friendship is not a telos. Desire prevails as the moment of uncertainty whose gap in space and time we cherish, whose politics we acclaim as the point of departure, of disagreement, of sensation, of hope. “If man has friends,” writes Derrida, “if he desires friends, it is because man thinks and thinks an other” (1997, 224).
