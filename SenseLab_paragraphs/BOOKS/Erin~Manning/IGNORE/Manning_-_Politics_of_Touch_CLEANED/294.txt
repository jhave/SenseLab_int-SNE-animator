Language plays a key role in the sexing (and de-sexing) of bodies, organiz- ing the domain of signiﬁcability or intelligibility. The materiality of the sign is what is at stake for Butler: it is through materiality that she is capable of positing bodies as adjacent to linguistic signiﬁcation. In this chapter, I will expand on this notion of materiality, suggesting that what a body can do exceeds linguistic signiﬁcation. A politics of touch ampliﬁed through the prism of engendering asks questions concerning gender that broaden the problematic initiated by Butler in Bodies That Matter. While I do not dis- pute the fact that language is central to politics,2 my focus here will be on the ways in which bodies touch at language’s sensual limits. Remaining concerned with the dynamics of relation, I will focus mainly on the ways in which touch exceeds language’s signiﬁcability.
