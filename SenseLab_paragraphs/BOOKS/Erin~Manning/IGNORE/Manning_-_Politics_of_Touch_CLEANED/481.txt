Movement precedes sense. Sensing is prosthetic: sense instantiates a BwO that afﬁrms that experience comes to it prosthetically, through move- ment.7 Prosthetically, senses stimulate worlds, which in turn activate bodies. When we think of touch this way, we challenge meaning-producing prac- tices of knowledge and information that are considered “innate” to the body. Experience is animated by the senses, sensing. Experience implicates the senses, worlding the body. Experience expresses the event that produces my BwO. I sense prosthetically, extending my body intensely toward the un- touchable. What I sense is always an expression of potential. In potentia, my BwO creates sense vectors, prosthetically reaching out toward the world we create through touch. A politics of touch depends upon the BwO as much as the BwO depends on a politics of touch. This is not necessarily reassuring: not all BwO are capable of forming pathways for intensities required for a radical politics. Not all bodies are willing to risk.
