Gilbert Simondon’s work is a rich engagement with the complexity of engendering matter and form. Individuation is the term he gives to the process through which potentiality is engendered. For Simondon, individuation implies a leaving-behind of the concept of the individual as the pre-organized sum of stable form and inert matter. Identity is exposed by individuation as a moment in a process that expands far beyond the bounds of a strict cate- gory one might call the “self.” Individuation is conceptualized as a vehicle that allows being to become, not as matter or form or substance, but as a tensile system, oversaturated with its own potential. Individuation has not yet been adequately thought, Simondon suggests, because a sole form of equi- librium has been foregrounded that has privileged stability over metastability. Metastability is linked to individuation. Whereas stability refers to a system in equilibrium, metastability speaks of a system that is far from equilibrium5 (but precariously stable), a system through which potential energy is unleashed. Individuation allows us to explore relation as a becoming that is far-from- equilibrium, that can be modiﬁed by potential energy. This potential energy, Simondon suggests, emerges through matter and form, emanating from a level where matter and form are not yet distinct.
