Touching is the thought of the medium without limit, the singularly un-absolute.
The absolute limit is instated by a politics that is sustained by the myth of the secure border. This limit concept that is at the heart of the state sys- tem is structured as an injunction to combine parts of a corpus into a whole. Yet there is no whole, no totality of the body: there is no such thing as the body. There are corpuses, many of them, reaching out, touching, being touched, corpuses that are recitations of multiplicities, of pluralities evoked by touching bodies. These corpuses are political potentialities, acts in the making, movements toward an other. Despite the incantations of the state, there is no completely docile body. There is only the policing of a corpus that writes the body as docile.
