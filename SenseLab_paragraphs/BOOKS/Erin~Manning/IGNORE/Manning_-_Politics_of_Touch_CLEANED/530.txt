Joy corresponds to the relation between active series and what is invariant between them. This noncausal correspondence speaks to resonances between bodies in-formation. Expression is engaging, even when it is challenging. Expression is the Nietzschean afﬁrmation. Expression is a noncausal correspondence because it relates to what expresses itself as distinct from expression itself. A politics of touch embodies a multiple movement that navigates between the expresser and the expressed, between the expresser and expression. A spiral movement: eternal return. A politics of touch expresses in such a way as to always intervene in the imaginary process of Aufhebung. There is no synthesis: “what is expressed is discovered as a third term that makes distinctions inﬁnitely more real and identity inﬁnitely bet- ter thought. What is expressed is sense: deeper than the relation of causality, deeper than the relation of representation” (Deleuze 1990a, 335).
