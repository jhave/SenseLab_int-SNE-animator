Friendship understood in these terms foregrounds opposition rather than emphasizing the ﬁgure of the one-more that qualiﬁes the politics of friendship we have been discussing so far. Questioning this need for the enemy within a political understanding of friendship, Derrida asks: “Is there another thought of calculation and of number, another way of apprehending the universality of the singular which, without dooming politics to the incalculable, would still justify the old name of democracy?” (1997, 104). The question of the count, of the one more, is an essential question if we are to arrive at a reading and a writing of democracy that does not return to Schmitt’s dichotomy, if we are to understand politics as that which is no longer necessarily constitutive of terms such as nation, state or citizen. For it is apparent that for Schmitt the question of friend and enemy cannot be thought separately from the state, and more particularly, the state of exception.
