“Because to touch... is to allow myself to be touched by touch... by the ‘ﬂesh’ that I touch and that becomes touching as well as touched” (Derrida 2000, 312). A politics of touch touches touch. This touch remains incalculable: touch evokes dissymmetry, reminding me that politics, like all world- ings, must remain uncertain, uncountable. Yet, as Nancy writes, “we must not give ‘touch’ credit too easily, and we must especially not believe that we could touch the sense of what it means to touch” (1992, 13). To touch is to excribe touch, as a verb, as a terminology, to deﬂect and question its inser- tion in a vocabulary that would seek to stabilize politics and/as the body once more. To touch is to acknowledge that I must also be touched by you in order to touch you. “In the ‘touching you(r)self’ (se toucher toi) the ‘self’ is as indispensable as the ‘you’” (Derrida 2000, 326).
Tango is evoked through a politics of touch that resides in the intent lis- tening to(ward) an other. This attention to a gesture carried within the movements of the body is a listening that carves space in time with our sensing bodies in movement. In the best cases, there is not one dance to be danced, but a myriad of possibilities generated by two bodies, often foreign to one another, touching one another. I lead, you follow, yet even as I lead, I follow your response, intrigued by the manner in which we interpret one another, surprised at the intentness with which our bodies respond to each other.
