For Balibar, “what the pact institutes is a collective power that assumes after the fact the form of a relation between wills” (in Montag and Stolze 1997, 187). This suggests that wills do not exist before the formation of the pact, that the pact itself involves the formation of a will, or better, the per- petual trans-formation of the will of the multitude. “Theoretically speaking, individual or collective wills do not exist before the pact but are consti- tuted under its effect, this very effect that places the summa potestas in the place in which the law that must be observed is stated” (Balibar in Montag and Stolze 1997, 187). The will is a retroactive effect of the pact, a conse- quence of a decision. The will exposes a directionality already decided upon in the writing of the pact. Yet the will does not dissolve with the passing of the pact because it in-forms the writing of the next pact. In this regard, it is not as transitory as the pact itself. The will continues to shift, to pre-exist the next pact, yet only coming into itself with the subsequent re-writing of the becoming-pact. There is no individual will, therefore. The will is a vector, an intensity, a connectiveness that gives power (potestas) to the directionality of the reaching-toward.
