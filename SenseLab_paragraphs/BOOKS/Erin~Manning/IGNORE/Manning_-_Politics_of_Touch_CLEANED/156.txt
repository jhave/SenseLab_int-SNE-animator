The scenes that follow are all colored with the same paradox of the imprint of national vocabularies of belonging on a world that resists being fashioned strictly along territorial lines. Fai seeks an ultimate sense of belonging, which he can only achieve by imprisoning Po-Wing within his web of caretaking. Toward this end, he increases Po-Wing’s dependence on him by stealing his passport and refusing to let him leave the apartment. Po-Wing, with his bandaged hands, somehow represents for Fai the lost home—as much the image of a lost love as of a lost nation: impossible, ungraspable, bandaged. Paradoxically, even as he is caged into Fai’s bondage- house of deceit, it is Po-Wing, despite his faults (his lack of continuity in the friendship and love affair, his promiscuity), who ﬁnally teaches Fai the lesson that the home will remain ungraspable as a stable entity. He teaches Fai tango. However, this is not something Fai can learn, not yet. Lai-Yu Fai must retain the upper hand, but at an incredible loss, the loss of a friend and a lover, as well as the ultimate loss of the dream of home, though that doesn’t sink in until much later.
