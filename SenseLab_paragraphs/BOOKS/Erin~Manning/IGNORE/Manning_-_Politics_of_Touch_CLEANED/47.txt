The incorporeal is like a smudge that emanates from your body’s poten- tial movement. The smudge exfoliates in all directions, leaving traces of the potential of the animated body as it moves from here to there, from thnow to the not-yet, from the after to the before to the will-have-come. The incorporeal is not the opposite of the corporeal. It is a stage of corporeality that reminds us that the corporeal is only ever virtually concrete. The body is always what it has not yet become. The body is in metamorphosis. This is the subject of chapter 3, which explores the ways in which the Bible narrates this metamorphosis in the name of touch. In a reading of violence and touch, chapter 3 foregrounds the metamorphosis of the exfoliating body, suggesting that a violence associated with a politics of touch may not concur with the biblical opposition between good and evil. To exfoliate implies shedding layers of skin. It also suggests a process of renewal and transition. To become a body is to alter all conceptions of what a body “is.” Violence here becomes a way of exploring the consequences of invention.
