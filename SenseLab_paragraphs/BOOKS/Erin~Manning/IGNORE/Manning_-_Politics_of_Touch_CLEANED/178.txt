Massumi suggests that “sensation is the registering of the multiplicity of potential connections in the singularity of a connection already under way. It is the direct experience of a more to the less of every perception.... [I]t is a limit of experience immanent to every step along the continuum” (2002a, 93). Sensation is multiplicitous, multi-identiﬁcatory, multifaceted. There is never linearity in sensation: we have all experienced the way a sound can lead to a smell, to a memory of a touch, to a taste. The senses combine, lay- ered, infused into one into another. Sensation, this movement of reaching- toward, lies at the basis of a politics of friendship that would no longer be a dichotomous practice functioning as a democratic moment of ﬁliation, but a composite event, an emergence that leaves our senses peaked. “Sensation is the point of co-conversion through which the variations of perception and thought play-out. It is the singular point where what unfolds is also unfolding” (Massumi 2002a, 94).
