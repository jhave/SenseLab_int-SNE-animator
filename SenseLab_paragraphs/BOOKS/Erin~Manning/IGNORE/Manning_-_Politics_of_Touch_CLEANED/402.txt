The virtual here refers to an ethics of emergence in which a recursive futurity is expressed. Deleuze and Guattari suggest that ethico-aesthetic practices can access virtual forces by foregrounding expression’s momentum. When time is evoked as a reaching toward, we express ourselves through an eventness that is virtual. When the world is conceived of as an inﬁnite series of folds or differentials— when my body is no longer “mine” but multiplied with myriad prostheses aligned with various forces such as the senses—a permeation occurs that upsets the “balance” between the inside and the outside. Relations are created that cannot be predicted. Prophesies are rela- tional. Relations are generative.
