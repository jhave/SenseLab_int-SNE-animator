Rifts in time can constitute political moments. Rifts in time indicate the incalculability and incommensurability of democratic equality. Democratic equality is uncountable: it is the touch I will never be able to encapsulate within a system of capitalist exchange. As Derrida writes about democracy: “This equality in freedom no longer has anything to do with numerical equality or equality according to worth, proportion or logos. It is itself an incalculable and incommensurable equality; it is the unconditional condi- tion of freedom, its sharing, if you will” (2005, 49). Equality as the uncount- able attracts, absorbs, and deﬂects the possible, engendering potential stakes at each juncture. It is not an equality that stabilizes the relation by rendering it accountable (in terms of gender, race, ethnicity, class), but an individua- tion that foregrounds the aporia at work within a concept of the political. What is initiated by the aporia is a thinking of justice. Equality, within a democracy-to-come, is a demand for an idea of freedom that would expand beyond the count itself. In aporetic space-time an opening is made for a relation that functions according to the n+1. To count (to account for) is both to count again and to add to the count. This multiplication process requires a response. The ability to respond propels not the closure of the aporia but its continual reopenings. The time of democracy must remain
aporetic.
