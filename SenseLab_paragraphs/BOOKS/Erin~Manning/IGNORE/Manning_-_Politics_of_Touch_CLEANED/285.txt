To live sensually is to discover the inﬁnite in all things and to be persuaded by our beliefs. Nothing can be proven; there is no truth. Sensual enjoyment leads to eternity, an eternity that exists in ﬁnitude, analogous, perhaps, to Nietzsche’s concept of eternal recurrence. Knowledge is corro- sive, printed onto a surface which always resists. Perception must be cleansed. Only the senses offer the window onto a ﬁnitude replete with experience. The printing house becomes the location for the Word, a Word that does not uphold the voice of the sovereign but seeks instead to etch corrosively on opaque metals and transfer its remains onto translucent paper. Blake’s word transforms experience by incorporating the sensual capacities of sensing bodies in movement, relating the narratives of super-sensory giants who are now imprisoned. Sensuality that is restrained to the surface must escape, must become Godly, must expand beyond the strict envelope of the body’s skin. “God only Acts & Is, in existing beings of Men” (1975, 16–17, xxiii). “For every thing that lives is Holy,” writes Blake at the end of The Mar- riage of Heaven and Hell (1975, 27, xxviii). Holiness is not bodilessness but its opposite. The more sense-perceptive, the holier. The body that emerges as the holy body is a body that is eminently touchable, though always slightly out of reach as it extends toward the world. The body is ﬂuidly sensual, sensingly ﬂuid, transforming itself beyond notions of discrete insides and outsides. The body is beside itself, corporeal, reaching, sensing, experiencing. This is not an innocent or a nonviolent body. It is a body that experi- ences the world in touch with the potential violence that is the rupture toward the unknowable. As Blake writes in Jerusalem, “if Perceptive Organs vary: Objects of Perception seem to vary: / if the Perceptive Organs close: the Objects seem to close also” (1991b, 30, 34). The world corresponds to
the variations of the senses that perceive it.
