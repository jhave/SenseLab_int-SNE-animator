A critique of violence embodied through a politics of touch engages in the interstices of violence where violence does not seek to uphold law but to creatively propel contradictory readings of juxtaposition and relation. Critiques of violence will remain violent, with the goal of producing a concept of violence that escapes the strict dichotomy between law-making and law- preserving violence. I denounce violence while negotiating the violence of the denunciation. The question is: Can I do so without mobilizing a violence of my own that projects a new kind of founding violence?
