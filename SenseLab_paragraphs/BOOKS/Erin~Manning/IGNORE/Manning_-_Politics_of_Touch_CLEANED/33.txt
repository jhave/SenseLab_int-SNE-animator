In the varied works over many centuries that explore the senses, the body is regularly theorized in opposition to the mind, while the senses are located strictly in the body. And yet there is a suspicion already within these formative texts that the strict delineation of the sensing body in opposition to the rational mind is less stable than it has been made out to be in the canonical readings of these texts. Already in many of these works—includ- ing those of Descartes—the senses emerge as slippery concepts that compli- cate the pre-imposed discreteness of the body. The body, these texts seem to say, is always in excess of our understanding. This is the point of departure for Politics of Touch. What I propose to do is to contribute to a long tradition of dis-placing the body in relation to the senses.2 I suggest that to think the body in relation to the senses is to: (1) encourage a thinking of the body in movement; (2) engage with the possibility that bodies are not limited to their organs; (3) shift the question of “what the body is” to “what can a body do.” My engagement with touch is not an exploration of something I could strictly deﬁne as sensing per se but an encounter with the atypical expressions of a sensing body in movement.
