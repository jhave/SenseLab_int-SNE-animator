To touch is a prosthetic gesture. It is prosthetic because it is associated with a surplus or excess of the biological organism. Touch involves a departure from my organs as organs. Touch is a movement-toward that relates my body to the excess of your body. My body is always more than one. This relation cannot simply be thought as a skin-to-skin encounter. Certainly, often I touch skin. But the untouchability inspired by my desire to touch is based on the fact that you are reaching from my body as much as I am reaching from yours. Together we become prosthetically entwined. We touch an incorporeal body that is created through our reaching-toward. This body does not pre-exist the relation. Touch is a prosthesis through which our bodies make contact. Touch is the manner in which I navigate from a subject posi- tion (an imagined stability) to an in-betweenness where the line between you and me becomes blurred. To touch is to become posthuman.
