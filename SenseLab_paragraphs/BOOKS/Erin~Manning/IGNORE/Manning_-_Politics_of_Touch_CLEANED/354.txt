Inside and outside are not delimited within the concept of relation. Relation occurs in-between, at the interstices between the spaces and times created by bodies as they reach toward one another. Relation operates in the future anterior (the tense of the “will have” and of the “not yet”). The vocabulary of the future anterior is a vocabulary that calls forth an articula- tion of the political that departs from the stabilizing narratives of the nation- state, in which space and time remain overdetermined by the categories of geography and history subsumed to territory and identity. To conceptualize gender as operative within a vocabulary of the not-yet (or not quite yet) is to begin to think gender as engendering and bodies as mechanisms for the rethinking of time and space.
