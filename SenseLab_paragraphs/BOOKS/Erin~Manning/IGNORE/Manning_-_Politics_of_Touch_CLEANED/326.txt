The alliance between reproduction and individual difference is at the heart of Darwin’s theory of “modiﬁcation and descent” in which every indi- vidual being is considered as part of a genealogy of beings open to variations through breeding and species intercrossing. In this model, individual differ- ences are slight modiﬁcations of a common pool of variations preserved through adaptation and sexual mating. Natural selection focuses on the stability of a species. Sexual mating within this system guarantees the preservation of a lineage (branching phylogeny). Difference is considered a necessary tool for survival but only insofar as that divergence remains located within the spectrum of adaptation and transmission of variation. Meiotic sex, understood as sexual reproduction by two (usually male-female) parties, preserves variations and sustains the principle of inheritance.13 This line of evolutionary thought—extending from Darwin to neo-Darwinism—argues that external factors are not direct causes of changes inheritable through ﬁlial generation. Genetic information is passed on unidirectionally, includ- ing feedback loops between environments and genders. This suggests that the potential for variation is built into the organism as part of its heritage, afﬁrming that modiﬁcation is safely contained within the germ-plasm. One implication of Darwinian and neo-Darwinian thought is that sexed difference remains dependent on meiosis or sexual reproduction.
