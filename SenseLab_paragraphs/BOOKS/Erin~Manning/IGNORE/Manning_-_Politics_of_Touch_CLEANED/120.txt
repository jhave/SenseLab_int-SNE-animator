Wong Kar Wai’s Happy Together begins with a silent red screen. Passports are stamped with an entry into a different space, not Hong Kong but Buenos Aires. We are introduced to the refrain of the ﬁlm: “Let’s start over.” This is May 1995, and two men, Lai-Yu Fai and Po-Wing, are making their way toward a place of improvisation—the world of tango—to challenge the possibilities of reinvention. Shifting from color to black and white, this ﬁrst scene of the ﬁlm is narrated by Lai-Yu Fai’s voice-over: “Ho Po-Wing always says, ‘Let’s start over,’ and it gets to me every time. We have been together for a while and broken up often. But when he says start over, I ﬁnd myself back with him. We left Hong Kong to start over. We hit the road and reached Argentina.”
