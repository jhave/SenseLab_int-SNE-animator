This is where tango comes in, not as a dance in which we must partake in order to recognize the workings of a politics of touch (that would be an exoticization of this rearticulation of the political), but as an example of one of the potential counter-movements of politics today. There are other examples, certainly, including the transgressions of time and space initiated by friends, lovers, and strangers every day. Tango is but a rich enunciation of what might be sought after by those who seek to transgress boundaries of self and other, immigrant and national, homed and homeless, by those who would like to resist the political stagnancy of state politics and inaugurate a politics that might begin to acknowledge (and sense) our bodies differently. Tango is often exoticized (both by those regarding from the outside and those dancing) precisely because it threatens the organizing of social and political locales that depend on national and state limits of identity and ter- ritory. This is why within nation-state vocabularies of identity and territory, tango will continue to be located as the Argentinean dance of national identity, as the stable rendition of passion and loss experienced by immi- grants to Buenos Aires in the early twentieth century and embodied today by many Argentines, in particular the porte√±os of Buenos Aires.
