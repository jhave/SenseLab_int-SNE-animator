This article came to my attention late in the process of writing Politics of Touch. I foreground it now because it suggests that interesting new research on the senses is under way, and it allows me to make explicit the tools re- quired to rearticulate the relation between bodies and senses. It also empha- sizes my own progression as regards the project of Politics of Touch. When I began writing this book, ﬁnding work on the senses was such a challenge that I welcomed anything I could lay my hands on. Had I encountered the article three years previous, I would have been especially encouraged because the research demonstrates a qualitative change in bodies as a result of touch. At the time—in what I considered to be a disembodied political climate where political philosophy was completely disinterested in the senses—any research on the senses was welcome. Today —having located the senses in all kindsof peripheral environments and no longer expecting research on the senses to provide a straightforward re-articulation of the body-politic—I ﬁnd the intriguing aspects of the study constrained by a research methodology that continues to situate the senses within a model of the body that is gendered and codiﬁed, a model reminiscent of the one Politics of Touch attempts to write against.
