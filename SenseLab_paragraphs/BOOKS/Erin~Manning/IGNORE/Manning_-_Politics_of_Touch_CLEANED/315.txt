Classiﬁcations presuppose hierarchical relationships. In positing gender as a principle of strict differentiation, form is placed onto matter in a way that calls forth a complete individual rather than an individuation. Engendering is a reaching toward matter-form that explores the manner in which the quality of matter is already a source of form. What we consider a unique form (my body as woman, for example) is but the latest episode in a series of trans-formations. Matter is material because it can be modeled in ways that stabilize its de-formation. Pure form already contains gestures11 through which matter can mutate. This suggests that no body is pre-formed with con- crete matter. Engendering precedes gender.
If we take into consideration the micropractices of engendering, we can imagine life as an emergent property of complex autopoetic systems involv- ing nonlinear feedback and combinatory processes. Engendering—as sym- biotic becoming—plays a role in the discourse of reproduction from the  autocatalytic association of cells to the association of multicellular bodies, from societies of bacteria to social domains of disciplinary sex, from digital cultures of cloning images to bio-technological proliferations of cellular engineering.
