Friendship is also loss, the multiplicity of singularities and the singularity of multiplicities, the impossibility of a future without a present. There is never a sole friend. Friendship cannot be calculated. This is politics, a politics of friendship: in politics, calculation cannot happen in advance. A politics of friendship is akin to what Derrida terms “destinerrancy,” a movement with- out destination, a politics without end. A politics of friendship is about dis- agreement, about misunderstanding, about the necessity to listen in order to be heard in order to listen again. A politics of friendship is alive through the touch of an-other, embodying the insatiability of my need to reach out toward you, to touch your singularity, my difference, to make con-tact with you. “The crucial experience of the perhaps,” writes Derrida, “imposed by the undecidable — that is to say, the condition of decision — is not a moment to be exceeded, forgotten or suppressed. It continues to constitute the deci- sion as such . . .” (1997, 219). Response-ability carries within itself an ethics of contact, of response, a necessity to cross the space-time between me and you, even perhaps to do violence to space and time in order to be certain that movement is what is at stake. Without movement, there is no capacity to respond, to touch, to be a friend. How can I be responsive if I do not reach out toward you?
