And so I began work on Volumetrics, Phase 2 of Folds to Infinity. And as I did so, I realized that at the McCord Museum I fell into my own trap: I created a structure. And the very same structure remained at the end, denuded but not transformed. We must never underestimate the power of existing struc- tures to predetermine the proto-architectural field.
Choreography as mobile architecture is anathema to any kind of setting into place of ideal conditions that transcend event-time, be they those of structure, of object, or of individual. Choreography as mobile architecture emerges instead with the diagrammatic force of ideas in the materializing. It has to do with force taking form. All incipient architecting of mobility is already a volumetrics, an intercalating of surfaces and tendencies. As mo- bile architecture, choreography activates the volumes, turning the surface onto itself, making felt the coming into appearance of the eventâ€™s own ver- tiginous movements, incipient movements that stay with us long after the particular occasion of their coming to expression has unraveled.
