Feeling
A life does not come once and for all on the scene of the actual. It resonates on the cusp of the living, affective in tone. A life is experienced as the feeling of life welling across its dephasings. Think feeling here in the Whiteheadian sense, as propulsor to experience, always in the realm of the impersonal.
This is not human feeling or emotion. It is affective tonality. It is the gen- erative force, singular to this event, that moves the event toward its reso- lution. Each occasion has a tone, a singular expressivity, an enjoyment, as Whitehead would say. A life is how the preindividual returns as feeling onto life’s topological surface of becoming.
Whitehead’s notion of feeling is allied to the Spinozean/Deleuzo- Guattarian notion of affect, both of which are intimately connected to the concept of a life and to the preindividual. What I like about the concept of feeling is that it reminds us not to place affect within a schema of lin- ear phases and already-formed bodies. Feeling is not attached to a form already-taken, nor is it an afterthought to a preexisting process. Feeling is how an occasion enjoys its coming into what Whitehead calls “subjective form.” Feeling is the force that moves an event to reach its concrescence. Feeling is also what outlives it, always still resonating.
This suggests that any process that occasions this or that experience must be motivated by a certain affective quality. This affective quality is a feeling- with that colors experience in the making. There is no body-emergent sepa- rate from the quality of its emergence.
