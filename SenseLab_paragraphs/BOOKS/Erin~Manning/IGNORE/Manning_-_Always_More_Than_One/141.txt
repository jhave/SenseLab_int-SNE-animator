Diagrammatic Praxis
To activate this political potential, a rigorous procedurality is necessary. I turn here to the conceptual artists/architects Arakawa and Gins because of their use of procedures as a diagrammatic praxis.
“Step 1: So as to discover what most urgently needs to be made to be otherwise, take a long, boldly uncompromising look at what goes on as (an) organism that persons (human being).4 . . . [I]t is the task of those who would produce architectural pro- cedures to augment the bioscleave, the insufficiently procedural bioscleave, and thereby recast it” (Arakawa and Gins 2003, 11).
