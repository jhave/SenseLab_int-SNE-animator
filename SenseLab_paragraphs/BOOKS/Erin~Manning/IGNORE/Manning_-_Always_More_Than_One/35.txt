In the beginning was movement. There was no rest because there was no cessation of move- ment. Rest was only an image that was too vast of what moved, an infinitely tired image that slowed movement down. In order to rest, we enlarged ourselves, we confused the issue, gathered
up space, and unified time into a present that seemed to be everywhere, forever, at once. We breathed a sigh of relief, thinking we’d attained immobility. Finally we saw ourselves within a soothing image of self and world but this was forgetting the movement that continued silently, deep within our bodies. Microscopically. For how would it be possible to pass from rest to move- ment if movement did not already exist within rest? At the beginning, therefore, there was no beginning.
