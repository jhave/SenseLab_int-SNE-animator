thinking that activates the more-than of the physical form, of the body pre- composed, thinking it into act. A thinking that activates not only the more- than of this movement’s potential, but also the more-than of this or that body. A thinking because the doing resonates with thought. To move is to think-with a bodying in act.
To move thought is to compose with the extrusion of form, to create a body from the oversaturation of what is recognized as this or that displace- ment. This is what dance makes clear: it is not the displacement as such that makes the difference, but the quality of becoming of the micromovements and microperceptions that pass through not just the composing body but also the vibrating space of thought. Because in order for the more-than to be felt it must make the body vibratory, it must make the body a force for thought in the moving, unfastening the body from what we perceive as its integrity. It must create a differentiation, an involution, a fold, a setting-to- rhythm not only of this or that body, but of an ecology in co-composition, an ecology that is not only a recomposition of spacetimes bodying, but also a thinking in act, a movement of thought.
When movement dances in the dancing, what we experience is a lived extraction from the plane of immanence that is total movement, leaving us in the vibration of what is beyond the predetermined body, in the realm of movement-thinking. And it is here, in the thinking in act of movement- moving, that movement begins to compose (us).
