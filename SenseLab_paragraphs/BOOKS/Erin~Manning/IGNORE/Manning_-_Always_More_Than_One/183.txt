a component in the experience of the subject, with an affective tone drawn from this object and toward it” (1967, 176). Subjects and objects edge into experience, relationally. Not human-relationally but in an incipient relation that speciates.
The in-itselfness of the object (or the animal) must be resisted as strongly as the in-itselfness of the human. Neither human nor object nor animal comes to experience fully-formed. It is the counterpoint of their specia- tions that is at stake in experience. This, it seems to me, is what can be taken wholesale from Kanzi and Prince’s dance: speciations connect, cut- ting transversally across all genera, meeting at the level of intensities, mo- tifs, creating styles, in the moving. An ecology of practices. A mode of exis- tence. An activist philosophy.
Dawn Prince (2010) writes: “I hope that autistic people, and others that have been beyond understanding until recently, will be the natural inter- preters of an important patois.” The patois of which Prince speaks is a lan- guage replete with the sensitivity of autistic perception, thick with a force of thought in the middling of its expressibility, textured by a more-than of future movements and unchunked experiences, ripe for the infralinguis- tic telling. The incomplete answer to “are you a gorilla?” is spoken in such a patois, a language that can only be heard in the moving, in the infra of positioning, in the choreographic thinking that is always in the beyond of subject and object.
This is the challenge: To move in counterpoint with a language that trembles on the edges of understanding. To become as “autistically percep- tive” as possible, even at the risk of losing our footing in a species-oriented world—and gaining our footing in a world of speciation. To participate in the concern for another regard.
