Choreography asks: What else? What else can the event do?
Choreography happens everywhere, all the time. The setting up of a room for the enjoyment of a household involves the creation of a movement con- stellation. It crafts opportunities for moving-through, creates invitations for sitting-with, provides incentive for getting-there-first. It forecasts an ideal place-taking: the perfect chair, the best view, the closest comfort. And it creates opportunities for difference: you can walk around the chair, dance on the couch, sleep under the television. Chances are, though, that your movements will take the space-as-is for granted, that you will return to the comfort of the position you prefer, that in time you will realize there are whole areas of the room you never really attend to. Habits set in. Even the cat is always in the same place.
Such everyday choreographies highlight autonomous expressions of movement in the making but are not necessarily creative of new oppor- tunities. In a habitual environment, contrast is generally understated: the status quo tends to delimit the range of potential experience. Creative au- tonomous opportunities are more likely to happen when an event alters how you experience space. You may decide to paint the room, taking out the furniture, only to realize that the orientation you’ve always taken in the space is not the most interesting one. It’s not its objects that have kept you from attending to spacetimes of creation in this particular environment. It’s that you forgot that objects have a life, that they create space. And that how the space moves you is synonymous with the eventness of its objects. In redecorating the room, perhaps you begin to pay more attention to how
the objects create space, not simply how they configure the pattern of an already existing spacetime of experience. Objects are not stable: they fore- cast the time of the event.
