tion the dephasing occasions catapults the becoming-body into a new com- plex of process, the definition of a body cannot be reduced to its momentary taking-form.
More-than its taking-form, “body” is an ecology of processes (and prac- tices, as Isabelle Stengers might say) always in co-constellation with the en- vironmentality of which it is part. A body is a node of relational process, not a form per se. A body is a complex activated through phases in collision and collusion, phasings in and out of processes of individuation that are trans- formed—transduced—to create new iterations not of what a body is but of what a body can do. What we tend to call “body” and what is experienced as the wholeness of a form is simply one remarkable point, one instance of a collusion materializing as this or that.
This is why Simondon rejects hylomorphism: hylomorphism’s claim that there is a hierarchy of form over matter discredits both the processual and the becoming of continuity. The nowness of an individuation momentarily resolving itself into this or that is only a fleeting point within a larger pro- cess of individuation that has not yet claimed a stable relationship between matter and form. A body in the extended sense is the complexity of a multi- plicity of the phasings that co-constitutes it, a society in motion, a resonant materiality, a metastable field. Continuity and discontinuity commingling to activate the singular in a field of difference.
