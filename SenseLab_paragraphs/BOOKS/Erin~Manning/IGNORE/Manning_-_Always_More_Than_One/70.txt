concerto playing uninterrupted, the missile’s sudden hit causing the sol- diers to fall forward in a collective choreography of bodies lowering, their faces still impassive (see figure 5). Then, in unison, the soldiers raise their faces and continue to move forward, crouching along the ground, crawling off into the distance.22
This music video is yet another fissure in the surface of the film, the tran- scendental field now imbued with a new sense of danger—the danger of the unthinkable limit between silence, beauty, and death as it moves not in the soldiers’ individual bodies but across the shifting surfaces of their collec- tive becoming-body. Despite appearances, this is not an aestheticization of death, not a microfascist tendency to “let art flourish—and the world pass away” (Benjamin 2002 [1936], 122).23 For such an aestheticization would privilege the individual, the One. Death is everywhere here, but in the more- than: it is felt in the tense attention of the killing field, in the shadows of the forest becoming cemetery, in the collective becoming-body of the bio- grammatic surface of the transcendental field where memory and forget- ting, movement and rest, beauty and terror coincide. The music video is not an aestheticization of death but the calling forth of the uncanny between out of which the then-now of experience emerges. It is active in the relation, in the movement of sound and color, its bodying choreographed as collec- tive, its protopolitics felt as the very edge where the terror of war is most ineffable and the memory of its violence most ungraspable. It is in this re- lation, in the collective movement of the transcendental surface, that the
welling of the political at its bare-active limit makes itself felt and becomes thinkable.
