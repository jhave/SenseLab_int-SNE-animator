The Body
The body is a multiphased relation that defines itself through coefficients of transversality expressive in the practice of becoming. Its project is to move life to its limit and at this limit, where the outside folds in, to express, again, differently. The body is infinitely variable, not subject but verb. And as verb it persists, infinitely.
What is infinite is the body’s appetition, not its form. “It is possible that something of the individual be eternal, and that it reincorporate itself, in some way, in the world with respect to the individual” (Simondon 1989,
102). What lives on, what is immanent to life as expressive potential, ex- ceeds this or that body. Simondon calls it “holes of individuality,” which he defines as “veritable negatives of individuals composed of a core of affec- tivity and emotivity” (1989, 102). What lives on is never the subject, never the individual. What lives on is affective resonance.
Affect is what returns. Affect returns as the force of becoming that in- cessantly creates collectivities in the making, collectivities tuning toward an outside where the mutations of difference are most forcefully creative. For affect is never exhausted: it modulates across metastable fields of ex- perience in the making, amplifying matter in its in-forming, incorporeal potential.
Affect promises nothing. It creates across and beyond good and evil. It activates. It does not conserve. It creates life, but not solely among the living. Collectivizing, it propulses individuation at the between where all projects are most volatile, where societies falter, where the actually living intersect with the already-undead of life’s immanent surface. Always more than one, affect activates the holes of individuality that animate a life.
