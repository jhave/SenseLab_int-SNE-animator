Scales of Process
The time of the event is multiscalar. “Between the physical and the vital, between the plant and the animal, we must not look for substantial differ- ences capable of creating distinctions of genre or species, but rather differ- ences in speed in the process of their formation” (Combes 1999, 42). Organ- isms that person populate the intensive strata of the dance of attention, but they do not monopolize it. Different speeds coexist in an infraspecies, infra- dimensional field. The dance of attention is a tentative holding-in-place of agitation at the limit where speciation and dimensionalizing meet. It is the holding-in-place of the rhythm of the infra where becoming is on the cusp of defining itself as this or that. “What divides being into domains is ulti- mately nothing other than the rhythm of becoming” (Combes 1999, 42).
