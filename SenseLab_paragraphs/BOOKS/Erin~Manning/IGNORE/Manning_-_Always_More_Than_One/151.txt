“As a child, everything was somewhat alive to me.” “I hear the rocks and the trees.”
“My world is organized around textures. . . . All emotions, perceptions, my whole world . . . [has] been influenced by textures.”
“There was very little difference in meaning be- tween the children next to the lake that I was play- ing with and the turtle sitting on the log. It seems that when most people think of something being alive they really mean, human.”
