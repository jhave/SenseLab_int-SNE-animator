Style * “Expressive qualities entertain variable or constant relations with one another (that is what matters of expression do); they no longer consti- tute placards that mark a territory, but motifs and counterpoints that ex- press the relation of the territory to interior impulses or exterior circum- stances, whether or not they are given. No longer signatures, but a style” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 318). Style can never be pinned down to form. It is a mode of existence always intimately tied to the event of its expres- sion, as defined in chapter 6. And yet, as with all modes of existence, there
is a certain consistency to style across occasions. A style can be recognized, in the feeling—we know-feel the languid grace of a cat, the frenzied disap- pearance of a cockroach, even before we quite see them. Style happens in this “not quite,” in the movement of expression before it takes its form as this or that. Style is always in the moving.
Style connects with the event’s affective tonality. It is movement quality carried forth into an event through the force of its reactivation from rela- tional field to relational field. It is chiefly nonsensuous, as Whitehead would say, activating for the event a certain quality of past occasions. This quality is always a renewal of itself for the present occasion. Style is therefore never quite the same for two occasions. A moving-body’s expressivity will carry the force of an attunement that can be aligned to. This aligning will express a certain style that can be connected, transversally, to other events of its kind. A movement, Forsythe-like. The how of the aligning as style is not a question of connecting to a certain superficial quality but of moving with the movement’s movement so as to captivate the movement’s very potential for expression. Moving gorilla-like.
