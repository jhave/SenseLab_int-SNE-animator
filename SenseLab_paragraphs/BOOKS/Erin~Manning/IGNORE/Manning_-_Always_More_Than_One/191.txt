interlude: Fiery, Luminous, Scary
1 The topic of the 2010 autcoM conference was “Communication, Competence, Community: Nothing About Us Without Us.”
2 I discuss this challenge at length in an earlier piece entitled “Dancing the Techno- genetic Body” in Relationscapes (2009) where I suggest that “local” interactivity is most often deadening to the processual aspect of the work because it creates a posture of cause and effect in the spectator that tends not to lead to a complex interrelation with the work’s potential above and beyond the effective constraint of the limits of the interactive set-up.
