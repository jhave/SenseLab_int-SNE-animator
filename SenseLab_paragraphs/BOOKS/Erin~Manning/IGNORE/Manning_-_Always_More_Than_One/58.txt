The scene returns three times. In hues of amber and gray-black, three ani- mated figures emerge from the sea.1 We see the first figure from behind, a standing naked male body holding a gun, walking out of the water toward an amber-gray shelled-out cityscape. Two more figures lie on their backs in the water. Then the face, a face that will haunt us with its detached famil- iarity, fills the screen, looking off slightly to the right.
A body framed by water, rippling black-amber, rises, shells brightening the amber-hued night sky (see figure 1). The image pulls back, the cityscape now framed by two feet peeking out of the water. And then we are close once more, facing the rising bodies, accompanying them as they walk out of the sea toward the city.
Two bodies, and finally a third, have now made their way out of the water. Bombs fall on the scene of destruction but we don’t hear them, the audioscape carried by the music that will haunt this scene, and with it, the film from beginning to end. In amber light we watch the bodies dress. The tone shifting from amber to gray, we accompany their climb into the city, where, still fastening their clothing, they weave into the streets, streets with posters of Bashir’s face, streets full of mute, anguished women, women whose voices we won’t hear until the very last scene. And then, as the camera turns, turning its back on the women, we are faced, again and once more, with the face, a full-screen close-up of the soldier’s impassive face.2
Twice more we will see the stark amber sky and the soldiers dressing, but never again will we see this scene from beginning to end. And yet, as we watch it, we will feel as though it repeats itself frame for frame: each
