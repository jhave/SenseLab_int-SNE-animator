Force of Form
A dance of attention has its own technicity. For each work—be it a cho- reography, a performance installation, a musical composition—a rigorous setting into place of conditions is necessary. These conditions are always specific to the event but never completely stable across its iterations. Each iteration of the event dephases the memory of its having come into exis- tence. No movement can be cued, aligned to, or performed in exactly the same way twice. Conditions are pragmatic and based, always, on the elastic now of event-time as it makes itself felt.
Think event-time as the foregrounding of the co-compositional infra- layering of diagrammatic force-form in the now of experience. For the event to dance to attention, the event must create a resonant intensity be- tween the preacceleration of the present futuring and the alignment to a future presenting. Topological time squeezed into the improbable now of movement-moving.
What emerges as a dance of attention cannot be replicated. It is not a thing, a form. Attention dances in the between of diagrams in-forming. At- tention is its own emergent choreographing. We feel attention’s dance, but it is not of us or even for us. It is with, in the milieu. It is what we connect to when we feel the procedural pull of the event’s magnetism, its overcoming of posture, form, figure, its outdoing. It is how we feel the work working. For when attention dances, the ground begins to move, and in the moving, we are moved.
