Part 1: Choreographic Ensembles
“At the beginning,” says graphics research specialist Matthew Lewis, William Forsythe’s One Flat Thing, reproduced was “all a bit, ‘what is this about?’ ” Unfazed by Lewis’s confusion, William Forsythe suggested that Lewis think of “what else” the dance could look like. This “what else” is the project of Synchronous Objects—a web-based platform for the visual- ization of the choreographic as it expresses itself through Forsythe’s staged performance One Flat Thing, reproduced (see figure 14).
A joint project with Norah Zuniga Shaw (of Ohio State University’s De- partment of Dance) and with Maria Palazzi (of the university’s Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design), Synchronous Objects creates visualizations of a series of screen-based “objects” that actively explore what else One Flat Thing, reproduced could look like. The resulting synchro- nous objects for the visualization of choreographic data reveal the patterns and complex interlocking systems of action and organization at the heart of Forsythe’s choreographic process. This opens the dance toward a “what else” of the choreographic, targeting a cross-disciplinary audience that de- parts from the strict arena of dance studies to include mathematicians, ar- chitects, cognitive scientists, and philosophers, to name a few. “Our goal
