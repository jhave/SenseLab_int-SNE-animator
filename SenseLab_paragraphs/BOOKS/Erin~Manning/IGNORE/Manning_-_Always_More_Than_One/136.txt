active in a futurity virtually impossible to articulate except through move- ment. Its position can be grasped after the fact, but to tap into its inten- sity of variation, it must ultimately be recalled in the moving. To tap into movement-moving is to recall the future in its presenting: in the moving, the future-pastness of movement’s force of form is tapped into, cueing all the while to diagrams in the making.
In a choreographic setting such as One Flat Thing, reproduced, a common assumption is that the space in the moving is premapped. Yet, were this the case, there would be little opportunity for what Suzanne Langer (1977) calls the “commanding form” of the piece, its force of form across iterations. Also called “matrix idea,” commanding form is the virtual force of a compo- sition’s inherent potential for recomposing. It is the intensive magnitude of the emergent co-expression of the composition in its serial reiteration. The “how” of the work as it is replayed across settings and environments is its commanding form. This “how” is emergent each time anew and is always a complex mixture of technique and technicity. Technique to keep the piece rigorous, to give it the subtlety and nuance and precision it requires. Tech- nicity to make the work outdo itself, to make the work work. The command- ing form of a piece is how the work dances to attention.
