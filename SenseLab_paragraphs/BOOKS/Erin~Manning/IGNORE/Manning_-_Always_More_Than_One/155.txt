on behavior, an ethics that overwrites, that judges and sequesters into so- called intelligibility the agitation of all ecologies that do not resemble it.
A transversal, ontogenetic concept of the ethical can never begin with the human or with the body as such. To situate the ethical on the macropo- litical scale of human interactivity is to underestimate the hold preconcep- tions have on our engagement with difference. It is to put too much faith in a politics of representation where the force of a life—the protopolitical bare activity of collective individuation—has been backgrounded by the systems that place the human above all else.
An ethics of relation such as the one called for by DJ Savarese must heed the call of difference in its bare agitation. An ethics of relation is an act that agitates at the level of thought-feeling, in the event: an ethics of relation has concern for the event in its emergence, refuting knower/known hierar- chies, preferring instead a horizontalizing milieu of experience where what emerges conditions the stakes of its coming-to-be.
Ethics are unsayable, and yet they can be felt in the relational matrices language calls forth, in the rhythms, tonalities, silences, velocities of lan- guage in the making. Here, the ineffable briefly comes to life, not to my life but to a life, acting with the force of life across the more-than of wor(l)ding. This more-than soars between the words. It writes-with, active in an incipi- ent choreography of expression that dances attention.
Composing-with is the bringing into act of the relation between affective tonality and affective attunement in a collectivity expressive of an across- ness of wor(l)dings that captivates, that unmoors, that tunes toward radi- cal difference. Its ethics are its unspoken call, agitating in the interstices of its commanding form, a call heard, always, in the register of the more-than that is individuation’s dance.
