Techniques for the Everyday * While movement techniques for the stage might seem to be primarily focused on the body outside of the everyday, and
techniques for participatory installations might seem to emphasize a group body (the subway, the sidewalk, the classroom), in fact both build on the as- sociated milieu of relation. There is no arabesque that does not immediately and significantly entail the enveloping of a milieu into the movement: the air, the time of day, the quality of the space, the last arabesque, all of these shape this arabesque. Every movement is a relational movement. Whether choreographing for the stage or for participatory movement events, what must be honed is therefore a distributed relational body.
One of the ways of becoming attuned to distributed relational movement is to become sensitized to the collective attunements activated by cues and alignings in everyday movement, thus learning to work with the array of decisions in that wider field of movement, human and nonhuman. This in- volves working with a modality of attention that lurks below reflective con- sciousness. For it is impossible, even in the most organized choreographic process, to map out every possible alignment. A choreographer for the pro- scenium of the theater, let alone a choreographer of participatory ecolo- gies, cannot predict how the environment will mutate. Much can be gleaned from participating in moving sidewalks. As with the cooking example, it is striking how rarely rapidly moving bodies run into one another or into open doors, garbage cans, or bus stops as they walk on busy streets. In prepara- tion for a participatory choreographic event, time on the sidewalk is key.
