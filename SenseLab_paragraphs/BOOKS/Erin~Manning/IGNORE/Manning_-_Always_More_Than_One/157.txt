Before you quite see it, Bracha Ettinger’s Autistwork n2 (1993; see figure 22) is already folding, drawing you into its vortical movement, capturing your gaze with the mesmerizing colorlessness of its center, creating an open field of turbulence for vision. You try to see the image, but it escapes you.
Feel the velocity of its folding-through vision.
What is it that Autistwork n2 does to keep frame, image, form in abeyance?
How does it paint the force of its continual unfolding?1

Begin with a photo- graph—of family, of war, of loss—and disallow the image to resolve on paper by stopping the photocopy machine halfway. Burn the copying pro- cess into the image while allowing the toner to unsettle. Create a shadow, a blur of pastness. And then activate the passing-by of the photographic image not by giving it a form—not by repainting the “completeness” of the image having passed by—but by undoing it of its ground, by painting the very impossibility of the image ever finding a secure resting place: “What is being painted is ‘the instant where the instant turns its back’: turns back on itself” (Massumi 2006, 203).

Notice that even when there is the sense of a form, an image, or a narrative, nothing comes to rest. The quality of the work is not its renouncing of the image. Nor is it simply a turn against image into the
