A Lure for Feeling
Like his choreographies, Forsythe’s choreographic objects are created with very precise conditions for movement experimentation: they insist on the precision of parameters for movement (technique) without divesting the movement of its potential for eventness (technicity). They are carefully crafted toward generating certain kinds of participation and yet unforesee- able in their effects. They are objectiles thrown into the world, and invita- tions to move-with.
Forsythe speaks of seeking physical solutions to dramaturgic proposi- tions.8 Choreographic objects are designed to provoke movement-events that can be diverted toward a recomposition of habit and, vice versa, com- positions of habit that tweak the perceived stable form of objects. This recomposition calls forth a choreography of difference, difference that emerges relationally, activated by propositions embedded into the choreo- graphic object’s potential deployment. The becoming of continuity.
Choreographic objects act not on individual will: they move the relation.
