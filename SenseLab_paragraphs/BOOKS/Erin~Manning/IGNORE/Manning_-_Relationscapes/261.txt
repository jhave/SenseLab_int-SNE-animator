The blue quivers in a quietness the red does not propose. The blue calms the one side of the animate sculpture, inviting us to view again the inverted body- legs of the becoming-bull. But we can’t distance ourselves from the red, which catches our eye in an incessant calling. We find the blue cannot be seen without the appearance of red. Red here expresses itself as an active multiplicity. This multiplicity rears its four heads, each head a play of forces of appearance and disappearance, a coming forward and moving back into the colored light of per- ception perceiving. We feel the threshold here, insistent and persuasive, between color, light, and movement.
David Spriggs’s animate sculptures are experiments with the concreteness of abstraction. Their intensity is felt through the very evanescence of their almost-form passing into multiplicity, a concreteness allied always with mu- tations that are abstract, almost-there for vision, but not quite perceivable. This paradoxical relation between the abstract and the concrete, between the virtual and the material, between the perceptible and the imperceptible, is at stake in each of Spriggs’s animate sculptures. The theory-in-movement of the work: abstraction is what makes them concrete. As concrete as a vision. Rob- ert Irwin suggests we call this movement toward the concrete “the process of a
