Explorations of new technologies and dance, led by Mark Coniglio, Scott de Lahunta, Antonio Camurri, and others, have often focused on the difficulty of locating gesture-as-such. One key to developing sensitive software is under- standing—and embedding into the software program—what a gesture is. In a 2006 paper, Scott de Lahunta suggests that the best way of coming to an un- derstanding of gesturality is to work collaboratively with dancers such that “the choreographic and computational processes are both informed by having ar- rived at this shared understanding of the constitution of movement.”38 A similar tendency is expressed by Mark Coniglio when he suggests that live performance work must “delve beyond direct mapping and the metaphor of a musical in- strument; to building systems that could better sense qualities of movement; to represent something of the ‘gestalt’ of movement.”39
An engagement with technology and dance demands an encounter with the syntax of the moving body. For the practitioners of dance and technology, the exploration of movement is intrinsically related to how to locate where a move- ment begins and ends in order to map its coordinates within a sensitive system. Yet the questions “What is a gesture?” and “How can the computer recognize one?” may not actually lead in the direction proposed by Coniglio and de La- hunta. Rather, it may direct the techno-dance process toward establishing a kind of grammar of movement that would—paradoxically—be more likely to tie the body to some preestablished understanding of how it actualizes. “Mapping”
