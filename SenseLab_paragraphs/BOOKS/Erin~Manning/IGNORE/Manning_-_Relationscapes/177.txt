the constitution of that particular form-taking. Quantitative results could ar- guably take the co-arising of intensity and form-taking into consideration in the refashioning of subsequent experimental processes: producing quantitative results need not preclude the experiential. This is the case for Marey, whose experiments create the conditions for the quantitative to be sidetracked by the qualitative. This passage from quality to quantity introduces novelty into his experiments, inciting him to create evolving forms of inquiry. A key question emerges: can there ever be “pure” positivism, or is positivism always moved by the forces of intensive magnitude?
