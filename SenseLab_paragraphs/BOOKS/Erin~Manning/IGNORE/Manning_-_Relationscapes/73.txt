bodies spin together, turning on a shared axis that emerges out of the movement itself. Grace in the making.
The language of tango—out of which this particular version of relational movement finds its consistency—identifies this centrifugal spiraling as a col- gada—a hanging spiral—the interval wider at the top while our feet stay together, our centers still facing one another. Intervals are not stable. Relational move- ment insists on morphogenesis. I may lead you into a colgada, a hanging-out, which creates a triangular interval, closed where our feet touch, opening upward and out, or, as we hang outward together in a colgada, we may reverse it into a leaning-in, a triangular form that opens downward into an intensive ground— a volcada, centripetal.
Either way, what occurs is a qualitative reshaping of a force. Taking form through the preacceleration of the movement, and sustained by the movement itself, the interval folds into an intensive expansion, or an expansive intensity, languidly “holding” the movement. This holding is not structural: it is elastic. It is almost the next movement, almost the next axis, almost the next equilibrium, but not quite yet. This elasticity of the almost is the intensive extension of the movement, a moment when anything can happen, when our bodies are poised in a togetherness beginning to take shape. The next movement has not yet come, the past movement is passing. No step has been taken, and yet in this elastic the microperception of every possible step can almost be felt.
