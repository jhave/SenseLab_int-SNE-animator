Mobile axes are the specialty of the interval that can morph and recompose at will. The stable axis of Cartesian geometry never creates movement: it pro- duces displacement. To create movement necessitates a metastable sense of balance, the extrusion of a line into a plane: energetic recomposition. To the forming-matter/mattering-form that is the embodiment of pure plastic rhythm, the interval adds the potential for energetic materiality-in-movement. The pre- accelerated state of matter projects not a displacement but a topological form- taking that in-forms the body more than it displaces it.
Think of displacement not as a movement through space but as a process of in-formation whereby space becomes what it is not-yet. Forming to deform, the body composes to recompose. To move is to exfoliate. Intensive affects are added to matter-form such that the envelope we thought we could decipher is no longer what is tangible. The effects of the virtual are felt. Relationally, we move through these effects, experiencing the texture of the interval. When the rela- tional movement flows, it is because we surrender to the interval: the interval in-forms our movement. We re-form: we create a collective body.
