resonance, imagistic in content, polyrhythmic in style, a politics that has long left behind the figure of Kant’s rational modern subject. This is not a politics already territorialized by the sovereign state. It is a micropolitics of the body through which force-lines create biogrammatic tendencies that beg the question of what politics can do. What politics can do in Riefenstahl’s work is a question of affective tone, of expressivity, much more than it is a question of content. The politics of movement Riefenstahl’s work proposes is a politics of futurity where the notion of the to-come remains unknowable. Such a politics works at the edges of a biopolitical tendency. To think this edge—the extreme topological surface where rhythm becomes body—it is necessary to think the active passage from biopolitics to the biogram.
