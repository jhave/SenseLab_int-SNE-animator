of falling, the camera becomes the protagonist of the action. The camera directs us. It provides the rhythms of the movements unfolding. This is emphasized again in a memorable sequence that follows: the four women lying down on their stomachs rise and fall, their upper torsos leading the movement. The cam- era works with the tensile activity of the dancers’ minimal gestures, moving now to one side as though filming four bodies in one, moving again as one body rolls, the breath in contra-rhythm with the bodies folding. As quickly as they fell, now the bodies pause, holding their form as the camera waits with them, suspend- ing our attention in tandem with the suspended bodies. Our watching merges with the weight of the women’s heads moving slowly in an almost-reaching of the ground’s surface. The wait is almost unbearable, the camera heavy in its quietude. And then the dancers move again, their past suspension under- scored by the camera’s focus on their backs arching, their heads still heavy but held.
What comes next is magical: the image snaps into a quickness, a wispy light- ness as the women’s weight shifts onto the tips of their fingers. This is how the image unfolds: the infinitely heavy upper bodies are held by the women’s arms through a close-up accentuating the weight on a woman’s tensed wrist. We feel the weight of the waiting physically as we watch. When the dancers suddenly lift palm to fingernails, the affective tone lifts perceptibly. We feel an intake of breath, as much our own as theirs, as we watch the bodies morph into weight- lessness. The camera is not there only for the recording; it feels-with the bodies’ shifting tonalities.
These shifting affective tonalities are landing sites. They are what Arakawa and Gins call a “depositing of sited awareness” (2002, 7). The camera focuses these sites into an in-gathering that captures them as transitory thought-feelings. We feel the shift from dances in the making to haptic experiments in the viewing.
