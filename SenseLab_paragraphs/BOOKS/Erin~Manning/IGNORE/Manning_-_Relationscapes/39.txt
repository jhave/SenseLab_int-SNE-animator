interval is not mine alone to lead. She invites me to instantiate it, feeding it with her own intensive preacceleration. Inframodally, we shape-shift this interval. As it takes form, the intensity of moving together translates into a step, this time to the front and around. She moves around me, urging my moving body-form to propel her shifting axis into a turn as I step back, repositioning my axis in direct relation to hers. The interval moves with the music, with the shifting axes, mov- ing us, creating a shared body. We move the relation.
The interval is duration expressed in movement. It is not something I create alone, or something I can re-create by myself. It exists in the between of move- ment. It accompanies my movement, yet is never passive. It activates the next incipient movement. The interval is the metastable quality through which the relation is felt. Many potential intensities populate it. It expresses itself as the shifting axis that connects us. Proposition: the interval creates the potential for movement that is expressed by at least two bodies.
