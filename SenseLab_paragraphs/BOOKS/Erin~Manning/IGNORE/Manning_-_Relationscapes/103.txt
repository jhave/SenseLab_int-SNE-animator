Walking is all about taking the next step. Walking is never one-off: the mo- mentum of the last step feeds the advance into the next one. To take the next step is to step with the feeling of walking. To step with the feeling of how we are already moving is to move-with the immanent activation of the senses spacing. This means that we walk with, as well as within, the environment perceived relationally.
To take the next step is to move-with the interval produced by preaccelera- tion, to feel-with the shape-shifting of smells encroaching, to hear-with the wall’s approach. This feeling-with is proprioceptive, immediately linked to our sense of balance, to our ability to space space. We don’t need to put our hands on the walls to feel them, or to touch the ground to know where it is. Touch crossed with vision and sound fields the environment, opening it to the rela- tional multiplicity of movement, sensation, and space-time co-mingling. Even walking alone is replete with relation: we move-with the feeling of the ground as it expands toward the pelvis, giving into the weight of gravity’s pull, participat- ing kinesthetically in the shifting dynamics of one leg grounding at a time. We move-with the edge of a room approaching or the horizon line receding. To take the next step is to move-with the world.
But what if we cannot begin to move? This is the case with the post-encephalitic patients Oliver Sacks describes in his book Awakenings. These patients are char- acterized by their incapacity to activate displacement without assistance.28 In the
