1. Dorothy Napangardi’s Mina Mina (2005) measures almost two meters in height (198 x 122 cm). Black on white, its white emergent through the black dots, Mina Mina encourages us to look-across, to move-with the fragile dotted lines that compose its labyrinths. “Looking at” is too stable for this shifting land- scape that moves, already, in many directions at once. This movement-across is not a symmetrical one that would obediently follow a horizontal or vertical perspective: it is a vibrating movement, a resonance that forces itself upon our vision. How we see becomes a politics of touch: what the painting compels is not a static viewing but an activity of reaching-toward that alters the relation between body and painting, creating a moving world that becomes a touching of the not-yet-touchable. This touching is rhythmic. It occurs not on the lines or with the points but across the vista the painting elaborates, an experiential vista that is already more than the space of the canvas can convey. The dots and lines are more than traces, they are material becomings toward a worlding immanent to the experience of viewing. The becoming-world called forth by this black and white painting is the creation of an event of which my seeing-touch is part. It takes me not somewhere else but right where I can become, to a force-field that is an eventness in the making, an exfoliation of experience.
Mina Mina envelops space, creating new space-times of experience. It liter- ally quivers with its dissonant becomings. This is not a metaphor. Space-time
