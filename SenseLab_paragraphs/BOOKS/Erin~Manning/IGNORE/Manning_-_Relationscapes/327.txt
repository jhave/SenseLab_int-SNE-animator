“While I’m doing my paintings . . . I have my country in mind” (Napangardi 2002, 11). To have something “in mind” is different from representing it. It is to work with the event of coming-to-expression more than with a precomposed image. William James’s concept of the “terminus” is useful in understanding the relationship between expression and event. For James, the terminus is “what the concept ‘had in mind’” (1912, 61). The terminus in Napangardi’s case is not the image of the Dreaming or its narrative per se but the force of its becoming through which its current iteration begins to take form. The Karntakurlangu Jukurrpa—a title she gives to a number of her works—is the terminus that gives momentum to Napangardi’s paintings. Its function is not of mimesis—her work is not a mimetic transferring of the Dreaming as stable narrative—but of pro- pensity. The Dreaming of the sticks gives the force of form to her work. Napan- gardi works with Mina Mina “in mind” to create a moving image of the intensive passage from force to form. Each painting is a composition in itself and stands out on its own as an iteration of this “in-mindness.” It is not a representation of the place or a narrative of its history. It is an encounter with its resonance.
Whitehead talks about facts this way. Rather than situating “facts” as the truth-value of an iteration, Whitehead suggests that facts are those occasions of experience that are fully composed and yet stand for more than themselves: “Every proposition proposing a fact must, in its complete analysis, propose the general character of the universe required for that fact” (1929/1978, 11).
