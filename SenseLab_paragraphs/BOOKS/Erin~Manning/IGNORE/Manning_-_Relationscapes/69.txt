face. Think walking with a lover, or dancing tango. Walking relationally means: when you walk into the hole, you walk-with. Walking-with is more than taking a step, it is creating a movement.
Creating a movement is initiating a dance. This dance demands grace, a grace that is not a succumbing to an outside, but a feeling of the inside, inside-out. “Grace is like the paradigm of intensity that escapes all quantitative reduction of movement” (Bergson 1959/1970, 12–13). Grace is never felt solely through a step. Grace is the becoming-dance of the step, when walking flows in the be- tween of directions where holes become emergent openings rather than missed opportunities.
Relational movement means moving the relation. Moving the person will never result in grace. Intensity of movement can only be felt when the in- between—the interval—created by the movement-with takes hold. This interval is ephemeral, impossible to grasp as such, yet essential to the intensive passage from a step to a graceful movement.
