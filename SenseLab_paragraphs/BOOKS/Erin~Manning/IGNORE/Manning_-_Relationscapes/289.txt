future-past is passed on from generation to generation through sand paintings, dances, and songs. The Aboriginals today are not reliving their past. They are recreating their future, making use of a topological structure in which time is embedded in shifting space, and space becomes time passing.
The itineraries of the Dreaming must be seen not as a plane that can be ad- equately captured on a two-dimensional surface, but as functioning in many dimensions at once. As Clifford Possum paints them, the Dreamings are like knots where the actual meets the virtual in a cycle of continuous regeneration. The itineraries of the Dreaming are rule-bound but not fixed: these knots of experience are always shape-shifting. Space-time is at the heart of this complex art, as are conceptual slidings, performative experience, rituals of appearance and disappearance. This space-time is not haphazard: Dreamings must be per- formed lest they disappear into disuse, their songs forgotten or unsung.97
