social, but that the collectivity that is an emergent sensing body in movement is invariably an emergent articulation of the political.
Collective must be understood here in terms of the nexus of actual occasions prehended through the eventness of the interval. Collectivity deploys itself in excess of any individual (one or many) to an idea of the infra-individuating recombination that is never one or many but always at the threshold from one to the other. To develop a thought of relation that refrains from positing the in- dividual as the starting point allows us to multiply the interval. Despite the fact that prehension restricts us to an actual occasion that is monadic in its comple- tion, it provides the potential for Guattariâ€™s notion of subjectivity: prehension produces the potential for a nexus through which the collective as singularity can be thought.
