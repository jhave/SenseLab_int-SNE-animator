Alhalkere is the very act of painting, the materiality of rhythm.
Alhalkere’s polyrhythmic quality activates timelines that are like plateaus of experience. Refuting the “purely optical,” Alhalkere makes palpable the im- manent materiality of color and shade, of movement and becoming-form. De- manding an active listening, it breathes surface and depth, noise and calm even as it carefully calls forth a minimalist gesture, a diagram of restraint that creates a sensation that is clear and precise. This precision is what allows the body—of the painting, of the viewer—to evolve with every encounter. It is what allows the painting to be both here and there, alive in its Aboriginal context in and beyond Australia. This precision, it seems to me, catches us by surprise in each of Kng- warreye’s paintings.85 It is felt like a color, but really it is a force that holds the painting to itself and while also inviting it to be much more than a painted sur- face. Alhalkere takes form through the activity of Dreaming, its diagram culmi- nating in the almost uniform yellow that invites us to weave our own stories, to dance the eventness of the layerings of experience. A map? Only if we conceive it as a layering-in, a dotting-to-infinity, where the folding-in is also a folding-out. Not a direction but a dance, a palimpsest alive with the resonances it creates.
