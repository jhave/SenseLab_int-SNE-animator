For Baggs, enabling constraints constitute finding sound machines that reso- nate within the space, creating with these sounds in tandem with the rhythm of her movements and the tonal symphony of her voice, and finding modes of expression from the limited environment in which she works that evoke the complexities inherent in the merging of the planes of composition and articula- tion. Another enabling constraint might be how to create conditions for video capture that motivate the experiential creation of space-times of experience. For Clark, an enabling constraint would be how an object or a series of objects can make felt a conjunctive body relation that functions in the realm of therapeu- tic becoming. In both cases, objects become relational in conjunction with the ways in which the environment proposes its own constitutive limits. The imma- nent value of these objects is intrinsically connected to the relations they create within these conditions. It is how these relations take form that is key—and this is where the artistic process makes itself felt. Without a set of enabling con- straints to make the work take form, Clark’s objects would melt into an already overcoded environment. Their value is how the process of invention articulates the series they co-constitute through relational movement.
Value is never an evaluation. For Nietzsche, “evaluations . . . are not values but ways of being, modes of existence of those who judge and evaluate, serving as principles for the values on the basis of which they judge” (Deleuze 1983, 1). To value is to make relational potential the subject of enquiry. Value is how a conjunctive series moves the relation.
