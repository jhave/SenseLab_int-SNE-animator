can be done. We sense to sense to sense. There is nowhere to go, nothing to do. “The conscious analysis of perception is primarily concerned with the anal- ysis of the symbolic relationship between the two perceptive modes” (White- head 1927, 81). When nothing new can be thought, negative knowings abound. Rose explains, “I think a thought and it’s suddenly gone—like having a picture whipped out of its frame. . . . I have a particular idea, but can’t keep it in mind; and then I lose the general idea, and then the general idea of general idea; and in two or three jumps my mind is blank—all my thoughts are gone, blanked out or erased” (qtd. in Sacks 1990, 76n54).
To “know negatively” is to proceed backwards from presentational imme- diacy into its infernal decomposition toward nothingness. It is to experience presentational immediacy without the relationships set up by causal efficacy, to apply the disparate onto the disparate, the qualitative onto the qualitative, ad infinitum. This infinite infolding means that there is never any “satisfaction” of the actual occasion. Never any completion to an event. What is sensed is sensed as bare sensa without altering the body-world relation, and thus without limit. All event means no event.
When you take the next step, something has happened. Movement has shifted from incipiency toward displacement. The event has taken form, leaving an opening for the next actual occasion. The next actual occasion will build on cer- tain aspects of what just happened, even while it recomposes into new configu- rations. The causality of perception does not mean that the next actual occasion will be the same. It means that the event of taking the last step makes ingress into the experience of taking the next step. It means your walk moves through movement moving: symbolic reference. To take the next step, you need to feel the experience of relation recomposing beyond the inertia of being. Taking the next step gathers force for becoming.
