cosmic . . .), and out of which complex refrains constitute highly relative exis- tential synchronies” (Guattari 1995, 16). Incorporeal becomings are made up of rhythmic intervals, rhythms that are detected as they are produced only to find themselves always already there.
Time is not endured. It is activated. To dance is not to make steps. “This dance can only be made from the inside.”20 The interval is prehended not in the displacement as such but in the event of being-connected: the interval is a connection machine. The interval reminds us that the body-world (in recom- bination) is a technology.21 It is a technology insofar as it is capable of accessing the connection machine, of creating the movements of thought that extend the interval across space-time. It is a technology insofar as it is a “Body without Organs” (BwO)—a body always qualitatively more-than the organization of its biological composition (Deleuze and Guattari 1987). The interval is a technol- ogy of the body-becoming: organic insofar as it qualitatively alters the molecular and molar composites that make up our experience of space-time, prosthetic in the sense that the body is populated by senses that extend the regions of the body beyond its organic envelope to “technologically” connect it to its process of worlding. In this process of worlding, what exactly is prosthetic and what is biological is contestable: processes of relay are always at once machinic and bio- logical, organic, and technological.22 Ontogenetic bodies as pure plastic rhythm are always recomposing, proposing relations between series. Movement is a technology of the becoming-body.
