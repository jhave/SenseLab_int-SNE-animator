The camera pans through a multitude of windows. It is raining. The rain lends an opacity to the surface of the windows as though coming from within. We perceive a space within a space within a space. We watch as a woman circles, sounding a movement that seems to precede her, the camera catching her from the front, from above, leaving her behind the windows, passing toward another room. Rain, a movement inside, above, dark, shades of blue-black. Rosas danst Rosas, the film that was shot thirteen years after the first performance of its danced choreography, is more than a film of a dance. It is a seeing-with of dance participating with the moving screen. It is the filming of sites landing, sites that are less place-formations than affective tonalities in the passage from movement to its taking form.
This first long scene that begins with the rain, with the camera moving through a space that seems to be an endless labyrinth of windows, is a scene heavy with the languor of a relation forming between bodies, ground, and par- titioned space. The presence of the camera is felt as though it were another body forcefully moving us to watch, constraining us to see not only a location or a dance but the tensile rhythm of groundedness itself. The camera works with this ground, pulling the dance into its weighted lethargy, into a vibratile exhaus- tion that is not a mimesis of grounded bodies but emphasizes the groundâ€™s very resonance as a dancing medium.
The ground is a landing site for the camera in Rosas danst Rosas. It is not a land-ing site in the sense that landing implies a grounding. It is a landing site
