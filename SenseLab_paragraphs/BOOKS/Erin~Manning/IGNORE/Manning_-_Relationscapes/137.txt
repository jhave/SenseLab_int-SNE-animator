Let me return to my example of walking to the bus stop. Earlier, I suggested that the ground’s recomposition of the dancing body was simply an extreme example of the everyday walking body’s relation to ground. You might say: whereas the dancing body specifically dances the ground, walking to the bus stop is an activ- ity that presupposes a stable ground. Is it so cut and dry?
While walking to the bus stop, the ground reconfigures the series into a focus toward a transportational vector. In advance of the walking, the bus stop already appears as the propulsion for the walk: the ground-in-itself is backgrounded in favour of transportational (bus-oriented) momentum. The prehension ground-movement in this case is directly intertwined with transportability. Yet the ground also contributes to walking, despite the fact that the transduction of
