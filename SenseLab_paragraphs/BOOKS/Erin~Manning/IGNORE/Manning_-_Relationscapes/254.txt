its place is a wholeness of movement that finds expression in the multiple body- becoming repeating differently each time. A becoming-bird appears that is unforgettable, uncanny, untimely. What moves are superimposed durations of body-becomings, biograms, rhythmically ascending and descending.
To work through an episteme that operates at the threshold where biopolitics becomes biogram is not to suggest a complete annihilation of the biopolitical. If the biopolitical is concerned with populations, the biogram is the virtual node that creates conjunctions of the body-becoming of these divergent populations. But where affective tendencies can still be relayed back to individual tendencies within a biopolitical paradigm, biograms do not individualize. Like the sea of flags moving, biograms call forth thresholds that qualitatively alter the recom- binations they foreground. Biograms affectively recompose series at the virtual node that is their hinge. Biogrammatic politics are affective politics, operating at the cusp of divergent series, creating not a body as such but an affective tone of a becoming-body, a plastic rhythm, a transcendent materiality, a topological surface, a physically transcendent asignifying materiality. Riefenstahlâ€™s images are the precursors of such contemporary biogrammatic bodies that express be- fore they symbolize. When the image operates on the becoming-body biogram- matically, the effect is dizzying: direct time on wholeness of movement. What appears: intensity, tonality, affect. Leni Riefenstahl works an architectonic of rhythm not onto the body as such but onto its appearance. And when bodies appear, politics begin to move.
