The shot of these men is first taken from above and behind and then slowly pans toward stone columns where a delegation awaits. As it reaches the columns, the camera alters its trajectory and begins to move across the shot to film intermit- tently from behind stone. This shift in the camerawork alters the composition of the shot. What we want to perceive is momentarily eclipsed by the stone col- umns. The image of the three men’s approach is one of appearance/disappear- ance that brings their grandeur into focus while catching in its intensity the stone-coldness of the perched eagle amid the immense swastika-clad flags that compose the militarized space.
In this play of appearance/disappearance, the rhythm of the image is inter- laced with the marching cadence of the orchestral music. We prehend the scene in quick bursts, our perception of the juxtapositions of various verticalities poly- rhythmic. The cadence does not take over: the measure is more than one. The provocation is affective. The audio is not outside: we feel its movement as part of the image’s force. Polyrhythms of appearance-disappearance shift the affec- tive tone of this experience of almost-seeing. Riefenstahl intensifies this affective tone as the scene progresses by alternating rhythmically from Hitler’s body to the military bodies and the crowd. The one-many is achieved through quick succession: the crowd grows in consistency while Hitler’s body defines itself as the locus of singularity.
The military measure of the disciplined marching is predominant and over- powering without being the only rhythm at play. There is a fissure here be- tween what we hear and what we see, a strange cadence in step with a rhythmic
