She moves alone at first. Then, her alone is met with the trace of her movements evaporating. Movement emanates from the poses of her movement stilling, traces of her becoming-movement left behind. And then she leaves the pose of her stilled body to move somewhere else. At different time intervals, the posing body follows her continuing movement, creating a refrain of past movement in future becoming. Soon these traces of the surplus of movement passing begin to take over the apparent stillness, folding through the animation’s dance, landing not into the next pose, but into the surfacing of its disappearance.
The solo dancer in Pas de deux dances her own form-taking, her displace- ments soon no longer discernable as such. Foregrounding the virtual event of movement moving as animate form, McLaren makes the process of force’s con- tribution to form felt. Incipiency is perceived not in the execution of a movement per se, but in the elastic force of movement’s decomposition, allowing “form to occupy a multiplicity of possible positions continuously within the same form” (Lynn 1999, 10).
For Lynn, the most important factor of animate design is the “co-presence of motion and force at the moment of formal conception” (1999, 11). Animate form is not about adding force to the already-thought or to the already-executed. It involves working with the force of potential that is co-constitutive of anima- tion’s dance. This is how McLaren works in Pas de deux. Rather than offering a filmed version of the ballet dancers’ performance of the pas de deux, he opens the force of movement moving to perception.
Pas de deux animates movement’s virtual preacceleration as it takes form. The pas de deux itself—a dance choreographed for two in which the male dancer
