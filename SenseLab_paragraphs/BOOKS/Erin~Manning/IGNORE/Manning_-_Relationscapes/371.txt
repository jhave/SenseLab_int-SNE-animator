call this inner rhythm a “block of sensation.” “We paint, sculpt, compose, and write with sensations” (1994, 166). Blocks of sensation are forces that compose thought’s durational attitude. To edit from within is to compose with the more- than of language’s actual articulation. It is to work with language’s prearticulated virtual force, directing enunciation such that its virtual effects are felt within actual expression.
Editing from within seeks to create space-time, not simply reproduce it. “Rhythm is determined not by the length of the edited pieces, but by the pres- sure of the time that runs through them” (Tarkovsky 1987, 117). Editing from within is rhythmic editing that foregrounds the time-pressure inherent in expe- rience. Time-pressure is a block of sensation. It is the force of a transformation that brings prearticulation’s virtual potential to life.
