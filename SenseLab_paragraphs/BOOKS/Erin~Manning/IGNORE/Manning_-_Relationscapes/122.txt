very more-thanness of pure plastic rhythm must come to the fore. We must move beyond the prosthetic as an external category toward an exploration of the originary technicity that technogenesis taps into.
Technogenesis—ontogenesis of the bio-technological not as a technical ad- ditive to the biological but as an emphasis on originary technicity—suggests a working vocabulary. Here, the body is posited not as a stable category but as a creative vector of experiential space-time. Foregrounded is the body in move- ment: pure plastic rhythm. Such a body cannot be dissociated from the flux of micromovements of which it is composed. To think a body in movement is not to locate the body in a preformed world but to conceptualize moving worlds as instances of interrelating bodies. Technogenesis defines bodies as nodes of potential that qualitatively alter the interrelations of the rhizomatic networks of space-time in which they are ephemerally housed. These networks are not distinct from the bodies they instantiate: they are themselves sensing bodies in movement. Sensing bodies in movement are open systems that reach-toward one another sensingly, becoming through these relational matrices. As these bodies individuate relationally, they evolve beyond their ontological status, be- coming ontogenetic. Technogenesis is the dynamic becoming of the sensing body in movement.
