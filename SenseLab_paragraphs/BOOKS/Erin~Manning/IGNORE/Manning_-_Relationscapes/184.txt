Marey wanted to learn how to fly. In 1869, he developed his first graphic ma- chine to explore the flight of birds. His main concern was to understand the mechanisms of the wing of the bird in space and the intermittent effects of air on the moving wings. Already in these early graphic experiments, he was atten- tive to how the combinatory milieu of air-flight-movement reveals operations of force. His research question was to what extent the quality of being airborne depends on the muscular apparatus, and whether the air itself works as a force of resistance to produce an intensive movement that keeps the bird in flight. This question was directly associated to creating a flying machine, an interest that led to many years of experimentation with how flight itself creates the conditions for the bird’s movement, and how air resistance rather than simple musculature keeps the bird aloft.
The first machines were quite simple: Marey placed a small sensing apparatus on the edge of each wing that measured the bird’s flight. This apparatus’s func- tion was to graphically measure each received movement. With a thin cable
