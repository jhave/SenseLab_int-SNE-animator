“The world is the infinite curve that touches in an infinity of points an infin- ity of curves, a curve with a single variable, the convergent series of all series” (Deleuze 1988a, 34). The elastic point is eventful. It makes felt the lingering of actuality as it begins to fold back into the virtual, preaccelerating into the next becoming-movement. This lingering is part of the walk, part of its constraint— back, front, side. The infinite potential in three directions makes itself felt in the elasticity of the almost, but is as present in all of movement’s stages. To improvise is to be able to pull incipient movement out of the directions, to create the elastic out of the line (that itself becomes elastic), to redirect force, and move with it. To create an event.
For an event to occur, experience has to be pulled out of the indeterminate, activated from the virtuality of the not-yet. This provocation is the event of the occasion’s taking form. As we move together, an opening to the side may announce itself. This prehension is not simply a cue, it is a detail of activity that produces a tendency for a relational encounter. This relational encounter precedes cognitive understanding. Prearticulation fuels preacceleration, incit- ing a reaching-toward, not into a space predetermined, but toward a curving of space-time. Curving space-time moves the relation, activating a becoming- body. Movement’s intensive unfolding creates an embodiment of pure plastic rhythm. The fulfillment of the occasion is not the step but the recombination of forces out of which future movements will take form.
