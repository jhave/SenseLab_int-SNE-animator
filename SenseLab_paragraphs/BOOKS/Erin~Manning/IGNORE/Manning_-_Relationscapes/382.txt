An appetite for experimentation must always be connected to concrescence. A completely open system gives nothing but more openness (closure). Feeling is power’s “compulsion of composition” (Whitehead 1929/1978, 119). This com- pulsion to compose is an aesthetic drive, a will toward sensation, a will to power. The will to power is not about individual power. The will to power activates the potential of a force to move a body to its limit. Power is a lure for feeling. Before Nietzsche called it the Will to Power, he called it the “feeling of power” (1968).
The will to power in Amanda Baggs’s video is the injunction to make the world felt through the force of prearticulation. In My Language seeks to articu- late at the limit of expression. Its will to power demands that we create concepts out of the matter-form of our environments, that we activate the virtual force of our becoming-worlds and conceive of this activation as a becoming-language, that we feel the affective quality of expression’s incipient appetition. Amanda Baggs asks of the process of worlding that it include language’s prearticulation, that it foreground the activity of creating concepts, that it will these concepts out of matter-form itself, that it mould the activity of process into a becoming-body of invention. She demands of expression that it value its own becoming, that it open thought and sensation beyond the actuality of what the world appears to be through words.
The will to power makes force felt. Felt force is a concept-in-waiting. There is no subject to the will to power, no outside criteria that forces. Force propulses
