Articulated concepts retain their force only when the indeterminacy of their virtual potential as feeling-thoughts is maintained and renewed.
In My Language exposes the process involved in the creation of concepts. These concepts evolve out of conjunctions between expressive nodes. The con- cept of sound, for instance, is felt as gesture in movement: sound stands in for the feltness of movement emergent through relational objects. We feel sound rhythmically. We find ourselves thinking sound. Sound becomes a concept for language in the making.
Not all thought transduces into a concept. Concepts are forces that take form at the junction between the emergence and expressibility of thought. Concepts move-with the force that is the virtual plurality of each incipient event. In con- ceptual articulation, forces work imperceptibly, and yet their virtual preartic- ulation can be felt. Concepts emerge in tandem with the forces’ struggle for valuation within the work. The concept is an elastic point in the passage from the virtual—thought—to the actual—articulation. Concepts inflect thought to- ward expression. Concepts are the points of inflection that move thought toward language.
Concepts act as differentials for prearticulation. The differential produced by a concept cuts into the plane of experience, foregrounding its enunciatory potential. As a vector of transformation, the differential forces thought into the nowness of its actualization. The production of the now is the necessity—what Nietzsche calls the destiny—of language in the making. This necessity is what brings thought—via the concept—into appearance.
