Prehensions are events of perception. They pull what become actual occa- sions from the extensive continuum of experience. The extensive continuum is made up of the undifferentiated folds of the universe. The outfolding through prehensions of the infolding of experience propels the taking-form of an event. With its unfolding into an event comes the expression of life in the making.
Life is as complex as the actual events that compose it. These actual events are multiple, each of them composed of prehensions culled from the magnitude of pastness non-sensuously felt as the present passing. Non-sensuous percep- tion is the activity of perceiving the tonality of pastness in the present. Non- sensuous perceptions shade the currency of futurity. Perception as the infolding of the potential for activation of the future-past is the relational nexus for life- in-the-making. Perception is not the taking-in of an object or a scene. It is the folding-with that catches the event in the making.
Every actual occasion has a physical and a mental pole. The physical pole is the datum for the event’s actualization. The mental pole is the potential for abstraction. Actual occasions become conceptual through the ingression of eternal objects. Eternal objects are what give actual occasions their quality. The quality of a prehension will differ in accordance with the kind of eternal objects associated with it. An eternal object is the event’s tonality—the whiteness, the hardness, the liveliness. This tonality provides a quality of relation for the event across the nexus of actual occasions.
