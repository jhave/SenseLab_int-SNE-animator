through, qualitatively altering the milieus it creates that, in turn, generate it. “Transcoding or transduction is the manner in which one milieu serves as the basis for another, or conversely is established atop another milieu, dissipates in it or is constituted in it” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 313). The early image of the man-rod walking imposes measure onto movement. The movement is territorialized into coordinates that tend to close down its operations. The con- straints of the walk—one foot on the ground at all times—become coded in a regularized space-time, which closes down all potential for the walk to evolve beyond its initial normative constraint. The resulting perception of the image is a perception of movement rather than a perception in movement. In the later image of the walking undulation, the walking transduces into curvilinearity, producing an associated milieu of body-movement-environment. Here percep- tion participates in the quasi chaos of preacceleration. The associated milieu of preacceleration vibrates with the potential of polyrhythmicality. The walk as such is not transformed, it is what is emphasized that is different. This time the walk is more than a regularization of coordinates. It is a line of force, an elastic pulling and pushing through movement’s intensive magnitudes. What is felt
