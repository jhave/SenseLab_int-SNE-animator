centrifugally recombined with movement moving. The interval becomes inten- sively relayed with the force of the spiral, creating a turbulence that moves the relation. This can be a quiet, even serene turbulence, a graceful intensity, or it can be a wild, excessive turbulence. Either way, it envelops the contours of the steps, creating a spur, a trace of the line of flight that characterizes the displace- ment of the moving relation.
The elasticity of the almost shifts the associated milieu of the interval toward a field of curvature. The movement curves and the two bodies moving feel the approach as a joining of the forces of movement. The effect opens the dance to an actualization that is not a displacement per se but a virtual intensity becom- ing actual. We become spiral. Intensive connection. To remain in the elasticity for as long as possible is the goalâ€”but remaining on the edge of virtuality is a challenging task. Sometimes we linger.
