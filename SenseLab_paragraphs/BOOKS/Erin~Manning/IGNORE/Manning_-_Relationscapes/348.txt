Karlangu (Digging Sticks) (2001). In this black and white vertical painting, 244 x 168 cm, the black background is felt more keenly than in much of Napan- gardi’s work,120 inciting the white to stand out in a continual interplay of back- ground/foreground. In the inner realm of the painting, the black opens up in oblong forms that feel like digging sticks. They take the form of digging sticks. But it is not simply their shape that gives them the resonance of the digging sticks; it is the force conveyed through the blackness pushing forward through the white. The background takes the form of the painting’s title, and yet it reso- nates more than it represents. The contrast here is not between black and white. It is felt through the interplay of forces that evoke vibratory patterns that in turn create the movement—the force taking form—of the work. This contrast cre- ates a rhythm that dances the taking-form of the Dreaming. We feel the digging sticks before we see them.
