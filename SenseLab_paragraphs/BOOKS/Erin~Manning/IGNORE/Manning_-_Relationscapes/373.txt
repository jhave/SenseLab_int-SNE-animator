Thought in motion intensifies patterns of force, some edited in as concepts in the making, some left by the wayside for future thinkings. Francis Bacon refers to patterns of force as diagrams. Diagrams cannot be defined as such; they are felt only in their effects. They virtually resonate, recomposing sensation, col- lecting the intensity of rhythm and propelling it toward a becoming-work of the work. Bacon speaks of diagrams as “orders of sensation,” “levels of feeling,” each of them conceived as different orders of a singular block of sensation.
The diagram of In My Language is felt as the intensity of relation activated through the conjunctive series object-sound-gesture. This series territorializes the musical environment Baggs co-constitutes. Think the diagram as territory beyond representation. Representation solidifies the imaginary of preexistent worlds and asks thought to fit within their borders. Diagrams resist borders, activating tendencies of becoming-form and incipient conjunction. Think the diagram as a landing site you cannot quite define, a site that fields you more than you see it, a focal point through which the work organizes itself in a refrain of infinite unfolding. Diagrams create intensive networks that make thought resonate.
Diagrams are prearticulations of thought in motion. They foreground the work’s elastic points, its tendencies. Like biograms, which express the virtual node through which a body becomes, they are nodal points around which the future of thought’s exfoliation circulates. They make the elasticity of the al- most felt, exfoliating the work’s potential across its shifting surface. Diagrams
