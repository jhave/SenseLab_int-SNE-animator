A contemporary of Boccioni and Bergson, and a great influence on Leni Riefen- stahl, Émile-Jacques Dalcroze developed a taxonomy of rhythm out of which he created Eurhythmics, a pedagogic tool for movement central to the work of many modern dancers, including Mary Wigman, one of Riefenstahl’s early teachers.
Dalcroze began his research with an interesting question: how is rhythm felt? In the course of his exploration into the varieties of modes of hearing and feeling rhythm, Dalcroze discovered that rhythm is not solely of the ear. It is amodal, and even more than that, it is virtually physical. This discovery led him to ques- tion how rhythm was taught. Too often, he observed, rhythm is conceived as an external meter for an internal process. Yet rhythm, he writes, “call[s] for the muscular and nervous response of the whole organism” (Dalcroze 1921, vi). Developing an early vocabulary for kinaesthesia and proprioception, Dalcroze noted that “sufficient attention is not paid to the determination and analysis of the relations undoubtedly existing between sound and dynamics, between pitch and accentuation, between the varying tempi of musical rhythms and the choice of harmonies” (1921, 6).
For Dalcroze, rhythm is not cadence or measure. It is not external to expe- rience. To extrapolate from Dalcroze, this means that rhythm moves through elastic points on durational planes. These planes are milieus of transmutation. They are not locations as such: they always exceed what Whitehead calls simple location. This means that they have no discrete spatio-temporal coordinates and
