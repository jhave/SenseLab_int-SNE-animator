Taking form always begins with the terminus. The terminus is not an end point but the energy of a beginning. The terminus kick-starts the process of articulation. There is no causal finitude here: we never know what becomes of a beginning. The directionality we have “in mind” is a relation of tension, a reaching-toward that makes us think, always more than a goal. The terminus is a force of thought toward articulation.
We often assume language’s termini are words. Words are not language’s termini; they are only one of the events along the way. The terminus of lan- guage is the relational folding-through of prearticulation. Language emerges not through an already-constituted thought: it merges with thought’s tendency
