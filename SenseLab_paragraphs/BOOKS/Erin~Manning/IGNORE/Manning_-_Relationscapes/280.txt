all Dreamings, but as many versions and contexts as are necessary for the story to be composed again.
Associated with the Dreaming is a certain birthright. In Aboriginal Central Desert society, you are born where the Dream enters you. To be born in Warlpiri is “palkajarri”—“becoming body.”91 A virtuality actualizes itself in the birth, a virtuality that is crystallized through a verse of a song that will be sung for gen- erations to come. This song will “belong” to the becoming-body in the form of a Dreaming for which he or she will remain Kirda. To become-body is to mate- rialize as song, as Dream, as rhythm.92 It is not to materialize individually but to be sung again, to become as a multiple body of communal experience. “Warlpiri philosophy does not oppose images to the substance or the essence of things. The two are indissociable” (Glowczewski 1989, 212).
The cosmology of the Dreaming must be understood as both actual and vir- tual.93 It is an overlapping of the two, where reality and dream are not opposed but superimposed. Aborigines of the Central Desert animate time in space. In their rituals, the present is ancestralized not as a nostalgia for the past but as a becoming-future. The past and the future, the actual and the virtual are traces of becoming whose dimensions are experienced in shifting continuity, as through the spiral of a Nietzschean eternal recurrence. When time is activated in this way what emerges is a timeline that is not linear. The present is always in the mode of an embodying withness not of a forgotten past but of a reexperiencing in the future-present.
