2. The Sense Lab (www.senselab.ca) was conceived in 2004 and is directed by Erin Man- ning. It is a research-creation environment for thought in motion. The Sense Lab is now housed at the Société des Arts Technologiques (SAT) as part of the SAT-Université de Montréal research-creation project entitled Art&D.
3. The Workshop in Radical Empiricism was conceived in 2004 and is directed by Brian Massumi. In 2005, it joined the Sense Lab. All Sense Lab activities are coorganized by Erin Manning and Brian Massumi with the assistance of Sense Lab members.

5. In this prelude, I have foregrounded the collaborative spirit behind Technologies of Lived Abstraction by embedding in it portions of the calls for participation, which were collectively written. For the complete texts, see the “events” rubric at www.senselab.ca.
