The different planes that compose a given movement are like modes. The move- ment composes itself through each of these modes in its own singular way. When a mode fulfills its process, another mode takes over. In relational movement, modes would include preacceleration, intervals, spirals. The planes of movement are felt in the shifting of preacceleration toward the creation of an interval (mov- ing the relation) through the propelling of a spiral, curving into the elastic point toward the becoming-form of the almost, leading back into preacceleration. Al- though there is a certain linearity in these modes, it would be a mistake to think
