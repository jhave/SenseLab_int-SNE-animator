“It is more difficult to stand than to move” (Feldenkrais 1981, 44). Standing still is a metastable activity: the stillness demands precise adaptation to the micro- movements of a shifting equilibrium. To stand still you have to move.
Everyone sways. You may think you’re standing still, but actually you’re drift- ing, shifting slightly to the left, your ankle twitching as your weight moves to the ball of your foot, your knee bending slightly as you take in a breath. As Bruce Schechter noted after trying to measure the stillness of people standing: “It doesn’t matter whether you are feeble or fit, the fact is you have never stood stock still in your life” (2001, n.p.). Standing still requires constant correction. These are not conscious corrections. They are virtual micromovements that move through the feeling of standing still. When these micromovements are felt as such, they take over the event of standing, and you experience co-contraction: you lose your balance.
Stillness is always on its way to movement. When you stand still, you don’t feel the “how” of movement stilling unless you’re asked to feel the stillness. Then you find you can’t stop thinking about how you’re moving. You feel your wob- bly ankle, your thoughts moving, your nose itching, your back aching. All you really want to do is move through the movement. Not that surprising, then, that when J. J. Collins and C. J. de Luca asked participants to stand still, they found that the foot’s center of pressure “wriggl[ed] around like a demented eel” (qtd. in Schechter 2001, n.p.).
