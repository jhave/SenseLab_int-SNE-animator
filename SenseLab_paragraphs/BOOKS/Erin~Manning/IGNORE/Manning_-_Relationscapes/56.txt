The interval is virtual, incorporeal. Yet it has substance: it is palpable. For Spi- noza, substance is not prior to its attributes, nor does cause precede effects. As Deleuze writes, “Substance is ‘its’ infinite diversity itself; it is realized in this diversity and is nothing other than the process of production without begin- ning or end (beyond teleology, without goals or direction) of itself through the infinity of its attributes” (1997, xvii). The substance of the interval is its capacity to retain qualities even after its perishing within an actual occasion. This qual- ity of movement is not: it acts. As pure duration, the interval creates a schism in linear time, preserving the future in the present. The time-slip of the interval is the future anterior: the will-not-yet-have-happened. The interval never marks a passage: it creates the potential for a passage that will have come to be. This duration is defined less by succession than by coexistence, virtually.
