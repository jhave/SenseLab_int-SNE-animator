The art of movements that are drawn is animation’s dance of the between. When animation dances, it foregrounds incipient movement rather than actual dis- placement. Norman McLaren works with movement’s incipience, creating tech- niques to animate this virtual quality of the in-between. His techniques are many, including those he invented: the pastel method, which he first used while creat- ing Là-haut sur ces montagnes (1945), and the stereoscopic three-dimensional technique used in Around is Around (1951). Each of the techniques for anima- tion McLaren invented or used involves making the virtual interval of move- ment’s preacceleration felt.
Like Étienne-Jules Marey before him, McLaren’s experimentation with the incipiency of movement involves creating new techniques to catch move- ment in its passing. His interest in technique is an exploration with the tech- nicity of the “how” of movement moving: “How it moves is as important as what moves” (McLaren 2006). The how of movement moving is movement’s
