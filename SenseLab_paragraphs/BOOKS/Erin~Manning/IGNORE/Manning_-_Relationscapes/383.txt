a will toward the creation of a dynamic form, opening feeling to its activation, generating expression in its passing.
To feel power is to feel force, to be captivated by force and to capture that captivation. Will to power fields inner dynamism and moves it into actualiza- tion through a concrescence that activates new parameters for thought. It is only after the fact that the active necessity of the feeling’s plane of composition—the superject125—takes form. This taking form is less the formation of a concrete identity than the culmination and residue of a process. To posit a subject for feeling means engaging with the creative from outside. This is an evaluative strategy, a reactive interruption of the process. Reactivity dulls force, stalling its potential for transformation.
