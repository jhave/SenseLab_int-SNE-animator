that results can easily be plotted onto a graph, but movement’s preacceleration cannot be felt.
But Marey does not stop there. He continues to experiment with the walk, producing a completely different image eight years later. This one, called “Tra- jectory of the Pubis during Human Walking (1894)” is an undulating line, curv- ing in an elastic zigzag from right to left. This time what we see is not a grid but a rhythm. For this later experiment in locomotion, rather than using a vertical rod to measure movement, Marey places bright points on the body’s hips, thus capturing the spiral of movement moving. Without the rods holding the body to a straight line, the curve of movement’s spiral makes itself felt. The line does not simply represent movement: it creates the feeling of movement. We are moved by what we do not actually see. The elasticity of the image feels like a drawing of vision drawing.
Felt movement is more difficult to plot on straight lines. Measure, or cadence— as opposed to rhythm—produces graphically equidistant formations along which a line can be plotted. Rhythm, on the other hand, is produced through inflection—the infinite folding of a line provoked by vectors of force that alter its trajectory in time and space—and operates in the register of elasticity.
