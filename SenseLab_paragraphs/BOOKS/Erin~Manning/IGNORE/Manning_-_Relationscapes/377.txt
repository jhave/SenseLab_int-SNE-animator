Amanda Baggs feels the world. Watch her reading a book: she touches it, puts her face into it, listens to the pages rustling, smells it, looks at it. Becoming-bodies feel-with the world. Feeling-with is not without thought. It is a force for thought. Donâ€™t mistake feeling with emotion. Emotion is the rendering of an affect, feeling is its force. Affective tone is an environmental resonance of a feeling-in-action, a vibratile force that makes a resonant milieu felt. By feeling the book, Baggs brings the book into relation with a force of prearticulation that exceeds the book-as-object. The book becomes conjunctive, valued within a complex re- sponsive environment. Culling the bookness from the book, Baggs makes the field of its musicality felt, its texture, its force of becoming not only as an object to be read but as a relation to be lived.
