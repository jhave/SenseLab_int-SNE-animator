When articulation becomes collective, a politics is made palpable whereby what is produced is the potential for divergent series of movements. This is a virtual politics, a politics of the not-yet. In-forming analogously to the interval, these politics of touch are substantial but ungraspable. These are not politics we can choreograph but politics in the making. These are politics not of the body, but of the many becoming one, increased by one. The body-in-deformation is a multiplying sensing body in movement: many potential bodies exist in a sin- gular body. These are politics of that many-bodied state of transition that is the collective.
When thinking a politics of movement, it is important to remember that repetition involves the intangible moment of transition between the virtual and the actual where preacceleration is in-formed by its potential becoming. This duration is always on the cusp of taking form: there is no “afterwards.” When movement has ensued in displacement, acceleration is re-intensified into preacceleration, and the interval is active once more, ready to in-form the next infra-individuation. In this regard, there is always simultaneity of movement, always an overlapping of actual, actualizing, virtual, and virtual- izing movements. Divergent series—nexuses of actual occasions—converge.
