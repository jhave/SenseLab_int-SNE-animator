To paint the landscape with acrylics is a relatively new form of art for the Ab- origines of Australia. Until the early 1970s, stories of land and spirit were evoked mostly through other media—sand, bark, wood. Today, acrylics produced in the desert are a voice of transition, marking the uncanniness of the future-past of the land, its mappings, its dreams.
Dreamings—Jukurrpa87—are an integral aspect of life in Central Desert so- ciety.88 Stories told for more than 40,000 years, Dreamings not only speak about the landscape and its vicissitudes, they create space-times of experience. This creative alchemy sustains more than a reciprocal relationship to the land: it is also an enactment of the Law. Law creates-with life, setting operational con- straints for the perpetuation of the creative nexus between Dreaming and life. As story, Dreaming evokes the lived landscape, a spiritual and lived experience.
