Michel Foucault defines biopolitics not as that which replaces the disciplinary but as a series that works conjunctively with the notion of the disciplined in- dividual while it moves beyond it toward a body-becoming. In the biopolitical episteme, movements of bodies work not at the level of individual detail but with global mechanisms of equilibrium, of regularity, of normativity. To interject into the normativity of the body-politic does not imply an intervention within a par- ticular body but an intervention within the micropolitics of movement itself. Riefenstahl’s work emerges from this biopolitical tendency, yet already moves beyond it through the biogram. Riefenstahl’s becoming-bodies preempt the next episteme, one that concerns neither what a single or a group body can do but how a focus on movement moving can create a critique of pure feeling.
The techniques of movement at work in Leni Riefenstahl’s conception of the movement-image move from the biopolitical toward the biogram in the sense that they emerge in the interstices of a body-becoming from the ques- tion of what a body can do. They operate through forces that create. For Riefenstahl, it is not a question of the power of a particular body. The body emerges not fully formed but in relation to an associated milieu that is itself a body-becoming.
Riefenstahl’s politics are affective because of their insistence on making con- junctions at the level of the incipiency of the preformed. What is expressed through her work are the rhythmic pulsations of dynamic form: her images work liminally from the edges of concepts and forms, folding them beyond their limits. Riefenstahl’s aesthetic is a politics both dangerous and inventive,
