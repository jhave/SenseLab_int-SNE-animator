folding. Unfolding is intensive movement. Perception is the activity of making this intensity felt in the taking-form of worlding.
Folding into perception is moving-with the virtual resonance of force taking form. Perception is in the folds, not of the folds. It has no object as such. Folding into perception is sensing-with the world worlding. Perceiving pulls out singu- larity: this is what we identify in its passing as an object. What we perceive is the object’s capacity to create contrasts, to differentiate the nexus: “It is that the perceived resembles something it forces us to think” (Deleuze 1993, 95; transla- tion modified). The quality of perceptibility—the whiteness, for instance—calls forth a feeling for white. I think cappuccino foam. This perception creates a feeling for coffee.
Perception infolds thoughts in the making. It does not reflect the world, it in- gathers its relational fact into a feeling for its future infolding. An object becomes the threshold for thinking feeling. The event is not “seeing an object” but fold- ing the “objectile” that contributes to perception’s infolding. We perceive-with objects, catching the edges of their contours, participating in the relations they call forth. Eternal objects make ingress into this object-world individuation, creating the potential for future relation. The objectness of the object is how it is felt relationally, rather than simply its actual matter-form. How it takes form on the nexus is how we prehend it. This quality of relation is what gives an object-event its potential infinitude. Perception is the force for the world’s infi- nite unfolding.
