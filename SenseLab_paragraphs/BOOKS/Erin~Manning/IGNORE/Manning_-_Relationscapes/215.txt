We experience not the discus thrower, or the javelin thrower, but the very thrownness of experience in the making.
The next series begins with a shift in the music from an orchestral ebul- lience to a more tentative, lighter score. The thrownness of the last series now merges with the sky, a structural point for the next series. This structural point actualizes the intensive shift from thrownness to swaying. On the intensive background of atmospheric potential, the mood changes. The quality of the movement shifts from a line of flight to a textural surface. The flute is pre- dominant now, playfully interacting with the women’s bodies as they merge into one another, shots overlapping. Another multiple body begins to take form, an amalgamation of limbs becoming grass, becoming clouds, becom- ing atmosphere. The arms dissolve into sky, fading into the legs of a woman skipping, the movement appearing always as though in advance of the dis- placement it provokes. As with the throwing in the last series, preacceleration makes tangible the way in which total movement creates a body rather than simply representing one.
Series shape Riefenstahl’s work, giving force not to individual shots but to multiplicities evoked across and in the between of shots. We watch not from shot to shot but from event to event.79 The event of the second series is how the woman becomes earth becomes sky, moving in relation with an atmospheric be- coming of nature. Watching her, we feel the delirium of another spiral emerging. As elsewhere in Riefenstahl, the creation of series opens the image to the trans- duction from immanent movement to the physical transcendental, where the physical connotes not how the image is represented but how it takes form in tan- dem with the shape-shifting of time and space. This shape-shifting is felt largely
