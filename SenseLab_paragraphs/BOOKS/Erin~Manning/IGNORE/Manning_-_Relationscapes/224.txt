The conjunctive force out of which a body is created is a biogram because of the ways in which it transforms what a body can do. Biograms work on the becoming-body. The biogram must not be thought as an image of the body. It is always deterritorialized. It holds nothing. It is a principle of conjugation, of consistency. It creates a texture before it coagulates into form. Better to say that the becoming-body “biograms.” To biogram is to create a virtual resonance that expresses the conjunction between series that prolong what a body can do. Not what movement is, but what movement can do.
We do not see the biogram: we feel the force of its appearance. The biogram provokes invention through its capacity to conjoin, or create new relations. Ac- cording to Whitehead, appearance brings forth novelty. “In all appearance there is an element of transmutation” (Whitehead 1933, 214). Transmutation from ap- pearance to disappearance is a shift in phase as well as a shift in mode. From the virtual to the actual, from the biogram to the becoming-body, is not a linear trans- port. It is a transmutation of process-becoming-form. In this intensive passage, the biogram constitutes active points of creation and potentiality through which body-worlds emerge. The biogram itself does not transmute. The biogram is
