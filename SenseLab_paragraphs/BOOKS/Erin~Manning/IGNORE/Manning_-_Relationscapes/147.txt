Étienne-Jules Marey (1830–1904) spent his life inventing machines to measure the imperceptible.61 He began this exploration of perception in the late 1850s with graph-writing instruments. These machines were concerned with measur- ing the body’s inner movements, calculating, for instance, the almost-invisible movements of the pulse’s rhythms and the blood’s flow by tracing them onto the surfaces of smoke-blackened cylinders. Over his research career, he devel- oped many such experimental machines ranging from inscription instruments to photographic apparatuses.
Marey’s focus was explicitly positivistic. His concern was to create machines to make visible what until then had remained invisible. This interest in invisibility led Marey toward an investment in the machinic, where the machinic is defined as an agglomeration of potential processes that exceed the limits of a particular mechanism. One of the most compelling aspects of Marey’s work is how the exploration of different modes of movement led him to devise techniques for perception that in turn became new kinds of sensing machines. Never quite satisfied with the results of his experiments, his life was dedicated to invention: he continuously created new experiments for which he had to build machines, and then built new machines based on the results of his experiments.
Marey’s focus on the invention of machines and processes to measure the imperceptible invariably led his research to become invested in the experiential.
