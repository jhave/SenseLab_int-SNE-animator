The will to power of the Dreaming is the capacity to affect and be affected. “The will to power manifests itself as the sensibility of force; the differential element of forces manifests itself as their differential sensibility” (Deleuze 1983, 62–63). What is felt through the Dreaming is the force of life, asking of life that it mani- fest itself again: “Was that life?” asks Nietzsche. “Well then! Once more!” (1961, 178). The coming to life through the Dreaming depends on the potential of the force of life itself. And yet, as manifested in Napangardi’s paintings, life and Dreaming coexist on the extensive continuum as one and the same, infinitely interwoven in an intensive movement of foreground and background. Popu- lated and populating, the Dreaming is an embodied contrast, a determinate fact that creates the potential for indeterminacy.121 Indeterminacy is essential as an intensive expanse for forces at play.
The event of force taking form is a definite fact with a date. In the becoming-active of force, a fight to the death has taken place between active and reactive forces. This becoming-active can never be felt as such—it can only be known in retrospect through the creation of novelty. Causing a change in nature, the becoming-active of force is a transmutation of value. “The transmuted feel- ing . . . is a definite physical fact whereby the final subject prehends the nexus” (Whitehead 1929/1978, 253). The becoming-active of force in Napangardi’s work is the activity of pulsation we feel through her work. There is a lot at stake in this work, which so masterfully plays the forces of containment against the
