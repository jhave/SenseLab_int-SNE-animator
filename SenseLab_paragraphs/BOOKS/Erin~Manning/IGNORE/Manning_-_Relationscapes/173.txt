An experimental result translated into quantitative fact is always judged ac- cording to external standards. It is read according to predetermined parameters that stabilize the inquiry by assuming that what is measured can be dissociated from the whole: positivism takes for granted that at least part of the system is stable. In Marey’s case, what seems at first not to be open to experimentation is the body itself: in his book on movement, he never questions the givenness of the body. And yet, what is fascinating about his research as it progresses is how the body does become part of the inquiry. Over the course of his career, he ends up inventing modes for visualizing individuation, a practice of processual intervention into what constitutes a body in movement. His research becomes one invested both in measuring movement and creating modes of perception for the ineffable: the body-becoming. This unresolved tension in Marey’s work between the rational and the radical leads to a constant tinkering with the me- chanics of invention such that quantity and quality become intermixed and their complex environment—their associated milieu—actually becomes the object of study.
