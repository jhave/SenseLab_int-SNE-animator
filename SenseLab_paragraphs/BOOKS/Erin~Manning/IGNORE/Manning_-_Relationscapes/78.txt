toward before leading the direction I now expect her to follow. She moves where the movement was moving us—where I thought about going—rather than where I went. Although I never actually moved where the relation was moving, she felt a kind of doubled force of movement moving and responded to its first tendency: the direction I thought I had not led. She moved into my hesitation. Of course, this is part of moving together. At best, my response will be to follow her lead, moving-with the force of the initial preacceleration into the experien- tial space-time I didn’t think I had opened up. Rhythms are never predictable.
What we want to avoid is a falling-into. We want to nurture the elasticity of movement moving, and for that reason, we want to be in sync with the force of our relation as it develops. If we lose this intensity of force taking form, what we have first and foremost is a step.
Relational movement produces a curve or curvature. The elasticity is felt more than seen. It is an intensive curve that was never led as such, because created relationally. The law of curvature is the law of folds, and folds have a tendency to refold, to pleat, to crease, to wrinkle. As the fold compresses, what results is not necessarily a smaller movement but a more intensively compact one. This compactness produces a force that opens the movement to its taking-form. The curve does not result from the movement. The curve is the movement, a contraction into an elasticity that moves the relation. The body-elastic is pure plastic rhythm, the body of the between where the movement is on the verge, quasi-actual, almost virtual, hanging, pulsing, spiraling.
