gesture risks breaking movement into bits of assimilable data, replicating the very conformity the computer-dancer interface is seeking to get beyond.
Instead of attempting to map gesture, this chapter therefore begins some- where else. It explores the potential of the wholeness of movement, including its “unmappable” virtuality. The unmappable—within a computer software program—is the aspect of movement I call preacceleration, a tendency toward movement through which a displacement takes form. Due to gesture’s implicit relationship with displacement, vocabularies of gesture tend to overlook preac- celeration. A focus on gesture (defined as extensive displacement of body parts divisible from a wholeness of movement) tends to lose sight of movement’s in- cipiency, thus overlooking the virtual opening these sensitive technologies wish to encounter. If a vocabulary of gesture is to be reclaimed as part of what can be stimulated in the encounter between dance and new technology, I believe it must be done through the continuum of movement, through the body’s emergence in the realm of the virtual becoming of preacceleration. Rather than molding the body to the measure of motion-detecting technology, I propose we begin with pure plastic rhythm, situating the sensing body in movement in a mutating ma- trix of technological becoming. Let’s call this body-emergent technogenetic.
