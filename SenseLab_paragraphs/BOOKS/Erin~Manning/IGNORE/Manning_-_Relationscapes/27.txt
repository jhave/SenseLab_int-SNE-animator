Concepts are events in the making. An event in the making is a thought on the cusp of articulation—a prearticulated thought in motion. How thoughts in mo- tion become articulations is the subject of Relationscapes: Movement, Art, Phi- losophy. Throughout, my concern is to address the malleability of concepts that move, the expressivity of thoughts as they become feelings, the ontogenetic po- tential of ideas as they become articulations. This complex passage from thought to feeling to concepts-in-prearticulation to events-in-the-making foregrounds how thinking is more than the discrete final form it takes in language. To come to language is more than to finalize form. To come to language is to feel the form-taking of concepts as they prearticulate thoughts/feelings.
Many concepts are at work in Relationscapes. This proliferation of concepts builds on the necessity for language to create new parameters for thought in the passage from feeling to articulation. To create concepts is to move with lan- guage’s prearticulations. In this mode of thinking/ feeling, language does not yet know what it means. It has not yet defined where it can go. Language is cre- atively mired within the affective tonalities of how it can be heard, lived, written, imagined.
To arrive at language in the making, Relationscapes begins with the concept not of prearticulation but of preacceleration. The reason for this is that to think language before it takes form we must first understand how to conceive of taking form itself. Taking form, I suggest, is key to a developing vocabulary of move- ment that foregrounds incipience rather than displacement. What I mean by
