And yet, as though called back by the transcendental of fascist doxa, the body suddenly becomes disciplined, all subtlety cast aside. As though in direct con- tact with the transcendent disciplinarity of the absolute state, the undulating series of pins-bodies dancing organizes itself in firm, straight lines. From flow to square, from becoming to being, the camera reveals a sudden materializing of the plane of organization. Physical transcendence always risks being captured by the war machine of the totalitarian state.
Riefenstahl’s films develop the concept of dynamic form in Boccioni and the mobile cut in Deleuze/Bergson to arrive at a reassertion of the ways in which movement privileges expression over content. The foregrounding of dynamic form suggests that Riefenstahl composes with fascism but does not com- pose a fascist (disciplinary) body. What she composes is the expression of a becoming-body symbiotically linked to fascism but in excess of its disciplinarity. Riefenstahl composes-with. She begins with the beautiful, the young, the strong, but what she composes is never a particular or individual body. Movement is the commanding form of her work.
Commanding form is how the virtuality of a work connects to the manner in which a work reiteratively takes form.82 In music, it refers to what sustains a work in the repetition of its playings. When we experience Riefenstahl’s work, it is important to ask how it takes form today, how its reiteration over more than a half century sustains itself, how the shape-taking and the form-finding of her images continue to resonate. A work’s commanding form is not associ- ated to a moral imperative. Riefenstahl’s images will never be disconnected from fascism. The point is not to attempt to do so but to evolve with them to connect to the force of their physicality within the transcendence her work forecasts.
