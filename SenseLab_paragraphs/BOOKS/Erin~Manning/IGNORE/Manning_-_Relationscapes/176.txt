As the co-arising impulse to measure and experience coalesce within Mar- ey’s work, what increasingly emerge are movement machines—machines that do not strictly represent movement but create new modalities of perception. These machines produce more than results. They produce novelty, which sparks thought, which leads to more experimentation. Movement research that may have begun as an exploration of an already-constituted reality becomes a ma- chinic intervention into the not-yet-seen. While Marey-the-positivist continu- ously strives toward creating more accurate techniques for the measuring of movement, Marey-the-radical-empiricist creates speculative assemblages that induce complex sensations in the name of the perception of perception. The irony: the degree of precision he seeks in the production of quantifiable results contributes to the creation of event-based machines that provoke an active cou- pling of movement, bodies and milieu.
Multiplicities are evoked in Marey’s work both quantitatively and qualita- tively. They figure as quantities-for-measure and intensities-in-process. In- tensity can never be measured since to measure would immediately interrupt duration, transforming force into form. Yet in the experience of the elasticity of the almost, the virtual resonance of intensity can be felt as movement moves through an actualizing form. While the intensity of passage is not present in the final concrescence of the form, it remains part of the feeling co-arising with
