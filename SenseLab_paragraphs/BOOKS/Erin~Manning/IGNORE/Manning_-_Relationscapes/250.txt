produce difference each time. It must be open, yet controlled. In Riefenstahl, the sum is dense with rhythm. It is dense with the constraint of the structure of com- position that will culminate in a polyrhythmic movement-image that works. To work, the polyrhythm must produce the effect of an overlayering, whereby the body expresses itself electrically even while it backgrounds itself atmospheri- cally. The body-becoming is the protagonist onto which polyrhythmic surfaces expand, fold, bend, emerge, collapse. For Dalcroze, musical rhythms can be ap- preciated only in relation to the atmosphere and space in which they move, only in relation to silence and immobility. “Musical rhythmics is the art of establish- ing due proportion between sound movement and static silence, of opposing them, and of preparing for the one by means of the other, according to the laws of contrast and balance on which all style depends” (Dalcroze 1921, 149).
