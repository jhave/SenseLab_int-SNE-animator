Creating an actual occasion harnesses an event, foreclosing momentarily the potential for recombination. There will of course be simultaneous re- combinations at the level of the nexus, but a singular actual occasion—like Gottfried Leibniz’s monads—will always remain what it is in this instance. When this instance has outgrown its potential, the actual occasion will per- ish, leaving an opening for a repopulation of the recomposing nexus. Only the interval will survive this perishing. Although the interval as such can never be grasped or contained, it “ingresses” into new actual occasions, magnify- ing the potential within them. This shape-shifting of the interval is a rhythm that returns as a refrain, emphasizing that which populates the in-between. There is no empty space: space is the interval that creates refrains, rhythmically altering body-worlds.
The refrain is used here to convey time-slips within territorializations. To territorialize is always to stop movement, to begin the analysis from a stopping, and then to make the body move. To think movement through the refrain al- lows us to locate the interval as an absolute tempo whereby “time ceases to be exterior in order to become an intensive nucleus [ foyer] of temporalization” (Guattari 1995, 16). Rhythm is experiential duration that dislodges any concept of universal time. “From this perspective, universal time appears to be no more than a hypothetical projection, a time of generalized equivalence, a ‘flattened’ capitalist time; what is important are these partial modules of temporalization, operating in diverse domains (biological, ethological, socio-cultural, machinic,
