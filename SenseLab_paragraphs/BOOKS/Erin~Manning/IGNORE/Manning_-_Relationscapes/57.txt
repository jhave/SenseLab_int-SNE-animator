Repetition is at the heart of the interval. The structure of repetition-in-duration is not one of resemblance but of difference. This repetition takes place within the virtual potential that is translated into an actual movement. The interval provokes the movement but does not actually move. The body moves. Rep- etition is the recomposing of the moving-with that is the relational body. This movement-with can be a spiral of preacceleration that incites a displacement, or it can be a movement of thought. It is always repetition with a difference. When this difference takes form, it becomes an actuality, an event in and of itself. This becoming-event creates a memory that feeds into future movement. Moving is repeating the future: dancing the not-yet. “What is recollected . . . is repeated backwards, whereas repetition is recollected forwards” (Kierkegaard 1983, 131).
Preacceleration is tapped into by the interval, actualized not in the displace- ment as such but in the potential of its actualization. Preacceleration is like the breath that releases speech, the gathering-toward that leaps our bodies into a future unknowable. It goes something like this: preacceleration—relation—in- terval—intensification—actualization—extension—displacement—preaccel- eration. Simultaneity of experience creates sensing bodies in movement creates shifting space-times of experience. “Space . . . is not matter or extension but the schema of matter, that is, the representation of the limit where the move- ment of expansion (détente) would come to an end as the external envelope of all possible extensions” (Deleuze 1991a, 87). Bodies are never independent of the extensions of space and the matter of time: bodies are durational. The interval makes this duration manifest, virtually.
