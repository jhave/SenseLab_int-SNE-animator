an operational vector in the transmutation from one series to another. As an agent of recombination, the biogram is not actually in time or in space: it is a force through which the imperceptible appears as a feltness of time spacing. The biogram has neither form nor content. It is the intensive passage from force to force that moves a body to express its durational intensity.
Biogrammatic movement in Riefenstahl is a thrownness felt as the preac- celeration of a body-becoming. Alive in the virtual nodes of the between that composes the images as series, the biogram functions like the persistence of vision in the unaccountable shift from force to form. It makes the interval felt. “On account of the persistency of an image upon the retina, moving objects constantly multiply themselves; their form changes like rapid vibrations, in their mad career” (Boccioni 1970a, 27–28). The mad career of Riefenstahl’s art is its incitement to transduce, to become-across in a shattering of the absoluteness of the frame.
