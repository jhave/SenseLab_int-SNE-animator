The elasticity of the almost is part of the curve. It is the curve’s point of inflec- tion. “Inflection is . . . the elastic point” (Deleuze 1988a, 20). Inflection is the genetic element of the active line. It is not a hard point, nor is it a point directed from outside the movement. The elastic point is of the movement. It is that which culls from the movement’s potential its becoming-form. This singularity carries the curve, is the event of the curve. This singularity is what expresses the virtual fullness of the interval, its plenitude. This plenitude is the worlding of the movement. That interval is worlding does not mean that it contains the world, but that it potentially expresses the infradimensional, which is the worlding of pure plastic rhythm.
Inflection gives expression to this worlding, and in the elasticity of its activ- ity, it makes palpable the tangibility of sensation. As the movement perishes,
