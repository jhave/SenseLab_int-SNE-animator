When movement is conceptualized as an add-on to the sculpting of matter— when environment, atmosphere, preexists the sculpture—movement becomes indexical to space. We are left with movement as defined only by the actual bodies taking a stroll around the sculpture. To say that a sculpture moves is to say something entirely different: it is to suggest that form becomes matter in the mattering of form. It is to say that dynamic form is the molecular transduction that creates space rather than inhabiting it, physically transcending matter as precomposed form. Sculptural exfoliation. When the sculpture physically tran- scends its materiality, it does not become any less material. A becoming-body takes form that is neither strictly sculptural nor strictly physical: physical transcendence.
Physical transcendence involves transmutation from force to form, where the force field continues to be immanent to the experience of the taking-form. Transmutation produces not simply a change of state; it invents a new process. Physical transcendentalism for Boccioni is immanently material, material not in the sense of material stability (if there were such a thing) but in the sense of the becoming-molecular of matter’s virtual tendencies. An event is physically transcendental when the virtuality of force is felt in and through the material stratum, such that its materiality exposes and makes felt the virtual potential of its force. The physical transcendental is the mobile cut that produces “mysteri- ous affinities which create formal and reciprocal influences between the differ- ent planes of an object” (Boccioni 1970b, 61).
