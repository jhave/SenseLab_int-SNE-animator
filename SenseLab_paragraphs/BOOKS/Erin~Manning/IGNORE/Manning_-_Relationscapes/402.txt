41. For more on the machinic, see Deleuze and Guattari 1987. See also Guattari 1995.
42. For more on Artaud’s concept of the Body without Organs, see Deleuze and Guattari 1987.
43. For a reading of the posthuman, see Hayles 2000.
44. Richard Beardsworth is influenced by Jacques Derrida in his usage of originary tech- nicity. It comes up in many of Beardsworth’s texts. For an example of how he uses origi- nary technicity in his work, see http://tekhnema.free.fr/3editorial.htm.
45. There is new work in technology and dance that has evolved beyond the use of the prosthetic, and as the field develops, we will no doubt see new and inventive ways of thinking the technogenetic body. One new direction includes biotechnological art (see Yann Marussich’s Bleu Provisoire [2001, http://www.yannmarussich.ch/?m1=2&p=7], which uses biochemical reactions as the central node of the piece).
46. For an analysis of interactivity, see Massumi and Dove 1999.
47. There is of course no telling what technology will be able to do in the future. How- ever the relationship between bodies and technology develops, this junction will likely be most creative when each aspect of the work is opened to its technogenetic limit. However interesting technology becomes, without a lively vocabulary for the moving body, the technology will remain a tool rather than a technique for discovery.
48. For more on the ways in which actual occasions are always contemporarily indepen- dent events, see Whitehead 1933.
49. On the half-second delay of perception, see Whitehead 1933. See also Massumi 2002.
50. For a stimulating reading of active recollection in Bergsonian thought, see Deleuze 1991b.
51. Whitehead defines organisms according to their perceptual capacities, making a dif- ference between what he calls “lower grade” and “higher grade” organisms. An example of a lower grade organism engaged in perception would be the causal relation between flower and sun that causes the flower to turn to the sun. See Whitehead, Adventures of Ideas.
52. The idea of breathing space is evocatively brought forward by Michael Schumacher in Christopher Salter’s 2007 piece entitled Thresholds/Schwelle. In this piece, Schumacher recomposes space-time through the tactility of breath.
53. See the chapter of the same name in Massumi 2002.
54. Stelarc’s work is evocative in relation to technogenesis. For a stimulating reading of his work, see Massumi, “The Evolutionary Alchemy of Reason,” chapter 4 in Massumi 2002.
