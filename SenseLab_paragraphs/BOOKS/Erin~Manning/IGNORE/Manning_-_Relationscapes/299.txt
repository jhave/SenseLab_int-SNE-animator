Although most topologies are non-Euclidean, topologies are not necessarily non-Euclidean. The effort here is not to create a dichotomy that would suggest that there are specific experiential states to which the Central Desert Aborigines have direct access, as opposed to the spiritually impoverished urban dweller who can only think in terms of Euclidean coordinates. The point is rather that expe- riential space is topological and gets regridded within Cartesian coordinates, in part because such geometric grammars seem easier to capture. To think topo- logically is to think dynamically: it is to situate the movement of thought at its transformational vector, deforming it into its potential. When we rerender the form static, when we stop the process, we are shortchanging the experience.
Within topological transformation, an infinite number of static structures can emerge. This might begin to explain the complexity of Aboriginal life today. To suggest that Aboriginals live exclusively in transformation would be as sense- less as to say that all urban dwellers are only sustained by Cartesian maps. The potential of experiential space is everywhere present. The question is how we map it, how we live it, how it transforms us. The transformation of a topological figure into a static instance creates an object. This object—be it a doughnut or a coffee cup, both of which belong to the same topological figure—stands for itself. What is interesting about it is not necessarily its shape but its process: the fact that its ontology is one of continuous deformation. To create an object is one thing—to create a relationscape another.
