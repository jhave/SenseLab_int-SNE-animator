108. This differs from the standard practice, where dark colors are gessoed onto the canvas.
109. Gilles Deleuze argues that the figure and the figurative are not the same. For a more detailed explanation, see his work on Bacon (Deleuze 2003).
110. Videos of Kngwarreye painting give a sense of her practice of dancing-while-painting.
111. Deleuze writes: “So the act of painting is always shifting, it is constantly oscillating between a beforehand and an afterward: the hysteria of painting” (2003, 80).

113. In “Grounded Abstraction: The work of Dorothy Napangardi,” Christine Nicholls tells Dorothy Napangardi’s story: until Napangardi was about seven or eight years old, the extended family traveled around the Mina Mina area, living on the bush tucker, and drinking from its soakages and claypans. The gold rushes of 1910 and 1932 had brought prospectors on to Warlpiri lands, and the beginnings of pastoral settlement in 1917 to the west brought more non-indigenous interlopers. Colonial expansion meant that the best waterholes and soakages were often expropriated to support the growth of the cattle industry. In 1957 Napangardi’s family was moved to Yuendumu under pressure under the Assimilation Policy. Later, the entire family absconded back to Mina Mina. Currently, Napangardi lives in Alice Springs. See Nicholls 2002.
114. Some of the Sandhills paintings are as small as 30cm x 30 cm.
115. The extensive continuum is one of the key concepts in Whitehead’s process phi- losophy. It underlies the whole world, past, present, and future. In and of itself, it has no properties. It is what gives consistency to a world in the making. “The properties of this continuum are very few and do not include the relationships of metrical geometry. An extensive continuum is a complex of entities united by the various allied relationships of whole to part, and of overlapping so as to possess common parts, and of contact, and of other relationships derived from these primary relationships” (Whitehead 1938, 62).
116. In A Thousand Plateaus, Deleuze and Guattari underline the fact that events are always associated to singular places and times, hence the dating of each of the plateaus.
117. This Dreaming is also called Kana-Karlangu and alternately refers to the “Digging- Stick Possessing-Dreaming” and the “Women-Belonging-Dreaming.” The story is told by Punayi (Jeannie) Herbert Nungarrayi—as it was related to her, by her elders from the Kunajarrayi side, who own part of the Dreaming—in the introduction to Dancing Up Country: The Art of Dorothy Napangardi.
118. Nicholls tells this story in Dancing Up Country. See Nicholls 2002.
