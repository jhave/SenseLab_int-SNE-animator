through the affective tonality—the atmospheric lightness, in this case—of the series. Affective tonality is key to how the series develop alongside the “content” of the film, allowing the film to take shape on multiple levels at once. Even as the shots glean their shape from images of the young, beautiful, strong Olympian body, what emerges through the multiplicity of resonant images is not a discrete individual but a becoming-shape of movement.
Riefenstahl creates the becoming-body of the second series out of a trans- duction of consistency into shape, grass + arms. Hers is the creation of a dance transcendent and yet immanently material. Throughout, this immanent mate- riality is foregrounded, a materiality that takes form as a body-becoming. This body-becoming evokes a physical transcendentalism—physical in its material- ity, transcendental in its immanence. What dances is not the body as such but the between of the series, its interval. This interval—what I will call a biogram80
–shapes the form of Riefenstahl’s work.
Olympia never introduces a stable body. Rather, she foregrounds a body that provokes relations between nodes of appearance-disappearance that take form through images intense in their capacity to shape-shift. The body always appears in its splendid materiality at the very cusp of its disappearance. This body-becoming is as alive as the light dancing in the arms-grass-hoop series, and as virtual as the fluid movements of stone, embodying an aesthetics both terrifyingly fascist and biopolitically inventive. This fascism is not “ready- made,” not located in the body as already-formed. In Olympia we encounter a much more evasive fascism: the fascism of the in-between where biopolitics calls forth a biogram.
