the preacceleration of a new occasion of experience. Once the subjective form composes itself, the experience has been constituted, and the event is nearing its completion. It has done its work. To feel the elasticity is always to know we are on the edge. When the elastic contracts, we feel at once the perishing of the event and the propulsion of the next preacceleration. This is because the elastic force is as present in its stretching as in its contraction, always stimulating the intensive spiral of a new becoming-movement.
Perished actual occasions populate the nexus out of which experience is made. There is no movement that is not nested within another movement with which it is in continuity. As events become and perish, they create openings for new events. Every opening in relational movement marks the potential for an infinity of approaches. “When they perish, occasions pass from the immediacy of being into the non-being of immediacy” (Whitehead 1933, 237). Events do not perish into nothingness. Like memories, they can be reactivated. To reactivate an event is not to recreate the same movement again but to invent a new movement that calls forth a certain array of recognizable elastic points. This new movement will be virtually populated with the pastness that constitutes the experience of moving in that way. In relational movement, once I know that it is possible for my body to move a certain way, it is much more likely I will experiment with that way of moving. Whitehead calls these “non-beings of immediacy” that populate this feeling of knowing in relational movement stubborn facts. They are stub- born because we are never completely free of them. They tense up our shoulders, lock our knees. But they also teach us techniques that open up possibilities for movement that in turn become emergent potentialities, proposing entries into otherwise impossibly small holes, inviting us to move-with in ways which even yesterday we wouldn’t have imagined possible.
