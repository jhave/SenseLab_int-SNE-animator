through the creation of new experiments. Through this singular associated mi- lieu, Marey’s research alters the ecologies of practices out of which it builds. His work pushes the limits of positivism and brings complexity to the exploration of the concept of relation that is at the heart of radical empiricism.
Since relations are always of different degrees of intimacy, measure does not suffice to make them known. What is necessary is a technique of the in- between that does not seek to assess only the form-as-such (the object, the body) but that is also invested in the milieu through which it comes into emer- gence. All of Marey’s work operates through this tensile environment between measure-representation and rhythm-relation. This is a productive tension, fas- cinating in the way it challenges Marey’s commitment to positivist science and its modalities of measure. He produces, it seems, a continual doubling of experi- mentation, where he posits the result as the culmination, even while he continues to rebuild the machine that in its next rendition will open incipient movement toward new vistas of unmappability. If Marey were content with measure as such, there would be no need for a new machine, or a more complex technical system. Yet he keeps devising them, creating not only new machinic processes but new techniques of relation, plotting not representational movement in its discrete elements but relational movement, expressed through its incipiency.
