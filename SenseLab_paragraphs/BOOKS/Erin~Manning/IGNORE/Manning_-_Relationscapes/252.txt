Riefenstahl works with the immanence of movement, biogrammatically ren- dering apparent time within movement. From within this process of making duration felt, she releases rhythm, actively pulling force out of the incipiency of movement, inciting it to appear. Through her play of appearance/disappearance, Riefenstahl creates a time-image of the movement-image, resolutely impregnat- ing one with the other, creating superimposed, heterogeneous, divergent series that operate in polyrhythmic continuity within the same continuous movement. Every movement-with occurs durationally. In Whiteheadian terms, what Rie- fenstahl does is make time of the order of appearance without backgrounding movement.
The time of movement is dynamic form. Dynamic form appears in the rela- tion not from body to body but from rhythm to rhythm. An open whole— an atmospherics—is what preoccupies each of Riefenstahl’s images. This whole-which-has-no-parts cannot be divided without changing qualitatively at each stage of the division. Think of the diving sequence. As the women fly off the diving board, they emerge first as individuals, one after the other, named, but soon, and even more so when the sequence shifts to the male divers, a fly- ing takes place where the bodies become-sky, dancing their folds and surfaces in a relatedness that exceeds their individuality. There is no foregrounded in- dividual in these sequences. We take part in a biogram that is a becoming-sky that couples flight and falling, landing, and surfacing. Duration is felt not as measure but as ascending rhythms. The dive itself disappears, and what takes
