A fissure emerges between cognitive mapping and orientation. What Clifford Possum is trying to do with his great maps is to orient the Dreamings in relation not to a void but to a becoming-body of the future-past. To orient is to actively engage in the process of mapping. It is to make maps even as we read them. This has for thousands of years been the practice of the Aboriginals of the desert, a practice that has taken the form, among others, of drawing in the sand. These traces—the shapes in the sand—were used to teach people about time and space as they intersect. To draw a circle could mean many things: a campfire, a water- hole. What is important—and how their “meanings” are read—depends on the direct perception of relation as it takes form. What such mappings teach is to locate an intensity of reaching-toward, not an entity.
What is calculated in the mapping is experience + ability. If you ask Clifford Possum about distance, he will speak in terms of walking days, or car hours. How do I get there? The “how” of directionality creates a permutation such that space-time shapes itself around continuous shiftings. The ground trembles. The desert is not one space: it is many overlapping space-times of experience that Aboriginals call Dreamings. These Dreamings can be drawn into maps, but such maps will never lead us anywhere if we expect them to do the walking for us.
