Music is central to this process. The music in Olympia is visual as much as the becoming-body is musical. Music is never backgrounded: it is the intensive con- nective tissue for the physical transcendental.
The merging of series is as essential for the biogram as are the series themselves. Returning to the discus-thrower in Olympia, we watch the becoming-body merge with the thrownness and then with the becoming-sky becoming-earth of the women dancing. We soon find we cannot feel where one series begins and ends. The atmospheric sky-landscape becomes the throwing body becomes the dancing body, a multiplicity. This becoming-multiple is not necessarily the becoming-human of the multiple. It is also the becoming-hoop of the thrownness, the becoming-grass of the dancing, the becoming-sky of the arms moving. Bodies culminate as intensive surfaces that intertwine and fold one into another intensively, extensively. Then the becoming-body that was never quite man nor woman, yet also singularly both, becomes fire in a transformation that recalls the phoenix. We perceive not the representation of the phoenix but the becoming-fire itself, the plane of experience of movement in the making.
