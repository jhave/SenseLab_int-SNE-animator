The biogram makes itself felt in the intensive passage from one intensity— one series—to another. This shift is never a passive transition that leaves two series intact. It is a transmutation, the biogram the virtual node between the series. The biogram carries the movement of the event even before the event has expressed itself as such. The biogram cannot represent anything because it has no pregiven form. It creates out of the plane of consistency that it preempts. It is diagrammatic because it has not yet determined its function. It resides on the plane of consistency because this is the plane of incipient relationality. The biogram propels a process of determining that always resists final form. It is a relational concept that operates at once from within the series and at the edges of its deterritorialization.
The biogram works in a strange paradox of time. Take the series javelin- ball-discus. This series connects to itself through the repetition of the act of throwing. This repetition is already a difference, not only because of the differ- ent bodies or because of the different objects, but because each preacceleration of the throwing body qualitatively alters both what a body can do and what an image can do. Thrownness becomes body. Yet the becoming-body takes form only retrospectively in the biogrammatic conjunction of the series. What conju- gates the series is the fact that a body will emerge. Composing the image while keeping its potential for flow alive is one of Riefenstahl’s remarkable strengths.
