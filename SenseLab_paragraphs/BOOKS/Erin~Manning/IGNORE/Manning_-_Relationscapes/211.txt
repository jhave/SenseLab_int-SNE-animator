in Triumph of the Will (1935) where Riefenstahl films the approach of Hitler, Himmler, and Hess. As we watch the three figures moving toward us, the camera pans from behind large columns, repeatedly blocking our view. The paradox of this technique is that the momentary and repeated obfuscation of Hitler, Him- mler, and Hessâ€™s physical presence has the uncanny effect of intensifying the event of their arrival. We feel the virtual force of their importance through the disappearance of their actual bodies. A similar effect is produced in the first scene of Olympia as the camera approaches the Parthenon.
In this approach, the camera pauses at the movement of the grass billowing between the stone ruins. We feel the Parthenon gaining on us before we see it. The grass catches the wind, its ephemeral movement lending affective tone to the stone surfaces. What we see is imbued with the feeling of what we cannot see: the image resounds with intensive movement. Then the ultimate appear- ance of the imposing remainder of a lost era: a long shot of the Parthenon in full center. The play here is between materiality and fluidity. The material is the density of the ruin, the fluidity of grace taking form in the intensive passage between appearance and disappearance.
Then a face, made of stone and yet almost alive, the almost-flesh of the sculp- ture caught in a dissolve as the music quietens. Trumpets sound and another stone face enters the image in close-up against a dark background, caught in the between of night and day. As though from below, the next stone figure ap- pears, moving still, shifting into the disappearance of the face that came before.
