The last thing I want to do is to deny the complexity of power and the ways in which it sidelines populations. Indeed, what is important here is precisely the question of how an emphasis on the in-act of event-time opens the way for a rethinking of power and the politics that accompanies it. Focusing on agencement instead of agency, I want to argue, allows us not only to value modes of experience backgrounded in the account of agency, it also shakes the powerful foundations of neurotypicality, a mode of existence that profoundly devalues accounts of experience that cannot be reduced to the volition-intentionality-agency triad.
