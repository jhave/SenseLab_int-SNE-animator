A beautiful example of what facilitation can do is seen in the poetic writings of what Ralph Savarese calls autie-type. Autie-type, as mentioned above, is the name Savarese gives to the rhythm and metaphor he sees in autistics who use facilitated communication. Sometimes this poetics weaves through their writings for years after they have come to typing (Larry Bissonnette is a good example of this), other times, as in Blackmanâ€™s musings on the loss of her poetic voice, the autie-type rhythms can become backgrounded. Either way, certain patterns in the writing are palpable, and this even across cultures and languages.
