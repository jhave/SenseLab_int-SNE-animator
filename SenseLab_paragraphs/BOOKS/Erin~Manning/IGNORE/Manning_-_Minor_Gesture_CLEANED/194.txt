Contemplation makes the artful felt. It does so in the event, in the uneasy balance between seeding a practice and becoming-with a practice. Here, in the midst of life-living, artfulness reminds us that the “I” is not where life begins, and the “you” is not what makes it art. Made up as it is of a thousand contemplations, the art of time reminds us that “we [must] speak of the self only in virtue of these thousands of little witnesses which contemplate within us: it is always a third party who says ‘me’” (Deleuze 1978: 75). This is why artfulness is rarer than art. For artfulness depends on so many tendings, so many implicit collaborations between intuition and sympathy. And more than all else, it depends on the human getting out of the way.
