On the continuum of reason as defined by Whitehead we find another key concept of his process philosophy: mentality. Mentality is the force that propels the physical beyond its mere life toward quality of existence. Each occasion of experience, for Whitehead, is both physical and mental. What is crucial is to understand that the mental and the physical are not mind/body (or body and consciousness) but differential aspects of one complex relational process directed by the occasion’s coming to be. The physical is that which persists in conformity with past forms. The mental is what troubles the conformity, opening the event to its more-than. “Mental experience,” Whitehead writes, “is the experience of forms of definiteness in respect to their disconnection from any particular physical experience, but with abstract evaluation of what they can contribute to such experience” (1929: 32).
