Serialities in the making rely on the conditions that support their retelling. Neurotypicality is one of those conditions from which the cut of subjectivity is persistently defined. The idea of the neurotypical as building block of human existence is so pervasive that not only is it rarely recognized as such, but most of us have overlooked the ways neurotypicality structures our original myths, starting from the idea that humans are distinctly above all other forms of life and extending all the way to the idea that certain forms of human life are more worthwhile than others. As I mention in the introduction, this has had an effect on how we value not only different forms of organic and inorganic existence, but also forms of human difference. Think, again, of the general belief that Down syndrome is not a worthwhile life. Or think of the ways in which disabled people are infantilized, and often mistreated in institutions. Think also of the high unemployment of people with disabilities. Or think of the destructive ways in which the cure-focused Autism Speaks devalues autistic experience.6 Or think of the ways women have been segregated out of certain professions because of norms around intelligence that exclude them.7 Or think of the legacy of Indigenous politics and the ways in which Indigenous people are ignored, abused, excluded.8 Neurotypicality takes for granted what the human should be and by extension limits the breadth of what a human subjectivity might look like. Here, a kind of mutated natural selection is still at work that believes that the fittest (those we’ve already given the title to) are the ones to whose image we must conform. The neurotypical mantra “I can,” based on a very narrow definition of volition, deactivates experience rather than opening it to its potential. If I can’t, what’s the use?
