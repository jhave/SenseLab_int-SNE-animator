Placing “carrying” in front of words is a way of inscribing, for thought and language, this necessity of relation, foregrounding how each act necessitates its own variety of carrying across the field of experience. For Blackman, touch does a lot of this carrying. Speaking of how touch facilitates the process of coming to language, she writes: “What I did not realize then was that when I tried to plan [a] movement, I was unaware of the exact position of my fingertip in time and space, much as I was uncomfortable walking on slopes because my foot and my sight were sufficiently out of sync to make me uncertain as to the exact moment my sole could start to bear my weight” (2013: 23). Facilitation, she continues, was capable of “unlock[ing] purposeful movement” (2013: 21). “A hand on my arm or wrist makes a comfortable control, and a continual challenge by the difficulties of sustaining my concentration makes coherent language overcome the intellectual cascades of my internal thoughts” (2013: 35). Even when Blackman no longer needed hands-on facilitation to write, she continued to feel strongly that the “reciprocity” of facilitation was essential. To repeat: “All I know is that some kind of touch or reciprocity makes me calmer, and the greater certainty of success in hitting the key that I visualize means that I can express the visual language which for so many years I had been cherishing” (2013: 35).
