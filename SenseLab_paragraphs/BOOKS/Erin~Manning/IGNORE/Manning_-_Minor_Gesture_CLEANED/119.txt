Taking a stand in the midst is a messy proposition—the image that comes to mind is of being barefoot in a pile of grapes, assisting them in their process of fermentation. In the grapes, the process is directly felt, if not quite understood in its minutiae, and, to push the image further, it will no doubt leave stains. Reading or making are as messy, as uneasy-making, as exciting as pounding the grapes, provided that we take this situatedness seriously. For it is in the midst of the field of relations, in the undercommons, that practices are at their most inventive, at their most intense. This is also, of course, the place of risk. All that work, and the wine may still turn. Or just never be any good. The same goes for the sympathetic reading that creates a concept, or the artistic process that activates an object. These may go nowhere. But what they will do, no matter what, is create a process and, even better, a practice, and it is this that will have made a difference. For it will have made felt the urge of appetition, and with it the work’s affirmation of the not-yet.
