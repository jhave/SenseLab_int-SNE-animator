Modes of existence are less species than speciations, where speciation is understood as an emergent field of relation.2 They are speciations because they don’t fit into existence preformed but activate the minor gestures of its most potentializing edgings into experience, pushing existence to its intensive limit. They are speciations because they don’t name a state, but activate ecologies that in turn activate differential tendencies in the milieu of their co-composition. Modes of existence act, cut, reorient: they are worldconstituting procedures.
