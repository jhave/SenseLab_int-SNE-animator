Simondon writes: “Couldn’t we conceive of individuation as being . . . a process intrinsic to the formation of individuals, never achieved, never fixed, never stable, but always realizing, in their evolution, an individuation that structures them without eliminating the associated charge of the preindividual, constituting the horizon of transindividual Being from which they detach themselves?” (2005: 13). The transindividual, it bears repeating, “is neither raw sociality nor the interindividual; it presupposes a veritable operation of individuation from a preindividual reality” (2005: 13). Preindividual reality, the charge of the more-than that accompanies all processes of individuation, creates not an individual formed once and for all, but a metastability that expresses “a quantum condition, correlative of a plurality of orders of magnitude” (2005: 13). It is from the perspective of this metastability that the crafting, in an artistic process, of the art of participation can begin, a crafting that takes the event as participatory at its core, a process always in co-composition across the scales and times of its making.
