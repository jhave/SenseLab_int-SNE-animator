The minor and the major are not opposed. They are variabilities in differential co-composition. Speaking of minor literatures, Deleuze and Guattari write: “Minor languages are characterized not by overload and poverty in relation to a standard or major language, but by a sobriety and variation that are like a minor treatment of the standard language, a becoming-minor of the major language. . . . Minor languages do not exist in themselves: they exist only in relation to a major language and are also investments of that language for the purpose of making it minor” (1987: 104–105).
In the context of research-creation, the question is how a practice is capable of opening up the field such that minor gestures can emerge, this despite the value placed on the more recognizable and predictable grand gestures. Grand gestures carry with them a degree of the spectacular. They connect into concerns “of the day” in ways that further cement already existent stakes. They give us categories to separate out “good” work from “bad” work, the valuable from the overlookable. They connect to what is considered “current.” Both grand and minor gestures are active in and activated by the major languages that seek to frame them, such as the university and the contemporary art institution, and are often interwoven. Despite the ways the grand gesture overshadows the minor, minor gestures nonetheless course through all events. It is therefore less a question of placing one gesture against the other than it is of exploring what kinds of conditions foster the capture of the minor by the major. The focus here is not on how to “make” a minor gesture, or how to resist a grand gesture, but on how to develop techniques that allow the singularity of a gesture that opens the work to its workings to come to the fore, how to invent techniques that resist immediate capture by the major.
