In the context of writing, Blackman describes facilitation as regulating an impulse. Her words simply don’t transfer to the keyboard easily. She writes: “In my mind I feel as if my hand is moving in the direction of each letter-key, but that impulse doesn’t transfer itself to my real hand unless something is triggering the movement. By trigger, I don’t mean a jerk or push. If you were to point at something, the trigger would be your intent. However the intention or motivation in my mind somehow gets lost in my body” (2013: 35). For her, touch, even a simple contact on the thigh, “is the conduit that gets some kind of impulse more organized” (2013: 35– 36). How to think of this contact, of this relation, in other terms than those of the worn dichotomy of independence/dependence or volition/nonvolition?
