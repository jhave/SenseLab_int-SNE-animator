In the chapters that follow, the artful is always colored by the edgings into perceptibility of autistic perception. I focus on autistic perception not only to honor neurodiversity, to take into account modes of existence I consider key to making our worlds richer, but to make a political case for the necessity of creating techniques and minor gestures that open existence to its perceptual more-than. This is not to deny that autistic perception, for all its perceptual wonders, also makes typical aspects of everyday life difficult to manage. For instance: crossing a street, it is always safer to have been capable of parsing cars from sidewalks from humans. After all, we live in a world that privileges forms of perception where the part can quickly and
easily be singled out from the whole. By foregrounding the inheritance of autistic perception in the artful, we are reminded that the qualitative openings in experience activated by autistic perception have a value in their own right. The problem is not with autistic perception but with how we constitute and value the frameworks of everyday living.
