In the multiplicity of the ensemble, the demand becomes an appeal, as Moten says, that opens the field to redefinition. “An appeal, in this delivery—you’re making all this sound, you’re making all this noise. You’re an ensemble, and that’s bound up with that notion of study and sociality that we’ve been talking about” (Moten and Harney 2013: 136). The strength of the demand is its capacity to create a transduction, a transmutation in the field. McPhee “was playing harmonics on the horn, so that the horn itself becomes something other than a single-line instrument; it becomes chordal, social. And that chordal playing shows up for us aurally as screams, as honks, as something that had been coded or denigrated as extramusical—as noise rather than signal. So, what I’m trying to do is to consider this notion of the demand as an appeal, as a claim, where you’re not appealing to the state but appealing to one another” (Moten and Harney 2013: 136). What matters is not just how the sound is being played and how it can be responded to by another player. What matters is the more-than, the way the horn “becomes something other than a single-line instrument,” the way “it becomes chordal, social.” The appeal in the event creates a speciation that shifts not only what the music can do, what the sound can do, but creates an emergent collectivity that cannot be reduced to the sum of its parts.
