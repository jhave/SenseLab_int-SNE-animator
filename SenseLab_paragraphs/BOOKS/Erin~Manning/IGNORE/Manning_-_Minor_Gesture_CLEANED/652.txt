The appeal is not without its violence, not without its consequences, but it does have the power to counter violence’s reactivity precisely because of its capacity to cut into the event to expose its multiplicity, to activate its emergent collectivity. As Moten writes, placing the question of the appeal in the context of blackness and black politics: “But, what we understand as the social zone of blackness and the undercommons is the zone precisely in which you make that claim—so that the demand is a doublevoiced thing, an enunciation in the interest of more than what it calls for. You are saying what you want, though what you want is more than what you say, at the same time that you are saying what you are while in the guise of what you are not” (Moten and Harney 2013: 138).
