Around the turn of the twentieth century, both Bergson and William James become invested in this problem of the act. What is it, they ask, that makes us so certain that the act is volitionally directed by a human subject? What is it that gives us the strong sense that the act’s effort belongs to us? And why is it so threatening, I might add, to think that within the act there is a considerable involuntary share of activity?
In chapter 6, I explore James’s account of the feeling of effort in detail. Here I will turn to Bergson’s analysis of the same question. The feeling of effort, Bergson suggests, seems to be allied to a muscular sensation: the magnitude associated with an effort is quantified according to the degree of muscular sensation a given activity demands. This suggests that the feeling of effort is allied to consciousness: what we name effort has something to do with a conscious estimation of intensity. Even when the effort is in vain—as in, for instance, picking up what we thought was a heavy box of books but was actually an empty box—the feeling of effort remains. Effort would therefore seem to be aptly connected to a willful movement undertaken, its intensive magnitude linked to the expectation of the amount of muscular contraction needed to follow through with the act.
