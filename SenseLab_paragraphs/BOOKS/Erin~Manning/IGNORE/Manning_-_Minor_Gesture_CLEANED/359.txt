The difference between a technique and a habit is a question of degree. Like habit and procedure, in the last chapter, or habit and rituality in the one before, they exist on a continuum as limit concepts. Whereas habit’s technique is backgrounded and often lingers on the edge of the nonconscious, technique’s habit is often consciously honed. Do you call the way your feet take you to the coffee machine in the morning a technique or a habit? I would say that with the early-morning coffee, or the walk to the toilet, these are more habitual because their techniques are so backgrounded. But if you’re dealing with an onset of Parkinson’s, the old habit may require new techniques. Now that you are less sure on your feet and your energy wavers from day to day, or even hour to hour, you will likely find yourself seeking out new techniques to hone the habit.
 Habit’s techniques will thus foreground themselves, and you might begin to think of your movements less in terms of habit and more in terms of technique. New techniques might include holding on to the piece of furniture on the way to the bathroom with your stronger left arm, or making sure there are no obstacles in the way that you might inadvertently trip over, or, in the case of making coffee, setting up the coffee machine where you can sit to prepare your morning coffee, or even changing your espresso-machine coffee habit to the simpler technique of making instant coffee. Techniques open habit to its potential undoing as much as they make apparent habit’s stubborn place in our life.
