Neurodiversity is the path I choose here to explore insurgent life. Encouraged by neurodiversity activism, I take neurodiversity as a platform for political change that fundamentally alters how life is defined, and valued. I do this with the neurodiversity movementâ€™s call in mind: to honor complex forms of interdependence and to create modes of encounter for that difference.14 One of the compelling tenets of the movement for neurodiversity is that it explicitly calls for social and medical services. Many classical autistics, for instance, cannot live without facilitation. They need assistance. And so they not only want to be seen as valuable in their difference, they also want their need for facilitation to be seen as a necessary and honored aspect of social life. The neurodiversity movement celebrates the relational force of facilitation broadly defined. This emphasis on relation is central to my discussion of facilitation in chapter 7.
