The words just can’t do it on their own: the feeling, the carrying feeling, is so excessive, the quality of its shaping too exuberant to be formulated. Hence the rhythm of autie-type, its force of the metaphorical, a mobility that dances before it signifies.
Depression in its alignment to anxiety petrified is not without vitality affect. Nor is it without movement. It is as uncontainable as the spark of its opposite. But its quality is different, and with this difference come different effects. For its shape is always closing in on itself. Direct perception of movement-moving is hampered. It’s like walking in molasses. If the shape of enthusiasm is the tremulous field of expression itself, its exuberance, depression is the field’s calcification at the limit where expressibility is closest to foundering, especially when called on to order itself into a linguistic articulation. There is simply nothing to say. But there is something to oink. Within the register of uneasy communication, the opportunity to body, to sound, to express in a collective voicing is nonetheless available, and it is this that Pelbart hears that afternoon at La Borde, and it is also this, I believe, that we often hear in the words that align to autistic perception. For the spectrum that precariously balances between petrification and spark is extraordinarily mobile in its tending to one or the other extreme, and perhaps especially so in autistic conversations where each word, each letter typed, is a reactivation that must relocate the otherwise dislocated, multiplying body.
