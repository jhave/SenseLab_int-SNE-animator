These alignments are not given. They must be crafted. Opening the way for a co-composition that potentially aligns itself to times in the making requires, I believe, a rethinking of the act of alignment itself. It requires what Guattari would call a group-subjectivity, an account of a collective that exceeds the personal. To connect with this collectivity in the making requires techniques for inventing modes of encounter not simply with the human but in the wider ecology of worlds in their unfolding. For the collective as a mode of existence in its own right is not the multiplication of individuals. It is the way the force of a becoming attunes to a transindividuation that is more-than. To become-collective is to align to a chaosmosis in a way that prolongs the capacity of one body to act.
