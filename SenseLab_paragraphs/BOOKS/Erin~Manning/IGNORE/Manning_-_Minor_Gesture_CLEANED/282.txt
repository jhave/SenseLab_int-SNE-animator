Speaking of modes of existence, Souriau writes: “It’s a matter of invention (like you ‘invent’ a treasure)” (2009: 142). There is no predetermined existence (just like the treasure only takes form “as treasure” when it is considered one). Since existence is only ever invented from within the field of relation and no two events activate the same field in the same way, modes of existence as Souriau defines them are by necessity interstitial. This interstitiality is what gives modes of existence their differential force and protects them from becoming restricted by habitual forms of life. At the same time, to “become a treasure,” a mode of existence needs a push toward a degree of consistency. The minor gesture is what gives the mode of existence the consistency it needs to become itself. How the minor gesture courses through and punctuates a mode of existence will define how the mode’s interstitial nature lands as event-time. A procedural fashioning is harnessed in the now of a potentializing architecture.
