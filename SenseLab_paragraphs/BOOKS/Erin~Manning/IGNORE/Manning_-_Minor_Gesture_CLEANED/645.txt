Affirmation is always more-than-human, always across registers vegetable and mineral, plant and animal. This is why, for Nietzsche, affirmation is not manifested in “man.” Affirmation does not belong to the human, it does not belong to a species. Affirmation cuts across the very idea of species. It conditions openings to the more-than, crafting experimental speciations. For Nietzsche, the figure of the more-than is the Overman. I would rather keep man out of it. What is important about what affirmation can do is that it does not idle in preexisting categories. The figure I seek does not have a predefined form. It is affirmation itself, affirmation as the force of a becoming.
