2 In Always More Than One, I speak about the force of relation that constitutes a bodying. I refer to speciations as the form the movement takes, in the bodying. A speciation might be thought of as the active ecology, more-than human, that accompanies a given activity. A writing speciation might involve a finger-chairsitting constellation, or a pecking-rocking-sounding constellation. Affirmation activates speciations by generating a push in the event that catalyzes a singular constellation that includes us, but is not delimited by any idea of a pregiven form. See the chapter entitled “Another Regard” in Manning 2013.

5 There also exist indigenous traditions in garment design that challenge the idea of the predefined shape of a body, inviting the body to define itself through an encounter with the fabric. These include the Indian sari, the Malay or Indonesian sarong, and the African kanga or kitenge, each of which is emergent as garment in the folding.

14 It is important to emphasize that not all collections are primarily designed by Rei Kawakubo, though she does supervise the process. Junya Watanabe has been an important designer for Comme des Garçons, first as a pattern-maker starting in 1984, and then as a designer in 1987. He started designing under his own name in 1992. Other designers include Tao Kurihara and Kei Ninomiya.
15 See, for instance, Derrida 1998, 1983.

18 There is a conceptual connection between the absolute fold or infinite line described above and Deleuze and Guattari’s “abstract line.” They define an abstract line as “a line that delimits nothing, that describes no contour, that no longer goes from one point to another but instead passes between points, that is always declining from the horizontal and the vertical and deviating from the diagonal, that is constantly changing direction, a mutant line of this kind that is without outside or inside, form or background, beginning or end and that is as alive as a continuous variation—such a line is truly an abstract line, and describes a smooth space. It is not inexpressive” (1987: 498).
