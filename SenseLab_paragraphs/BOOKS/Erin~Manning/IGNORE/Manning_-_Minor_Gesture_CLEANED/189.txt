Whitehead talks about this in terms of the creation of worlds—“feeling from a beyond which is determinate and pointing to a beyond which is to be determined” (1978: 163). To be determined here is resolutely to be in potentia—for how a feeling-tone vectorizes cannot be mapped in advance, and whether it lands in a way that activates a worlding cannot be predicted. But it can be modulated through the collaborative, participatory work of the minor gesture, and in the mix the artful can emerge.
