Idle No More is about the in-act. It is about rhythms of difference that open up experience to its minor gestures. Idle No More began in a movement, in a walk, and this walk has refused to stop, despite the fact that the government didn’t listen to the 270 Nishiyuu Walkers who arrived at Parliament Hill after trekking across Canada in the cold of winter.17 In the end Theresa Spence had to stop her hunger strike because her health was failing. The government still wasn’t listening.
