Whitehead’s account of reason does not deny definiteness or organization. Neither does it suggest that experience does not create categories of existence. The issue is how this happens. Hence Whitehead’s emphasis on function. Experience in Whitehead’s account, as in James’s, is not delimited from outside its own process: conditions must be invented, in the event, to make it operational. New modes of experience are created from the perspective of the event itself. This making-operational, from within the event, is what produces not only new modes of life, but livelier living. Reason is not the ability to judge from without, but the event’s own ability to parse “the welter of the process” (1929: 9). If we do not proceed against method, acknowledging the event’s own potential for activating the differential between the actual and the more-than, Whitehead warns that “varied freshness [will be] lost, and the species [will live] upon the blind appetitions of old usages” (1929: 19).
