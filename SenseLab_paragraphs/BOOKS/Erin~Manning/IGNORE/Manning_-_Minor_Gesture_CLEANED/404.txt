Lucy Blackman makes it clear that for her facilitation cannot be reduced to an active-passive relationship. Nor is facilitation strictly reduced to hands-on assistance. It does not simply mean to “create a path . . . for reaching certain objectives” (2013: 35). Quite the contrary. For Blackman facilitation is about developing a reciprocity in a field of experience that unlocks directed movement in a way that enables communication in and beyond language. “All I know is that some kind of touch or reciprocity makes me calmer, and the greater certainty of success in hitting the key that I visualize means that I can express the visual language which for so many years I had been cherishing” (2013: 35). Facilitation happens in the relation.
