My proposal is that an approach that begins in the field of relation is precisely political because it does not begin with the agency of a preconceived group or solitary identity. Rather than beginning with subject-based identity, this approach begins in the ecology of practices where there is still room for new modes of existence to be invented. New modes of existence call forth an articulation of the political that is not reducible to preexisting constituencies, and thus is open to creating and celebrating modes of lifeliving as yet uncharted.
