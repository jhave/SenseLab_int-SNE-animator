Idle No More affirms its debt. It knows the debt it’s owed. But it doesn’t seek credit. It knows credit would only silence it. In its affirmation, it activates the minor, and minor gestures abound. Some of them are immediately captured. There is often exhaustion, dismay. But there is also laughter, and play. “The transition is going to be hard, but from my perspective, from our perspective, having a rich community life and deriving happiness out of authentic relationships with the land and people around you is wonderful. I think where Idle No More did pick up on it is with the round dances and with the expression of the joy. ‘Let’s make this fun.’ It was women that brought that joy.”
