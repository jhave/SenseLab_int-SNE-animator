Reading of Kedar’s trauma as regards his experience of not being able to demonstrate his understanding of the world around him, it might be tempting to say, as Kedar himself does, that the rift between body and world, which translates to a body/mind dichotomy in his work, is really what is at stake. After all, it is a relief, as we read his book, to see him more and more capable of aligning his experience to that of neurotypicals— holding back his stims, writing, coordinating his body to his intentions— finally being taken seriously and considered intelligent by those around him.4 But is the body-world, body-mind distinction he articulates as needing to be overcome not a measure of neurotypical, able-bodied reasoning? What if instead we approached this question of how body and world co-compose from the perspective that “finding” the body in time and space is a learned experience? What if we followed Bergson’s account, outlined in the introduction, concerning the functioning of “continuous movement,” thereby questioning our presuppositions about what is voluntary? What if we suggested that the relational experience of bodying described by so many autistics—where body is a field of sensation more than a locus—is closer to the complex reality of experience’s formation than the neurotypical account we are fed from our earliest acquisition of motor skills?
