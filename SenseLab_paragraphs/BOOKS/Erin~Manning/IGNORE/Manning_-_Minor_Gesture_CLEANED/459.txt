What I am suggesting is that poetryâ€™s inherent capacity to facilitate the creating of bridges between autistic perception and language is multiplied, in autie-type, by a degree of facilitation that explicitly activates the relation necessary in making the transition from perception to words. This second degree of facilitation carries feeling across modes of expression. It facilitates the opening in language of affective tonality, making felt, in the words, what I have elsewhere called the prearticulation of language in the making, the beneath of words.
