In relation to the function of reason, Whitehead defines mentality as the “urge towards some vacuous definiteness,” a taking-into-account of what otherwise will likely remain unaccounted for (1929: 32). This is where appetition comes in: “This urge is appetition. It is emotional purpose: it is agency” (1929: 32). Appetition is the drive that propels the cut, the agencement that activates the ineffable within a process where, as James would say, everything is real, including the force of the more-than. With appetition comes, as the function of reason, an appetite for new forms of knowledge, new ways of coming-to-be. The appetite for more life, as Nietzsche might say.
