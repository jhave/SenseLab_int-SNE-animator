In the final pages of his account of the function of reason, Whitehead writes: “The quality of an act of experience is largely determined by the factor of the thinking which it contains” (1929: 80). Challenging the habit of situating facts above thinking—“the basis of all authority is the supremacy of fact over thought”—Whitehead inquires into the tendency to place thought outside experience, suggesting that this is precisely what is wrong with any concept of method (1929: 80). How might the fact of this occasion—what it does, how it feels, where it moves—be separated out by its thinking when thought itself “is a factor in the fact of experience” (1929: 80)?
Whitehead’s process philosophy is a critique of pure feeling that reinvents the function of reason. By definition, this will imply sidling thought and feeling, and locating thinking-feeling at the heart of all process. Indeed, every occasion of experience prehends the world through a process “of feeling the many data, so as to absorb them into the unity of one individual ‘satisfaction’” (1978: 65). Feeling here suggests an operation that moves incipient experience from the objectivity of data to the subjectivity of the actual occasion, data understood here not as packets of information but as the traces of past events which can be taken up or prehended to form a new occasion of experience. “Feelings,” Whitehead writes, “are variously specialized operations, effecting a transition into subjectivity” (1978: 65). The subjectivity feeling-thoughts effect is not that of a preexisting human subject, but the subjectivity of the occasion as such—its superject. Like Bergson’s intuition, which is the art in which the very conditions of experience are felt, feeling opens the event to the as-yet-unthought within thought itself.
