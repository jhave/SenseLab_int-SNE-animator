Cuts orient process. They dramatize it. When the dramatization is allied to the power of the false, a new contour emerges that undoes the cut of its hold on the what was. “A new status of narration follows from this: narration ceases to be truthful, that is, to claim to be true, and becomes fundamentally falsifying. This is not at all a case of ‘each has its own truth,’ a variability of content. It is a power of the false which replaces and supersedes the form of the true, because it poses the simultaneity of incompossible presents, or the coexistence of not-necessarily true pasts” (Deleuze 1989: 131). This qualitative shift in the way narrative understands itself tunes truth toward a rhythm of serial complexity that brings to the fore the “undecidable alternatives and differences between the true and the false, and thereby imposes a power of the false as adequate to time, in contrast to any form of the true which would control time” (1989: 132). The mutational rhythm this incites makes felt how the field moves, moved not only by what is known, but also, and even especially, by what cannot yet be known. The power of the false is an intercessor into the field of expression that makes it uneasy, that pushes it to its limit. It is not a lie—that would be too simple. It is the ineffable, the unknowable at the core of the what if as experimented in what else’s fabulations. “Beyond the true or the false, becoming as power of the false” (Deleuze 1989: 275).
