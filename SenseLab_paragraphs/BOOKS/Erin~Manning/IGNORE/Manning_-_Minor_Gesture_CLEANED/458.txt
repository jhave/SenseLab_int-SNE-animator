Poetry facilitates an opening onto the as-yet-unparsed. It moves with the as-yet-uninhibited, finding ways to bring to composition the forceof-form. In this way, it does exactly the opposite of chunking—it hinges back to the field, as Mukhopadhyay might say. Certainly, there is always a certain inhibition that happens in the selection that is language, but poetry remains more open to the rhythm, the tone, the color of autistic perception than do most other kinds of written language. If we see poetry, as Savarese argues through his concept of neurocosmopolitanism, as the “first facilitator” across the spectrum of neurodiversity, might autie-type be an example of the facilitation of facilitation? For the words come best, despite their arrival just this way, across communities and cultures, in their singular metaphorical, or, better, metamorphical complexity, with Mukhopadhyay’s mother always a few meters away, with DJ Savarese’s facilitator by his side, sometimes touching his wrist or sharing in the holding of a pencil, with Larry Bissonnette’s facilitator’s hand on his shoulder, with the touch that gives Lucy the sense of a body-dimensionality. The words come best in the relation.
