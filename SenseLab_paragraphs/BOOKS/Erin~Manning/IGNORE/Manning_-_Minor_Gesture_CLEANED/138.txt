Art, as a way of learning, acts as a bridge toward new processes, new pathways. To speak of a “way” is to dwell on the process itself, on its manner of becoming. It is to emphasize that art is before all else a quality, a difference in kind, an operative process that maps the way toward a certain attunement of world and expression.
Art as way is not yet about an object, about a form, or a content. It is still on its way. As such, it is deeply allied to Bergson’s definition of intuition as the art—the manner—in which the very conditions of experience are felt. Intuition both gets a process on its way and acts as the decisive turn within experience that activates a productive opening within time’s durational folds. Intuition crafts the operative problem.
