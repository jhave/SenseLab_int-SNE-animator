Gravity does not create the inflection. It is part of the conditions through which certain tendential inflections become more typical than others. For instance, gravitational movement tends to move toward the earth rather than away from it. But gravity does not always body the same way. What it can do is dependent on the ecology that is co-activated in the bodying. Gravity is a field, after all, not simply a directionality. The potential of the field cannot be understood apart from what it does, from what it can do, in relation to the fieldings it co-activates.
