It is worth repeating that a group-subject as Guattari defines it is not simply a group of individuals. The group-subject is defined by the group as it is formed in the encounter, not organized around the self-presentation of its members, but directed by the ways the group attunes to the necessity of its coming-into-formation. The group is never the sum of its parts, but rather an emergent collectivity which, for Guattari, always co-composes across the overlapping fields of the environment, the social, and the psychic. At La Borde, the focus on the group-subject serves to reorient the very question of mental illness, placing the burden not directly on the individual, but asking, as the movement for neurodiversity does, that difference be seen as a conduit for the crafting of transindividual modes of existence, modes of existence capable of integrating complex notions of interdependence and care. The goal is not to deny the needs of each person, but to recognize that it is impossible to abstract conditions of well-being from the relational field.
