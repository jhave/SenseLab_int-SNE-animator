Kawakubo does not work from a desk. She does not use fabric swatches. She does not sketch. She seeks no ultimate experience, no precise moment of revelation. As she says, “There is no eureka moment, there is no end to the search for something new.” Instead, she works, intuitively, problematically, to create conditions for the activating of connections heretofore unavailable to her. She constructs to make felt a relation that has not yet come to the fore. But she does not stop there. “Often in each collection, there are three or so seeds of things that come together accidentally to form what
appears to everyone else as a final product, but for me it is never ending.” Kawakubo continues, she persists in a serial manner, working in the interstices of what is on the way, in the art of time. “There is never a moment when I think, ‘This is working, this is clear.’ If for one second I think something is finished, the next thing would be impossible to do.”
