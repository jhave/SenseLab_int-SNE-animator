Out of movement is out of act. For Whitehead, all experience is in-act, variously commingling with the limits of the not-yet and the will-havebeen. Experience is (in) movement. Anything that stands still—an object, a form, a being—is an abstraction (in the most commonsense notion of the term) from experience. Such abstractions are not the image of the past (the past cannot be differentiated from the in-act of the future-presenting), but ahistorical cutouts from a durational field already on its way. Time cannot be held, and with its movement, everything changes in kind. “Object
and objective denote not only what is divided, but what, in dividing, does not change in kind” (Deleuze 1991: 41).
