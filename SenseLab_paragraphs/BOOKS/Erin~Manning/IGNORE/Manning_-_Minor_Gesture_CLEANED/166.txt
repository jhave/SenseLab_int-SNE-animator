Participation understood as immanent to the event raises a completely different set of expectations. Now, practice is considered immanent to the ecologies of an ever-shifting process. This radically alters the conditions of the work. Now, the problem is not how the participant can reanimate a process, but how the process itself as emergent practice can make felt its own participatory or transindividual nature. The practice shifts from seeing the object as endpoint to exploring how to prolong the art of time in the event such that new forms of collaboration can be engendered. Whether we are talking about the making of an artwork or the setting into place, through a process artfully in-act, of activist practices of emergent collectivity, what matters is less how the work defines itself than how it is capable of creating new conduits for expression and experimentation. Participation thus conceived is a putting into relation of an agencement, a mobilizing-toward, in the event, that doesnâ€™t begin and end with the human individual.
