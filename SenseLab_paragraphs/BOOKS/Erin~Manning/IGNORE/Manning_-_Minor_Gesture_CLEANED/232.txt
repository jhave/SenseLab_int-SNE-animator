Weather Patterns is a work in progress precisely because such events that are ecological at their core and resonant in excess of human participation are extremely difficult to actualize. The past five years have been a time of continuous experimentation in this regard. The first stage involved sewing conductive fabric into a third of the pieces of the Volumetrics collection and connecting the conductive fabric to wireless proximity sensors also sewn into the fabric. This was done to make the fabric responsive to its environment without needing to be directly handled. The idea was that
movement in the proximity of the conductive fabric would generate a data stream that could be transduced into sound, activating an emergent soundscape in conversation with the incipient mobility of the environment itself. With the collaboration of artists Nathaniel Stern, Bryan Cera, Mazi Javidiani, and Andrew Goodman, this allowed us to extend the notion of participation beyond human tactile exploration of the fabric to how field effects (air movements, electromagnetic current) might tune the environment. The performance of the work would be measured according to its capacity to field subtle changes generated by the work over time.
