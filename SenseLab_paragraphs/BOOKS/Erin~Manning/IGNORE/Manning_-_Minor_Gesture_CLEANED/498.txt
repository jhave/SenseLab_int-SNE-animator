Within depression, a similar sense of the untimely is at work. Steve Connor writes: “People with severe depression have a disrupted ‘biological clock’ that makes it seem as if they are living in a diff ent time zone to the rest of the healthy population living alongside them, a study has found.”7 Personal accounts support this research: “When I am depressed I feel like time goes slowly, yet at the same time I feel like I—or anyone else—has hardly any time to live at all. It feels as if time is running out.”8 “Yes, days go past slower and more boring feeling like everything’s going to drag on. On the other hand I can feel like life going too fast and the years are fl ing by and start gett g depressed thinking not long to live now etc.”9 “You cannot remember a time when you felt better, at least not clearly; and you certainly cannot imagine a future time when you will feel better. Being upset, even profoundly upset, is a temporal experience, while depression is atemporal” (Solomon 2001: 55).
