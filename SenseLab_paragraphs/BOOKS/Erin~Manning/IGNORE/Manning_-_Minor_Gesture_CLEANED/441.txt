Within neurotypical accounts of perception and attention, with the focus on volition, intentionality, and agency, comes a recurrent account of the sensory-motor. James explains: The ordinary “voluntary” act results in this way: First, some feeling produces a movement in a reflex, or as we say, accidental way. The movement excites a sensorial tract, causing a feeling which, whenever the sensorial tract functions again, revives as an idea. Now the sensorial and motor tracts, thus associated in their actions, remain associated forever afterwards, and as the motor originarily aroused the sensory, so the sensory may now arouse the motor (provided no outlying ideational tracts in connection with it prevent it from so doing). Voluntary acts are in fact nothing but acts whose motor centres are so constituted that they can be aroused by these sensorial centres, whose excitement was originally their effect. (1969: 189–190)
