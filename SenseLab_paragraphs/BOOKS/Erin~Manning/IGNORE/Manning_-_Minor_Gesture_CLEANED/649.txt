Violence must be done to it as thought, a power, the force of thinking, must throw it into a becoming-active‚Äù (Deleuze 2002: 108). Transmutation, transvaluation, these are potentially violent acts. Change is violent. Thought too cuts, it skews, it reorients. Reorientation is uneasy-making, and it has effects. But this violence heeds a different call than do grand gestures. This is not a violence that replays itself in the same register. It is a violence that opens the way for techniques that create new conditions, conditions propitious for new ways of crossing the threshold that open the event to the what else. The line is fine, of course. Violence turns quickly, and reactivity is always right there, ready to pounce. The potential for the event to sway toward destruction is always present, especially when the stakes are so high and the pain is so raw.
