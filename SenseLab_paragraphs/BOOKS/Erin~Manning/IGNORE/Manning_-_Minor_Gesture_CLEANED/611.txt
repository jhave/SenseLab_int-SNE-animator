Stereotype tunes quality to a becoming-reactive. We know in advance what the black body, the female body, the animal body can do. We attribute quality to form, and even as we tell ourselves that we are open to variation, the pull of the established relation between the quality and the measure directs our perception. What was is a powerful lure.
Becoming-active does not ignore inheritance. It sees it elsewhere—not in the it was, but in the planning of the not-yet. It creates value in the moving. It proceduralizes. It evaluates from the perspective of the event’s necessity, activated by the pulse of affirmation that opens the event to its qualitative difference. Affirmation is a qualitative valuation that alters the field. Because its will to power is active and not reactive, it never works against. Against would reorder the event into parts, staging one set of conditions for experience against the other. Affirmation does not stage—it fields. This fielding, as mentioned above, is before all else a tuning of affective tonality. This willing feeling, felt in the event, colors experience. There is no sense here of an external purview.
