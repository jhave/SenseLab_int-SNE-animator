EM: Yes, I think that there can be a tendency when we talk about the nonhuman to assume we are talking about the animal or the vegetal, which we are not necessarily doing at all. When you speak about the field, what you are taking into account is the more-than-human of the animal, the more-than-human of the oxygen, the more-than-human of the human. I call this speciation, as opposed to species. Relational fields rather than categories. Emergent constellations. A constellation meets a constellation rather than a particularity meeting a particularity. If you begin to think in terms of that kind of multiplicity, then immediately, I think, there is that sense of the care for the event, because the constellation is already eventful. As Whitehead would say, an event always carries with it concern for its eventness. Self-enjoyment of the event, in the event. This is punctual, of course. A constellation or speciation is emergent here and now, this or that way. Pragmatic, yet speculative.
