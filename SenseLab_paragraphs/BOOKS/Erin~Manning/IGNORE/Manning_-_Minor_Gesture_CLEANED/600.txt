The spiral, the eternal return, is how the event activates the being in becoming. This is why Nietzsche speaks of the eternal return in terms of selection. The eternal return is the parsing mechanism that gives time, that creates the time of the event. The eternal return gives rhythm to the in-act, tuning it not to a measure so much as to a cadence. For what returns is always more quality than quantity. What returns is not metric time, but the feeling of time, the feeling of power. When a selection happens that creates this or that occasion of experience, and when this selection is affirmed by the will to power, time spirals. Affirmation is a becoming-active precisely in its affirmation of time in its spiraling return. It is this tuning to time in its difference that preserves affirmation’s untimeliness. All of this “at once moment and cycle of time” (Deleuze 2002: 25). This is the eternal return: the double affirmation that at one and the same moment—in the cycle of time of its immanent invention—activates and contemplates the action. “Eternal return is the distinct return of the outward movement, the distinct contemplation of the action, but also the return of the outward movement itself and the return of the action” (Deleuze 2002: 25).
