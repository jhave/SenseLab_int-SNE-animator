I want to propose, as I have done throughout, that experience cannot be reduced to individual volition. It is collective—ecological—at its very core. The concept I want to foreground here for the selecting-out of experience is inflection. Inflection is a concept close to the idea of the differential as theorized by Leibniz and then Deleuze. In differential calculus, a point of inflection is defined as “a point on a curve at which the curvature or concavity changes sign from plus to minus or from minus to plus. The curve changes from being concave upwards (positive curvature) to concave downwards (negative curvature), or vice versa.”
