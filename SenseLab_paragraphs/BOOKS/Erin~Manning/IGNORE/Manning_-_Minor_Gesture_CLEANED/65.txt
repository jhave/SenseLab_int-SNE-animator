In the moving, in the act, we are in an immanent cause-effect relation. The soccer player’s active response to a change in play is an account of cause-effect, but one where cause-effect is still in transformation, affected by emergent improvisational movement operations. How the shift in play will affect the game is not strategized consciously by the moving soccer player; the cause-effect scenario is not measured in the doing. Something altogether different is at stake: the soccer player is in the field, is moved by the field; her movement not a response to the play so much as the activation of a new field of relation. The talent ascribed to the soccer player is ultimately due not to her volitional ability to move, but to her capacity to effect cause in the event, opening the field to its potential through intuitive realignings activated by mobile cues, leading to a (re)directing of the game. All movement works this way, as I argue in chapter 5. When we believe we have consciously affected the direction of an event, when we feel that an event has been moved by our volition alone, it is because a backgridding onto the event has taken place that has made sense of the play-by-play. This is usually how we explain our actions, but it is not how we act. How we act is based on a continuous interplay of conscious and nonconscious movement with nonconscious movement playing a vital part, especially as regards movement’s creative potential.
