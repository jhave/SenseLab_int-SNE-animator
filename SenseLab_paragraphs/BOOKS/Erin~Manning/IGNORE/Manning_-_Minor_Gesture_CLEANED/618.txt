Deleuze connects the will to power with the power of the false. “The other quality of the will to power is a power through which willing is adequate to the whole of life, a higher power of the false, a quality through which the whole of life and its particularity is affirmed and has become active” (2002: 185). It is through the power of the false that another kind of valuing is set into motion. “To affirm is still to evaluate, but to evaluate from the perspective of a will which enjoys its own difference in life instead of suffering the pains of the opposition to this life that it has itself inspired” (2002: 185). The power of the false does not offset responsibility—it reorients it toward the ability, in the not-yet, to respond from the perspective of the event’s own unfolding. “To affirm is not to take responsibility for, to take on the burden of what is, but to release, to set free what lives. To affirm is to unburden: not to load life with the weight of higher values, but to create new values which are those of life, which make life light and active. There is creation, properly speaking, only insofar as we make use of excess in order to invent new forms of life rather than separating life from what it can do” (2002: 185).
