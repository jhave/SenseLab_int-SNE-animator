In a procedural fashioning there can be no end to the process. This is a serial adventure with pinnacles of form that emerge along the way. The middle, the milieu of the in-act, is what is at stake. In this milieu, architectings of mobility produce tentative bodyings. Fabric shapes. But metamorphosis is what is most sought-after. Kawakubo designs in interstitial seriality, always toward that which “can and cannot be found.” “Boundaries for an architectural body can only be suggested, never determined” (Arakawa and Gins 2002: 68).
