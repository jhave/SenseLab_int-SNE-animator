Facilitation might for instance mean discovering together how to create what Blackman calls a “coactive sensation of touch,” how to create a certain contact, hands on or off, that might stabilize vision, how to invent a certain sense of presence that can trigger an activation that in turn can propel a thought into the actualization of words on a keyboard. However it unfolds, what is most important about facilitation is that it evolves in the emergent field of relation not only of autistic and facilitator, but of the wider ecology itself continuously transformed by this collaboration.
