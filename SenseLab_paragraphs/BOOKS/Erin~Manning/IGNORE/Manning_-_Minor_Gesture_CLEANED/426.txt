The field’s concern for its parsing cannot be separated out from what is experienced. The pull of the terminus moves the event, but is not the event. How the event comes to be, its subjective form, is how the knowerknown relations have resolved themselves for this singular occasion, coming together in just this way. The coming-into-itself of the event is therefore simply goal-oriented. The terminus is not the end as seen from a neutralized external perspective. The event, as I have emphasized before, is not pure process: it is actively disjunctive—a becoming of continuity, not a continuity of becoming. “In a world where both the terms and their distinctions are affairs of experience, conjunctions that are experienced must be at least as real as anything else. They will be ‘absolutely’ real conjunctions” ( James 1996: 60). How the conjunction or the disjunction operates is how the event has come to be. Importantly: without disjunction there would be no cut, no cleaving, no inflection, no minor gesture. No event would ever come to be. Terminus is the operative pull of this coming to be, not its predetermining result.
