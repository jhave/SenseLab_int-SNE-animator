Both-and is transvaluing. It is not either/or. It is qualitatively abstract, undefinable in advance, and absolutely what it is when it lands. “Becoming and being are a single affirmation” (Deleuze 2002: 189). This is an affirmative book. It accepts affirmation’s mantra: “The whole, yes, universal being, yes, but universal being ought to belong to a single becoming, the whole ought to belong to a single moment” (Deleuze 2002: 72). It builds with the single moment’s capacity to shift the register of the what else. It choreographs with the single moment of the untimeliness of the eternal return. And it recognizes in that single moment the multiplicity of the open whole. The it is what it is is nowhere present.
