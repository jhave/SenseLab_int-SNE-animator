Carrying is always tied to movement. As I outlined in the last chapter, to move as an autistic is to live in paradox. On the one hand, there is nothing but movement, most of it nonvoluntary, which, for neurotypically inflected existence, translates as strange, unpredictable, disturbing—the autistic body simply moves too much. On the other hand, it is this same overabundance of movement-moving that keeps the autistic singularly open to perception in its most complex iterations, making directly felt the world’s edgings into itself. “Sometimes I pity you for not being able to see the beauty of the world in the same way we do. Really, our vision of the world can be incredible, just incredible,” writes Naoki Higashida. “When you see an object, it seems that you see it as an entire thing first, and only afterward do its details follow on. But for people with autism, the details jump straight out at us first of all, and then only gradually, detail by detail, does the whole image sort of float up into focus” (2013: loc. 513).
