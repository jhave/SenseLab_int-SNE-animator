Whitehead talks about this as negative prehension. In the actual occasion, in the event of activity realizing itself as event, there is a taking-up of experience through prehension. Prehension is what culls this or that from the field of movement-moving. When the prehension actualizes as occasion, the world has appeared in its singularity and created this or that felt experience. But what of the almost-felt in its push-pull elasticity? Hasn’t this too made a difference, even if it wasn’t aligned to in the event?
The almost makes a difference. It is the more-than of experience in the making. This more-than is alive in the productive schism between the act and the in-act. It is what remains, but also what exceeds the event. Every event is made up of this surplus. This surplus is elastic. It has no form as such, it has no tense, it cannot be categorized.
