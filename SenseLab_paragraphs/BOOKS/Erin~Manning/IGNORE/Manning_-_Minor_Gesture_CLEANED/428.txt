If the autistic grabs the vase instead of the apple, it is too simple to say that her body didn’t go where her mind wanted to. What actually happened is that the apple, as terminus, despite being the motor of the event, was supplanted by the insistence of the light-ray, which monopolized the event in its in-forming to such a degree that it ended up becoming the conduit for the reaching-movement. This, as James might say, was what the event ended up “having in mind.” This is not to deny the frustration of the hungry autistic who now has a vase in her hand. It is to emphasize that the voluntary/involuntary dichotomy devalues the complexity of what has actually happened. Neurotypical experience is not so different. Its ends simply look different because what the event had in mind more often seems to cohere with where the movement was initially going. The challenge is to understand the agencement of terminus as an activity of the field itself, and to become aware of the backgridding necessary, even on the neurotypical end of the spectrum, to make the terminus conform in its generative pull to the subjective aim.
