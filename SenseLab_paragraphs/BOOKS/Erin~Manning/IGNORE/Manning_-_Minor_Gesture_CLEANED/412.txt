Say McDonalds were nowhere close by, and the impulse controlled itself enough to direct the field of attention toward the apple on the counter in the kitchen. Another challenge might still be in store. The apple might just not resolve itself clearly for perception, backgrounding itself instead in experience. The vase beside it, reflecting the sunlight, might stand out much more. In this case, the hunger agencement might be redirected toward a light-reflection agencement, thus leading the autistic’s movement toward the vase despite what they initially perceived as their actual interest in the apple. This might confuse the onlooker, who might then assume that the autistic wasn’t hungry, or, worse, that she couldn’t distinguish between vase and apple. If this is the case, other techniques will need to be invented that facilitate the right balance between depth perception, color, tactility, hunger, and movement. This facilitation is likely going to involve another person with whom the environment in its unfolding will be navigated in ways that will morph over time based on the needs of the relation.
