Shifting in and out of autistic perception, language comes in fits and starts, in a time all its own. Watching Chammi communicating in the film Wretches and Jabberers (dir. Geraldine Wurzburg, 2010), a film that follows two autistics, Tracy Threscher and Larry Bissonnette, in their travels to meet autistics in India, Japan, and Finland, we see a familiar scene: Chammi types, one letter at a time, while his mother facilitates not only by touching him but also, as is often necessary with facilitated communication, by vocally encouraging him to continue when he becomes anxious. One sentence is typed. And then Chammi pushes the chair away, runs into the next room, waves his fingers in front of his face, vocalizes. For someone unfamiliar with autism, it would seem he has completely lost interest in the conversation. But soon he returns to his chair, where, out of the frenzy of the movement, another sentence is typed. When asked about why he needs to move around like this, Chammi types: “Killingly hard to figure out, the pattern of movement I need to type my thoughts.”
