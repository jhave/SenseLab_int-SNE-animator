In his work on the alignment of depression and capital in neoliberal times, Bifo (Franco Berardi) uses the figure of Guattari—with whom he collaborated when he was also a committed activist—to explore the relationship between depression and the act. Focusing on Guattari’s “winter years,” Bifo wonders how depression affected Guattari’s work as a philosopher and activist. Bifo suggests that Guattari’s depression not only left him paralyzed in the face of life, but put him in a situation where he gave himself to causes that he didn’t really believe in. Depression, it seems, not only affected Guattari’s capacity to be in the act, it transformed his ability to direct his energies in ways that would best move his practice forward. This inability to demonstrate volition with respect to what was most important to him— activism, Bifo argues, is in part tied to Guattari’s own reluctance to discuss the relationship between activism and depression. Bifo explains: I sensed and was convinced that in the final decade of his life, Guattari had at several points undertaken a political commitment in which he did not deeply believe, that is, seeming to him to be his duty to “hold on,” that he needed to get past this rather difficult, regressive period, etc. And I perceived a kind of exhaustion in his will to maintain a position. So in this phase of the Guattarian itinerary, what seemed to me to be missing . . . is a reflection about depression. While one would need to enter more fully into this concept, depression basically is a disinvestment of libidinal energies in facing the future, in facing the world. Naturally it’s a question of a pathology, but not only that. Or rather, in short, the pathology is not something to be undervalued. (Berardi 2008: 158)
