Honing the interval is a technique that is capable of altering the flow of movement-moving. I call this choreographic thinking. Choreography at its best is not about aligning bodies to precomposed shapes. It is about generating modes of moving that make felt the complex ecology of incipient movement, to make felt what I have elsewhere called movement’s preacceleration and its elasticity of the almost.14 It is about composing techniques for experiencing the more-than of form. To choreograph the interval is to attend, in the event, to how movement’s force-form is elastic, to sense the shift activated by the inflection and to fashion ways of cueing and aligning that keep the field of activity alive to the virtual effects of total movement.
