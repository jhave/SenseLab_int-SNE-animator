I want to think this immanent editing of decision in a choreographic practice as the activator of an agencement that occurs in event-time. Eventtime is not linear, metric time. It is a making-felt of the interval, a makingapparent of how time tunes with the inflection of movement-moving. Event-time makes felt the rhythmic differential in the passage from minor gestures to technicity. Event-time cannot be abstracted from the eventâ€™s coming into itself. It is not a time framed, but a time without measure. Event-time, the art of time, is time in relation, time actively co-composing in an emergent ecology.
