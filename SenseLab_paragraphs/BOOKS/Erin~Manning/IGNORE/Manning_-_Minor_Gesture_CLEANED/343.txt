Consider this scenario: You feel the subway coming toward the platform before you see it, its sound and its vibrations preceding it. This movement tunes the whole platform, qualitatively altering the posture of those waiting. You may not yet see movement, but it is welling, its incipiency felt across the multitude. If this is rush hour at the Lionel Groulx station in Montreal, hundreds of people are poised. Some are stiller than others, waiting quietly for the subway doors to open, some are shifting impatiently between those standing in line, others are walking down the platform, their rhythms a mix of hurried and languid, some are talking on the phone, some are reading.
As the subway doors open, a subtle anticipatory shift in posture and tonality can be felt across the platform. Where before there seemed to be a relatively simple directionality, most of it tuned toward the subway doors, now a bidirectional tendency begins to form. These two movements can be quite frantic in their co-composition, especially when in addition people are running from the just-arrived train on the other side of the platform, hoping to make it onto the one you’ve been patiently waiting for. Yet very few collisions occur. And this is with many distractions—people listening to music with their earphones, friends talking, people running to get in before the doors slam. How do we all move together so seamlessly?
