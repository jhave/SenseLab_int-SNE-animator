Autistic perception, as I have described throughout, is a direct experience of relation, a worlding that makes felt the edging into itself of experience. This makes it difficult for autistics to have a strong sense, at any given moment, of a time separated out from the event-time of their perception. Metric time, time counted, is often difficult to get a sense of. Of course autistic perception of time varies as much as autistics themselves do, but there are some salient characteristics. For instance, those on the spectrum “experience a delay in how they process certain stimuli, including time. It can sometimes be hard for them to comprehend that hours have passed. For example, a person with autism who has echolalia may hear a phrase in the morning and repeat the phrase hours later out of context.”
