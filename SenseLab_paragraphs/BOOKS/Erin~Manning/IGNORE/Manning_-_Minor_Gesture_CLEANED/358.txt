Techniques are associated with both habit and skill. For those of us who have practices honed over time, such as playing an instrument, dancing, painting, we have a strong sense of what technique might be, usually associating it to repetitive gestures and, in the case of skill, with virtuosity. At the other end of the spectrum, where technique is more tied to habit, technique might be associated with ways of keeping house, ways of bringing up our children, ways of being in a relationship, ways of teaching. We also have techniques for walking in the snow, for interacting with strangers, for dealing with fear.
