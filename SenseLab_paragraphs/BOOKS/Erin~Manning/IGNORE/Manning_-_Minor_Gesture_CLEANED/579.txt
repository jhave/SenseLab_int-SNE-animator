Affirmation is always endangered by the reappropriation of the event by the forces that would make it reactive, that would undo it of its generative activity. It is very tempting to see ourselves at the center, directing experience. In fact, this reorienting gesture toward our own needs has become second nature in many if not most of our cultures: our education, our training has led us to believe that this is about us, about our feelings, about our identity, and that it is our judgment that matters most. We associate reason with objectivity, and objectivity with knowledge.
