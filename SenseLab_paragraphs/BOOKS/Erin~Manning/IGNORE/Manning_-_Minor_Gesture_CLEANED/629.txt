Despite its splash, the grand gesture of reconciliation in the end cannot open up experience to the force of its ineffability because it does not make way for a fabulation that could expose it to these activating deviations. Instead, it reduces the field to the either/or scenario of acceptance or denial, firmly positioning power stakes that continue unaltered. Experience is contained: “If I tell you I am sorry, then surely you must accept my apology, and now we can get on with things. If not, that’s your choice—I’ve done what I can.” But what of the thousands of fissures, complex and untimely, that make up our collective experience? What of the truths that have grown and mutated over the years of our collective experience? What if we began there, in the complexity, in the proliferation? How else could we proceed without reducing experience to its common denominator? How else could we consider healing without asking you, the victim, to reconcile yourself to our uneasy continued complicity? How else could we collectively invent modes of existence without reducing experience to that first wound that has already been worried enough? First Nations have been clear: self-determination is the recognition they require, on their terms, in their way. It is not for us to excavate their past. It is for them to create their future.
