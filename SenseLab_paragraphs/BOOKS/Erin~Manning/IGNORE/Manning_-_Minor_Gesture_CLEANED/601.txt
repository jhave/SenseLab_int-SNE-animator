The eternal return is a synthesis, but nothing like a dialectical one. It is, as Deleuze writes, “a synthesis of time and its dimensions, a synthesis of diversity and its reproduction, a synthesis of becoming and the being which is affirmed in becoming, a synthesis of double affirmation” (2002: 48). The eternal return is active in each moment. “Returning is everything but everything is affirmed in a single moment” (Deleuze 2002: 72).
