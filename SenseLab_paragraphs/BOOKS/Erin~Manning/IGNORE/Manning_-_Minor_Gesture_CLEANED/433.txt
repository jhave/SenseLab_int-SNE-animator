And yet there’s still the issue of the open fridge. “The end conceived . . . [will] always awaken its own proper motor idea.” That a movement will, in conscious reappraisal, be found to have aligned to what the event had in mind is what makes the movement seem subject-directed. This habitual reappraisal of how we’ve gotten somewhere (I don’t know how I got home—I must have walked one step after the other), or how we’ve brought the food to our mouths (I don’t remember eating, but yes, I must have moved my hand to my lips repeatedly), or how we’ve typed this chapter (I don’t remember seeing the keys in their singularity, but since the essay is in front of me, I must have fingered the right keys), is how we develop our sense of intention and volition. Because the frame of the movement for the most part fits our idea of where we needed to go, we align the two and are confident the movement emerged from our personal directives. And when this fails, for instance when we fall on the ice or miss our mouths with our water glass or type the wrong letter, we laugh and say we must have been distracted. But attention is more complex than this, and this is what we learn from autistic perception.
When you missed your lips with your water glass, you weren’t unattending. You were likely strongly in attendance, just not to the glass. There was a deviation, unrecognized in the moment, but with consequences for the future. At that moment of what you might like to call distraction, the region of the motor idea expanded, and with that expansion the precision you are accustomed to in your movements was jeopardized. Consider this event of attention fielding to be the common experience of many autistics. If “the end conceived awakens its own proper motor idea” and the motor idea is in the field of relation, it follows that the movement activated may not conform to expectation.
