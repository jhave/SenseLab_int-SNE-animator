A weather pattern is brought into experience through a minor gesture. When the artwork exceeds its status as an object, when the work becomes relational rather than simply interactive, when there really is a sense that what is at stake is more-than the sum of the artworkâ€™s parts, a minor gesture has been generated. This minor gesture, present in each of the fields of action the work emboldens, is not the work as such: it is how the work works. Here, where entertainment exceeds human-centered narratives of consumption so aligned with capitalism, something else is at stake: entertainment is distributed across the ecology of experience. The major language of matter-form, the object, the gallery itself, is tampered with, and what emerges is the force of a gesture that opens art to the artful.
