Active forgetting is the ultimate affirmation in Nietzsche. “A specific active force must be given the job of supporting consciousness and renewing its freshness, fluidity and mobile, agile chemistry at every moment. This active super-conscious faculty is the faculty of forgetting” (Deleuze 2002: 113). Forgetting, for Nietzsche is “a plastic, regenerative and curative force” (Nietzsche 2002 in Deleuze 2002: 106). To forget debt does not mean to forgive it. The forgiveness of debt is still in the logic of credit. Credit “is a means of privatization and debt a means of socialization. . . . Debt is mutual. Credit runs only one way” (Moten and Harney 2013: 61). Credit keeps us cagey. Debt must be forgotten in order to leave behind the very idea of credit, the very idea that what we owe can be privatized.
