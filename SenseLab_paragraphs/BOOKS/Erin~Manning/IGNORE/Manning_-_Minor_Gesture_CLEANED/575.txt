How to will something new? Nietzsche’s will to power is often misunderstood as the force of an individual will. This misunderstanding turns the will into the volitional act of a preexisting subject. The will to power is not that. It is what brings out the difference in the event. It is the force through which experience tunes and orients. Gilles Deleuze writes: “The question which Nietzsche constantly repeats, ‘what does a will want, what does this one or that one want?,’ must not be understood as the search for a goal, a motive or an object for this will. What a will wants is to affirm its difference. In its essential relation with the ‘other’ a will makes its difference an object of affirmation” (2002: 9). The will to power activates the field of relation by shifting its relations of power. This power is directed by the force of affirmation itself. What moves affirmation is not the subject. Affirmation is in the event, activated and motivated by a will to power that orients the event to its incipient tendency. The will to power is the push-pull within affirmation that forces the event to act. From this act, subjects and objects emerge, but they are never in advance of it. A philosophy of the event is never an ontology, never a story of being before becoming. A philosophy of the event is onto-genetic: it moves before it is.
