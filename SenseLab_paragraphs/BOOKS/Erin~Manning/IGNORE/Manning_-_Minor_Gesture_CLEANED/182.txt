Tweaked toward the artful in the process of making, art becomes a way toward a collective ethos. From the most apparently stable structure to the most mobile or ephemeral process, art that is artful activates the art of participation, making felt the transindividual force of an event-time that catapults the human into our difference. This difference, the more-than at our core, the nonhuman share that animates our every cell, becomes attentive to the relational field that opens the work to its intensive outside. This relational field must not be spatially understood. It is an intensive mattering, an absolute mobility that inhabits the work durationally. It is the art of time making itself felt.
