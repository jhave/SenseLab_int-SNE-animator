I suspect that cueing to movement in its co-composition is more intuitive across the spectrum of neurodiversity than cueing to movementposition. How counterintuitive, then, to approach autistic movement— or any movement instruction, for that matter—from the perspective that there is a definable frame as regards where movement begins and ends? Why, knowing about autistic movement disturbance, would we ask autistics to measure their capacity to move on the accomplishment of a prechoreographed task instead of investing in modes of cueing and aligning that celebrate incipient movement? Why, when for all of us a relational movement-moving is more intuitive than a staged movement-task, do we still tend to privilege the neurotypical account that movement begins with stopping (think of the typical dance class that begins every movement from stillness, as opposed to those fantastic choreographers who “find” the movement in the middle of its self-expression), that movement is organized through frames imposed from the outside (think of the typical way of teaching a danced movement sequence from the perspective of an 8-count that begins with 1 and ends with 8 as opposed to the more fluid rhythms of a volleyball game, where it is the movement of the ball that choreographs movements already moving)? Clearly both tendencies are well and alive— so why do we still persist in privileging so-called “volitional” movement?
