One technique I am using at the moment to try to make a bridge between practices is to allow projects to develop without necessarily deciding what form they will eventually take. This involves allowing the project to investigate its own ways of generating itself before deciding how it comes to expression. In the past months, this led me to work mostly in the studio, developing the conditions for a participatory textile work I am calling The Smell of Red, but lately it has moved me back to my desk to explore the concept of the minor gesture, a concept I am working to define in relation to what I think of as the “artful” within the participatory. This is rare for me—to find a passage between writing and art where the writing actually feeds the artmaking and vice versa.
In the end, though, each practice has to be able to do its own work: the philosophy and the art have to stand on their own. And so the rigor of each practice has to be honed, and this is of course difficult with the time constraints we all have. But the SenseLab functions as a good conduit, as does the teaching I do, which both involve close philosophical readings paired with work in the artist studio.
