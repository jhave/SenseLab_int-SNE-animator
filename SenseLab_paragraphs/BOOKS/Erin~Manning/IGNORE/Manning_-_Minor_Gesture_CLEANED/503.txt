Movement makes time, makes time felt. It activates the field in its emergence, making felt how spacetime composes with the time of the body, in the bodying, and, in this case, with the time of language. But let us not forget that the time of the body is doubled, petrification and spark, on a spectrum that is precarious at both ends. As I did elsewhere, Iâ€™d like to think of the time of the body in the moving as the shape of enthusiasm. Think the shape of enthusiasm not as a personalized body that is enthusiastic, but as the experience of bodying that shapes the event and is shaped by it.
The shape of enthusiasm is itself a spectrum that swings in an oscillation that moves from the potential energy or the energy-in-waiting of petrification, to the expressive, potentialized energy of the spark. The shape of enthusiasm gestures toward the more-than in the event at both ends of the spectrum, foregrounding how the in-act is operational both in its initial activation and in its coming-to-be as this or that. This is an enthusiasm, a chaosmosis, not with life already engendered, but in the very act of engendering. At the petrified limit, an enthusiasm held in abeyance, absolute movement, energized potential. At the exuberant limit, an enthusiasm fully expressive, in the moving.
