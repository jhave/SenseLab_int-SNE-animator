In a text on Guattari, Deleuze speaks of two Guattaris, a Pierre and a Félix (he was called Pierre-Félix). According to Deleuze, one was “like a catatonic head, a blind and hardened body perfused by death, when he takes off
his glasses,” the other “a dazzling spark, full of multiple lives as soon as he acts, laughs, thinks, attacks.” These are the two schizophrenic powers of an
anti-I: the petriﬁcation and the spark.
—Peter Pál Pelbart, “Un droit au silence” (my translation)
