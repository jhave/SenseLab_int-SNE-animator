1 The Occupy movement is a good example of this. There is no question, it seems to me, that Occupy has had long-lasting effects. It has affected our belief in mobilization and has resulted in sustained political work at the local scale. Montreal is a good example of this: not only did we see the largest student strike in Quebec history in 2012 (the Maple Spring), but the classroom has palpably changed since the end of the strike: students are much more vocal about their belief in free education and in their critique of neoliberalism. Almost three years later, demonstrations took over the streets once again in March and April 2015 in the hope of reenlivening debate around austerity measures and free education. While this student strike only lasted a few months, there is a sense that the unrest remains active under the surface. Forums for debate and political organizing abound, not only in the student sector, but among primary school teachers and other public sector unions.
