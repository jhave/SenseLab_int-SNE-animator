This is not to underestimate the pain, difficulty, even horror of depression, nor to underplay how complex misalignments make us feel our silence on the one hand, or our anxiety on the other as signs of our decalibration with the world. Nor is it to argue that drugs against depression in its widest definition should be handed out as liberally as they are. It is simply to inquire, across my own experience, and through the moving reading of Peter Pál Pelbart’s account of Guattari’s petrification, how else we can facilitate emergent collectivities without turning to the neurotypical habit of
pathologizing difference, or, in the case of depression, of too quickly aligning the nonvolitional to passivity.
