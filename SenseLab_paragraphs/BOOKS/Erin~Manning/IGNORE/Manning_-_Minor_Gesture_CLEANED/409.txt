In the reaching, something else happens as well. Perceptually, a parsing has occurred that singles out the apple from the counter and everything around it. This parsing, with the nonsensuous perception that accompanies it, also brings along a felt impression that the apple has a specific size, depth, weight. You see it as an object, and, in doing so, you unsee the environment with which it co-composes. This allows the reaching to be precise. You grab it, and the apple finds itself in your hand exactly as you had previously seen-felt it, or so it seems. This grabbing, which included a seeing-touch previous to the actual touching, was made possible by the hapticity in the visual perception, which provided, in advance of the actual touching, a sense of what the apple might feel like, a feeling that likely also is starting to include a preconscious tasting. Your mouth is already watering. This doubling of touch-vision mixed with the tripling of touch-tastevision, which includes a singular parsing for hunger-apple-reaching, allows you to grab the apple and bring it to your mouth. You take a bite of it, most likely unaware of the complex movement just executed.
