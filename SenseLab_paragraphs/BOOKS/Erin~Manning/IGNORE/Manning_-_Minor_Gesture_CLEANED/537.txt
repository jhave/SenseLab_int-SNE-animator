AB: So you suggest that bodies envelop a certain field which we and other bodies already share. This means that one cannot separate the question of what a body can do from the milieu in which it dwells in relation with others. During your workshop with Brian (Massumi) you presented a beautiful picture: What happens when there is light coming through a window and it affects you? Being in touch with the sun is more than being a subject contemplating an external object. One is becoming sunlike in this moment?
EM: Yes, that’s a beautiful way of putting it. As an artist, I have always been very interested in these kinds of threshold effects. Like that moment when you are sitting at a café and you have been in an intense conversation and suddenly you look up and you notice that it got dark, but you cannot say when the light changed. And yet, upon noticing the shift in light you immediately know that the changing conditions affected how the conversation progressed. Threshold effects make a difference, and yet they are rarely experienced as such.
