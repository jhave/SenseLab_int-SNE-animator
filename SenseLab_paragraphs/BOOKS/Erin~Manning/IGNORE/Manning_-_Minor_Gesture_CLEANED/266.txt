Body and environment are, for Kawakubo, complicit partners in the reorientation of what textile can do. They are her palette. But neither is predefined, and importantly, she does not pretend to know, from one process to another, where the details of their co-composition will lead her: each new process requires a new inquiry into the body-environment constellation. With this as the directive that drives her practice, Kawakubo invests in the field of relation, the orientation of her practice always transdisciplinary. In the ecology of practices, she requires that her process be invented each time anew through an emergent activation situated in the event of creation itself.
