If autistic perception is the direct perception of experience in-forming, it is also, as I suggested above, a direct perception of time, but not metric or measured time. It is the direct experience of the time of the event. Eventtime is experiential time, time felt rather than abstracted. It is the time of the oinking in Pelbartâ€™s story. It is the moment in its alignment to itself, to its enfolding. It is not time in the sense of a pastness that can be recorded on the present. It is the now felt in its entirety, in its untimely infinity. And so it passes too slowly, or it moves too fast, oscillating in a time always of its own uneasy making.
