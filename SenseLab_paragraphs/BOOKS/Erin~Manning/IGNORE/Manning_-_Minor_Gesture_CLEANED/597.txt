The will to power, the feeling of power, dramatizes the stakes of the event.
“What do you will?” Ariadne asks Dionysus. What a will wants—this is the latent content of the corresponding thing. We must not be deceived by the expression: what the will wants. What a will wants is not an object, an objective or an end. Ends and objects, even motives, are still symptoms. What a will wants, depending on its quality, is to affirm its difference or to deny what differs. Only qualities are ever willed: the heavy, the light. . . . What a will wants is always its own quality and the quality of the corresponding forces. (Deleuze 2002: 78)
