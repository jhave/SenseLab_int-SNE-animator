Opening with Kedar’s experience of his own type of neurodiversity, what I would like to do here is to take autistic motor disturbance as the starting point for a discussion of a body-world split I feel is endemic to the neurotypical account of experience. While it would be impossible to generalize across any group of people, and any autistic will reiterate that there are as many autistic experiences as there are autistics, I will take autistic perception as the starting point to this exploration. Autistic perception, as I underscored in several of the preceding chapters, is not meant to describe a group of autistics. It is, rather, a tendency in perception shared by all that privileges complexity of experience over category. Autistic Anne Corwin describes it as a slowness of chunking: the autistic’s entry into an environment begins not with a perception of objects (chairs, tables) or of subjects (people) but with an edging into form, a tending of light and shadow and color. While this does eventually lead to the taking-shape of the environment, to its parsing, autistics benefit from the direct perception of the active ecologies of experience in-forming. Corwin, as well as autistics Tito Mukhopadhyay, DJ Savarese, Amelia Baggs, Ido Kedar, and many others, describe a field perception that foregrounds the heterogeneity of a welling experience before it succumbs to the categorization of its parts. While, as with neurotypicals, the environment does eventually chunk, there is an important time-lapse between the direct perception of the emergent ecology and the actual taking-form of the objects and subjects in its midst. Neurotypicals will not tend to be aware of this direct perception of experience except in extreme circumstances—shock, drug use, exhaustion—or perhaps in mindfulness exercises such as meditation.
