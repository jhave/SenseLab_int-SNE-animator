William James’s essay “The Feeling of Effort” is very interesting in this regard. Beginning with an account of neurotypical experience, James explores the place of volition in movement. Here, he proposes a vocabulary for feeling that refuses to be led by a concept of subject-based agency, exploring instead, like Whitehead does, how the aim, active in the event, creates the conditions for the act in its unfolding. The concept James will later use to articulate this—terminus—is not yet part of this early piece, and yet its presence is everywhere felt. For this reason, it is useful to become familiar with the sway of the concept of terminus as it plays out in his later Essays in Radical Empiricism before turning to how volition is theorized in “The Feeling of Effort.”
