The memory of the future, the art of time—these are not quantifiable measures. These are speculative propositions, forces within the conceptual web of experience in the crafting that lurk on the edges of the thinkable. The art of time is the proposition art can make to a world in continual composition. It is also the proposition that opens art to its outside, to art as in-act, to practice as the crafting of emergent collectivities. Instead of immediately turning to form for its resolution, the art of time can ask how techniques of relation become a conduit for a relational movement that exceeds the very form-taking art so often strives toward. Instead of stalling at the object, art as manner can explore how the forces of the not-yet co-compose with the milieu of which they are an incipient mode. It can inquire into the collective force that emerges from this co-composition. It can develop techniques for intuiting how art becomes the basis for creating new manners, new modes of collaboration, human and nonhuman, material and immaterial. It can touch on the technicity of the more-than of art’s object-based propositions. It can ask how the collective iteration of a process in the making itself thinks, how it activates the limits of researchcreation. It can ask what compels it to think, to become. It can inquire into the forces that do violence to the act of making time, and it can create with the unsettling milieu of a time out of joint, intuiting its limits, limits that often have little to do with form. In so doing, it can create a time for thought “that would lead life to the limit of what it can do,” complicating the very concept of life by pushing life “beyond the limits that knowledge fixes for it” (Deleuze 1983: 101). Art as technique, as way.
