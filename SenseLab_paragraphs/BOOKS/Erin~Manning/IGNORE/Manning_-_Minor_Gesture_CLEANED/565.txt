Affirmation does not see negation as its other. It operates in a completely different logic. Affirmation creates the trajectory, and from there the potential of the what else emerges. Negation, on the other hand, travels a closed circle predictable in its choreography. Though there is movement, it goes only where it has gone before. Negationâ€™s act is ultimately empty: it tends only to what it knows it knows. Setting what is against what is, there is no desire for difference. There is no desire. This sterility keeps it safe. From its vantage point of the safety of the well-trodden path, negation observes: it does not engage except to deny, to close down, to set apart, to name the stakes, deintensifying the threshold of encounter, of difference. At its limit, it does not even give in to this gesture. It simply closes the door. Because of its reactivity, negation is stifled in its capacity for creativity.
