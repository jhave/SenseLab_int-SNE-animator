In the most troubled years of fc, when facilitators were accused of writing in the autistics’ stead, the focus tended to be restricted to method.26 Recall how Blackman, writing about her path to eventually composing on the keyboard without hands-on facilitation, expresses with frustration that over the years people seem to have been more interested in how she typed than in what she typed. She writes: “Most of the next fifteen years [from the onset of typing with facilitation] were really a continual path to typing with minimal physical contact, not because I personally thought it important but because it was essential if I was to establish my own achievement in the eyes of others” (2013: 106). Whitehead’s words ring loud: “Some of the major disasters of mankind have been produced by the narrowness of men with a good methodology” (1929: 12). Method is anathema to autistic perception. It is also allergic to relation, for it relies on the ability to stand outside the event and judge it from without. No method will ever embrace the facilitation of facilitation. The agencements of attention in its fielding, the contributions of minor gestures, the metamorphical playfulness of poetic writing: these will be resisted by method’s desire to orient experience according to the false problems of questions already posed. Against method! screams autie-type, and we should heed this call.
