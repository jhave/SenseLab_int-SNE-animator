Duration is lived only at its edges, in its commingling with actual experience. In the time of the event, what is known is not outside the event: it is the mobility of experience itself, experience in the making. To actually measure the time of the event, a backgridding activity is necessary. Such a reconstruction “after the fact” tends to deplete the event-time of its middling, deactivating the relational movement that was precisely event-time’s force. Backgridded, experience is reconceived in its poorest state: out of movement.
