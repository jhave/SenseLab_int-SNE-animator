In Arakawa and Gins’s writings, as in Kawakubo’s, there is sometimes the sense that the human body rears up as the starting point rather than one of many potential fields of activation within the relational milieu. Yet a closer look at the workings of their work (including their writing, in the case of Arakawa and Gins) makes it amply apparent that it is the event of the work’s workings that matters. In their faire oeuvre, in terms of what they can do, both Arakawa and Gins’s architectings and Kawakubo’s fashionings challenge the view that the human subject is at the stable center of experience and that the body can be abstracted out from the complexity of the milieu. Arakawa and Gins write: “We do not mean to suggest that architecture exists only for the one who beholds or inhabits it, but rather that the body-in-action and the architectural surround should not be defined apart from each other, or apart from bioscleave. Architectural works can direct the body’s tentative constructing toward a holding in place, its forming in place. But it is also the case that how the body moves determines what turns out to hold together as architecture for it” (2002: 50). The tentativeness is of the body as mobile concept. A body is not a definitive form, but a tentative construction toward a holding in place. The tentativeness of all bodyings must be attended to in the creation of procedural architectures, for this is what keeps the event open to speciating potential.
