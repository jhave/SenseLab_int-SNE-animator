This is what David Lapoujade means when he writes that “at the heart of the human there is nothing human” (2010: 62). The world is made of relation activated by intuition, felt sympathetically on the edges of experience. Here, at the edges, the more-than, the more-than-human tendencies for experience in the making, are lively. “We must move beyond the limits of human experience, sometimes inferior, sometimes superior, to attain the pure material plane, the vital, social, personal, spiritual planes across which the human is composed” (2010: 62). What is at stake in the intuiting of the more-than that art requires in order to activate a minor gesture is not the requalification of subject and object, artist and work, but the shedding of all that preexists the occasion in which the event takes place. Only this, Lapoujade suggests, makes the unrealizable realizable.
