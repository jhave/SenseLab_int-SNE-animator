For Blackman the world is always encountered anew, in the midst, and its infinite mobility just doesn’t seem to facilitate the kinds of movement arrangements that would allow her to pass as neurotypical. It’s not that there isn’t also in autism the capacity for a conscious accounting of experience after the fact. It’s just that, even post facto, triangulation doesn’t compute. There is no stable surface, no stable ground, no fixed structure, with which she could easily triangulate. When the body-world continuum is not ruptured, an account of where one begins and the other ends simply doesn’t make sense. If everything is in motion, if everything is process, feet and ground co-composing, skin and air, vision and wind, sound and depth, how to select one body, one experience, one object?
