The sensory-motor is only a small aspect of how perception, attention, and movement work together. A movement felt is a movement-moving. The movement does not flow in a cause-effect scenario that begins with a push from outside itself. Rather, the movement is felt from the middling of its incipient directionality. It is felt because of how it lands, and how it lands is what constitutes its subjective form. Movement does not operate in any absolutely directive sense. It is not linear: it is more recursive— what the feeling has felt, what becomes this led and followed movement in the tango example, is how movement-moving has moved into its relational aim, spurred by a terminus that is less its goal than its activator. A movement learns from what it has done, of course—this is where technique comes in—but it is never limited to that learning. Virtuality courses everywhere in movement-moving, its preaccelerations affecting how attention fields and perception settles. Movement therefore cannot be considered as limited to the circuit of the sensory-motor. Movement is by its very nature generative of difference.
