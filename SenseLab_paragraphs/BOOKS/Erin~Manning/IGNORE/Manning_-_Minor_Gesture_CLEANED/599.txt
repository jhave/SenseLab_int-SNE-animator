A culture of affirmation is always spiraling, always reconnecting to a return that does not seek resemblance. When Nietzsche calls it the eternal return of the same, he does not mean the self-same. What returns is not the it is, but the what else. For the what else to return, a motor must make the event operational. This motor is necessity, as affirmed of chance. “Necessity is affirmed of chance in exactly the sense that being is affirmed of becoming and unity is affirmed of multiplicity” (Deleuze 2002: 26). Necessity funnels experience toward the points of inflection (the minor gestures) that tune the event, giving it its color, its tone, its shape. Affirmation creates the conditions for necessity and the will to power mobilizes necessity through the yes! of joy, activating the quality in the event. The eternal return then makes time for the event’s unfolding, just this way.
