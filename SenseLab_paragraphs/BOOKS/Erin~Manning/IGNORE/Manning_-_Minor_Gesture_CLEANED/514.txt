Autistic perception, as I have suggested before, emphasizes a modality of perception shared by all, but felt directly by so-called neurotypicals only under certain conditions. Depression is one of those conditions. Exuberance is another. In these conditions, what is felt is the precarious edge of existence where experience is under transformation, where the field of expression still resonates with its own becoming. Falling in love is an example of an event where the shape of enthusiasm overtakes what is thought of as the boundedness of the subject to foreground the opening the field of relation provokes. The deep silence of depression, where the world seems to be infolding, or the inner anguish of anxiety, where speeds and slownesses seem to be out of sync with the world at large: these are also events where the relational field vibrates and the sense of a preconstituted self falls away. This state of vibratory composition, where self and other are not yet, and where the categorical does not take precedence, is very much what Deleuze and Guattari describe as the eventful field of potential. This field of potential is not embodied by the personalized schizophrenic. As they repeat throughout Anti-Oedipus, their interest is not in this or that schizophrenic—“someone asked us if we had ever seen a schizophrenic, no, no, we have never seen one”—but of a schizoid pole in the social field. Over and over, they emphasize that schizoanalysis is not about the production of a schizophrenic, but about the schizophrenic process (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 380). Of course, Guattari worked daily with schizophrenics, but not with “the” schizophrenic, not with schizophrenia as a general idea. Indeed, all of the therapeutic techniques at La Borde emphasized the singularity of a given therapeutic event: there was no generalized therapeutic matrix.
