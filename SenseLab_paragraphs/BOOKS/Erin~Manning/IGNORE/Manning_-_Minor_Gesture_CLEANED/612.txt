Quality-as-difference is allied, in Nietzsche, with transmutation. Transmutation is the process through which the field values difference. Like transduction, it involves a singularization of the field that reorients it. Transmutation, also called transvaluation, involves “a change of quality in the will to power” (Deleuze 2002: 175). This technique, in the event, is what allows the stakes of the event to express themselves. This creates new values, values that exceed use-value, values that have not yet invented their use. They don’t yet know what they owe. “Values and their value no longer derive from the negative, but from affirmation as such. In place of a depreciated life we have life which is affirmed—and the expression ‘in place of ’ is still incorrect. It is the place itself which changes, there is no longer any place for another world. The element of values changes place and nature, the value of values changes its principle and the whole of evaluation changes character” (Deleuze 2002: 175).
Affirmation can no more be “in place of” than it can be quantified. Always without credit, it never knows where it will land, or what its debt will be. Once affirmation takes over, what is left is not reactivity, but risk— the risk of the not-yet, of not knowing, of not even knowing how to know. Study is all we have—the curious exploration of what the in-act can do. This is activist philosophy.
