Whitehead’s notion of vectors is useful in conveying a stronger sense of the more-than-human quality of experience artfulness holds. The vector, in Whitehead’s work, is defined as a force of movement that travels from one occasion of experience to another or within a single occasion. What is particular to Whitehead’s definition is the way he connects the vector to feeling. “Feelings are ‘vectors’; for they feel what is there and transform it into what is here” (1978: 87). It bears repeating that for Whitehead, feelings are not associated with a preexisting subject. They are the force of the event as it expresses itself. Understood as vectors, feelings have the force of a momentum, an intuition for direction.
