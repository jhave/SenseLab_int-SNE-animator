The walk of Idle No More is still creating pockets of undercommons. The point is not to be “faithful” to one particular iteration of Idle No More, but to create with it, to invent how else we can walk, how else we can idle no more. Speculating on the future of Idle No More in March 2013, Leanne Simpson writes: It’s difficult to say where the movement will go because it is so beautifully diverse. I see perhaps a second phase that is going to be on the land. It’s going to be local and it’s going to be people standing up and opposing these large-scale industrial development projects that threaten our existence as Indigenous peoples—in the Ring of Fire [a region in northern Ontario], tar sands, fracking, mining, deforestation. . . . But where they might have done that through policy or through the Environmental Assessment Act or through legal means in the past, now it may be through direct action. Time will tell.
