Facilitated Communication opens up experience, accommodating the agencements of the field in its co-composition. And yet because agency and volition are so prized in the neurotypical worldview, it continues to be seen as a counter to “really” individual expression. Many autistics therefore find themselves having to fiercely guard their so-called “independence” from facilitation, not because they don’t honor the relation, but because with it they are not perceived to be so-called independent thinkers. Speaking of the relentless focus on the question of independence, Blackman writes: “I find it really difficult to understand why other people are more interested in the process of what I produce than the content. I have sometimes felt that being a demo is not the point of my being a student, and really that this kind of discussion is more about wanting to be ‘normal’ (which I don’t) than about what I am achieving in terms of pure intellectual thought” (2013: 80).
