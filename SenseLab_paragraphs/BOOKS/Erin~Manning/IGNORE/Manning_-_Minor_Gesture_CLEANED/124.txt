What the conjunction between research and creation does is make apparent how modes of knowledge are always at cross-currents with one another, actively reorienting themselves in transversal operations of difference, emphasizing the deflection at the heart of each conjunction. The conjunction is never neutral: it works the work, actively adjusting the immanent coupling of research and creation, asking how the thinking in the act can be articulated, and what kind of analogous experience it can be coupled with, asking how a making is a thinking in its own right, asking what else that thinking can do.
The analogous experience that perhaps most strongly connects to the way in which making and thinking compose in research-creation is philosophy’s crafting of concepts. Philosophy is here understood not as a discipline but as a force of appetition, as a “hypothetical sympathy” in the intuitive making. Philosophy understood as a practice at crosscurrents with other practices. Philosophy as study.
