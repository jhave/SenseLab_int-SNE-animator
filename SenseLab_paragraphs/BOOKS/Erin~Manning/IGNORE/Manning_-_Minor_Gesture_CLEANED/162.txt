Gilbert Simondon speaks of the individual as the point of inflection of a process of individuation. For Simondon, the individual is emergent, not preconstituted. In Simondon’s vocabulary, there is an intrinsic relationship between individuation (the process), the preindividual (the force of form), and the individual (the turning point that opens the process toward new individuations). The individual (the singularity of a process) is never the starting point—it is what emerges from the middling of individuation. The individual is how the event expresses itself, never what sets it in motion.
