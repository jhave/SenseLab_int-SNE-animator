The question of interand transdisciplinarity has recently opened up in academic circles to what we in Canada call “research-creation.” Researchcreation, also called “art-based research,” was adopted into academic language through the very question of methodology. Starting out as a funding category that would enable artists teaching in universities who didn’t have PhDs to apply for large academic grants, the apparition of researchcreation as a category was more instrumental than inventive. For weren’t artists already involved in research? Wasn’t art practice always engaged in forms of inquiry? Wasn’t it a mode of knowledge in its own right? The issue was not, it seems to me, one of simply acknowledging that artists were also researchers, but an institutional tweaking of that already-existent research category into modes of knowledge more easily recognized by the academic institution. To be an artist-researcher would now mean to be able to organize the delineations between art practice and research methodology for the purposes of a grant that would then, inasmuch as grants ordinarily function this way, orient the research toward “academic” aims.
