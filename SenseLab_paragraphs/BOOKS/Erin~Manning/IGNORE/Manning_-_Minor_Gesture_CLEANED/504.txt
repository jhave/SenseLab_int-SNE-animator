Chammiâ€™s frenetic movement between sentences foregrounds a bodying that takes the shape of enthusiasm, a bodying here attuned to and in excess of, the articulation of words. This is shaping that defies description, at once anguished and exuberant, frenzied and ineffable. Movement here is itself expressibility, not a deviation from language, but its extension, in co-composition.
