Weather patterns are serial processes. Their beginnings and ends are difficult to ascertain. They are less directional than ecological. Their effects are distributed. None of these qualities make them ideal for the scene of contemporary art, a scene too often constrained by the bounds of what is already recognizable, what is already imaginable.10 Like the academic institution, the scene of contemporary art has much experience in generating false problems and in posing badly stated questions. Weather patterns, like the minor gestures that inform them, invent both modes of thought and modes of perception. In this sense, they are what Deleuze and Guattari call “collective assemblages of enunciation” (1986: 18). They are field expressions that intensify experience without reducing it to a single point in time or space. They are not metaphors but metamorphoses, active transducers of the everyday in the everyday.
