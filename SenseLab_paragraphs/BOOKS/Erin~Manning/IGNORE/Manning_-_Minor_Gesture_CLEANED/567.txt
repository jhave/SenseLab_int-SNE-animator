Ressentiment creeps up on you. What seemed active soon leads you to the same old, tired values. The worn paths become the only ones in sight, and what seemed like a taking-of-position now looks more like a dead end. Negation is, in the end, predictable, and this predictability tends to close in on itself. Resentment builds, and with it a loss of intensity, a kind of apathetic anxiety that keeps us in our place. “It is as it is,” we sigh. It would be a waste of energy to want it to be otherwise.
Is it? Is this path, this architecture, this choreography, truly “as it is”? Hasn’t even this worn path changed since yesterday? Can’t you see the brush of new growth? The problem with ressentiment is that it drags its feet in the same ruts day after day. It doesn’t want to feel the new growth.
