About the difficulty of initiating movement, Kedar writes: “I have been thinking a lot about my nonresponsiveness. It’s almost like a form of paralysis [yet] I’m not paralyzed to wave ribbons, or to pace, or things like that. Then I’m the opposite of paralyzed. I can’t get my body to stop moving around, though I want it to” (2012: 101). Autistic Naoki Higashida concurs: “When I’m jumping, I can feel my body parts really well . . .—my bounding legs and my clapping hands—and that makes me feel so, so good. . . . So by jumping up and down, it’s as if I’m shaking loose the ropes that are tying up my body” (2013: location [hereafter “loc.”] 435). Cueing to movement-moving is clearly not the challenge: it’s starting from stilled movement that is so difficult.
