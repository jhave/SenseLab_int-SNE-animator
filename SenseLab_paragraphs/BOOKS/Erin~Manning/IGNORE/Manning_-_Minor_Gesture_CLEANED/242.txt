When a technological process is used to activate a weather pattern, as in the most recent iterations of the work entitled Weather Patterns, what is necessary, it seems to me, is a sense of how the technological itself can operate as a minor gesture. How can technology activate a field effect without making the field effect about the technology itself? How can technology be used to make mobile the sense of time in the event, the time of the event? How can technology be mobilized to open the event to both its individuation and its transduction? How can technology activate something akin to the aura of the ritual event in the artistic setting, an aura capable of opening the event to its involuntary memory. For, as Michael Taussig writes, “it is involuntary memory which composes, no less than it is composed by, correspondences, and provides the home for aura” (1995: 381). How can technology get beyond “mechanical reproduction” to activate the artful that is process-in-variation?
