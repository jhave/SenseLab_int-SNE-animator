Thought taken beyond reflective consciousness reminds us that conscious thought is but the pinnacle of an experience that, in order to become conscious, has divested itself of much of its potential. As Nietzsche writes: “The logic of our conscious thinking is only a crude and facilitated form of the thinking needed by our organism, indeed by the particular organs of our organism. For example, a thinking-at-the-same-time is needed of which we have hardly an inkling” (2003: 8). A thought that has little inkling of itself is a thought in the act, a thinking in the making of an occasion of experience. It is an incipient activity that summons intensities toward a coming-to-expression, a thinking directly imbued with rhythm, with feeling. Marking a difference between recognizing and knowing— erkennen and kennen—Nietzsche plays with the strange untimeliness of thought in-forming, reminding us that with nonconscious thinking-feeling there is often a sense of recognition despite a lack of knowing in the strong sense (2003: 14). Knowing is incipient to the experience at hand, actively felt but often indecipherable in linguistic terms, alive only in its rhythms, in its hesitations, in its stuttering.
And all of this, to return to my mantra, not in the preexisting subject. “I don’t concede,” Nietzsche writes, “that the I is what thinks. I take the I itself to be a construction of thinking, of the same rank as ‘matter,’ ‘thing,’ ‘substance,’ ‘individual,’ ‘purpose,’ ‘number’: in other words to be only a regulative fiction with the help of which a kind of constancy and thus ‘knowability’ is inserted into, invented into, a world of becoming” (2003: 20–21). “I” is the movement of thought destabilized by the act, the coming-into-itself of a capacity to regulate experience, but only until it is destabilized again by the minor gestures coursing through the event.
