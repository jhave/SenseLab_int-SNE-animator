The place of refuge feels more livable when we remember that no movement, no fugitive public, is held by individuals. It is held by a multiplicity larger than anyone alone, larger than identity. It is held by that round dance in the shopping center that became the image of Idle No More, by a collective gesture infinitely more complex than any individual gesture could be.20 This is what returns: the multiplicity, the ineffability of an exhaustion, of a tragic joy that teaches us new ways of moving, new rhythms for bare activity. For the in-act, like affirmation, is not just about forward movement. In the undercommons, the place we cannot know, movement is before all else qualityâ€”it is the affective tonality of a shift in cadence, a barely perceptible sounding that propels a thought, a lulling that makes us dream and gives us the courage to dance. This is affirmation, a gift without limit.
