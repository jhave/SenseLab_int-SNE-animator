In neurotypically inflected experience, affective tonality is felt in the minor gestures of the environmentâ€™s tuning to expression. When affective tonality is most powerful, it becomes difficult to parse experience into words. But a lot of the time, this is not a major issue. Because of the inherent capacity for inhibition, if necessary the affective tonality can be backgrounded, its minor gestures ignored. In autistic perception, however, affective tonality is dominant, active in every aspect of how perception fields. This means that the act of backgrounding necessary to parse words from feelings is more difficult. It also means that the autistic is more aware of the struggle inherent in the task of making intelligible that which is so alive, teeming with the forces of affect. This is where the facilitation of facilitation can make a difference. In the facilitator-autistic relation, the facilitator stands in to modulate the environment so that the affective tonality can co-compose in ways that in turn will facilitate the parsing of experience into language. With this agencement the autistic is capable of fielding the environment in a way that attention can momentarily settle. This happens in the relation, which is why Blackman emphasizes that facilitation is much more than simply physically assisting with a task.
