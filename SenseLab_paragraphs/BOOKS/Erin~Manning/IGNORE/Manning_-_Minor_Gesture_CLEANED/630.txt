I am not saying the apology is worthless. It was high time for it. I am just saying that the politics of reconciliation are mired in reactivity. This has become starkly apparent in the Canadian context. How else to understand the Harper government’s studied disinterest in the continued disappearance and murder of Indigenous women? Over the past thirty years more than twelve hundred Indigenous women have gone missing in Canada. Indigenous women are three times more likely to experience violence than non-Indigenous women. The Harper government’s response: it’s not a systemic racial issue, but simply a criminal one. The grand gesture has been done, he seems to be saying—isn’t that enough?8
I am wary of the grand gesture, wary of how it seeks to choreograph the field, wary of how it cements the narrative of the it is in its alignment with the what was. What the grand gesture does, it seems to me, is further solidify the becoming-reactive on both ends. The victim, who has been haunted by the what was, must now be content, forever more, with the it is. “Get on with it!” reconciliation announces. “We’ve paid our debt! You are again in our debt, the cycle of credit healthy once more.”
