What Blackman calls “carrying the feeling” is all about the movement of a subjectivity very much in flux. Feeling here, as in Whitehead, is not to be understood as an external response to an existing event. Feeling is what defines the quality of the event in the event. There is no external subjectivity here: the subject, as in Whitehead, is not the activator of the act but what emerges in the act. Whitehead calls this emergent individual “the subjective form” of the event. How the event coalesces into itself is its subjective form. This subjective form, the subject of the event, the event’s speciation, does not necessarily resemble a human subject. The subjective form is how the assemblage of the event’s composition comes into itself. “There are many species of subjective forms, such as emotions, valuations, purposes, adversions, aversions, consciousness, etc.” (Whitehead 1978: 24). These subjective forms are oriented by what Whitehead calls the event’s “subjective aim.” The subjective aim, the event’s minor gesture, orients the event toward its actualization. Whitehead calls the process toward actualization concrescence, emphasizing the sense of a growing in the event (1978: 25).
