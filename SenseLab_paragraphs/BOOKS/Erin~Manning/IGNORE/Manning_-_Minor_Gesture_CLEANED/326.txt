If the body is a dynamic constellation in co-composition with the environment, if it is an ecology of practices, and if thought is an active contributor to the feltness of experience, it seems to me that the starting point in challenging the body-world split is putting thought in the world. Thought as Kedar experiences it is not “in” his body. It is across experience, in the synesthetic sensations that refute the absolute locatedness of body and world. That he has such difficulty aligning body to conscious will does not mean that the activity is not full of thought, nor does it mean that he is not in awareness. It likely means quite the opposite—that the thought is so full, so complexly aligned across a relational field that includes body and world in their co-composition that the thought’s subtraction into one conscious task (“point at that”) is extremely difficult.
