Insurgent Black life is neurodiverse through and through. This is its threat, that it cannot be properly regulated, that it exceeds the bounds of the known, that it moves too much—“I don’t need to disavow the notion that black people have rhythm.”12 Blackness, life-living, is life at the limit.13 Moten continues: “Antiblackness is antilife. Somewhere along the line black flesh held the responsibility of protecting generativity. . . . Life is Black life. . . . When you say Black life matters, you are saying life matters, and when you say life matters, you are saying Black life matters.” That neurotypicality as founding identity politics discounts black life implies, at the limit, that it discounts all life, all generative force, all unbounded, unpredictable, rhythmic, insurgent life.
