When incipiency tunes toward new modes of existence, it is because the emergent event has been mobilized in the differential of the in-act and the acting. Arakawa and Gins define this differential as “a tentative constructing toward a holding in place.” Scales and speeds coexist in this tentative fragility, reminding us that the procedural must work at differing degrees of intensity. “Everything is tentative, but some things or events have a tentativeness with a faster-running clock than others. So that there can at least be a keeping pace with bioscleave’s tentativeness, it becomes necessary to divine how best to join events into an event-fabric, which surely involves
learning to vary this speed at which one fabricates tentative constructings toward holding in place” (Arakawa and Gins 2002: 48).
