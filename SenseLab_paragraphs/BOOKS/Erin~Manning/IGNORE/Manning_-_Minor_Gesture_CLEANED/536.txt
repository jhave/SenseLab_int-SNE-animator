In my account of what a body can do, I therefore begin with an attention to the question of the “in-act” of the doing. This emphasizes the microgestures of becoming that are in the bodying. These microgestures are a thinking-in-the-act, I argue, not in the sense that they resolve into this or that conscious thought, but in the sense that they are replete with intensity and directionality. Bodying does resolve into this or that form, eventually, but it does not begin there, nor does it remain there. A body is the metastability of those microgestures more than it is a form as such. If we begin with the microgesture, it becomes clear that a body is more associated milieu (Simondon) than form. What a body does is ecological: it becomes in relation to a changing environment, and what it does in that relation is what it is. A body is a tending, an inflection, an incipient directionality. And this incipiency includes a thinking in its own right.
Of course, what a body does always has a place and a time. People often ask how such an account of the body has agency. I prefer the notion of agencement to agency—the sense of directionality occasioned by movement rather than a subject-based intentionality—but however you define this moment of “making a difference,” there is no question that how it individuates in this time and place, in co-composition—or how it matters, here and now—belongs to what a body can do. A body makes a difference in terms of how this or that vector, this or that inflection, alters the conditions of this or that event. So, that a body is black or white or female or transgender does make a difference. Of course it does! But these are less “states” of an existing body than vectors of a becoming-body that themselves change over time. Identity, like individuation, is emergent. What a body can do is change.
