How does the rhythm, the cadence, the intensity of the text compose with its words? Where does thought-feeling escape or resist existing forms of knowledge? All of this before even beginning to explore the question of “where I stand,” which arguably, is the least interesting question of all. For “where I stand,” similar to the ubiquitous “object of study,” is too often the question that stops the process, that takes the writing out of the act, that aligns it to disciplinary method and, by extension, to institutional power. We all do this, of course, to a certain degree, but it seems to me that what study can do exceeds the kind of self-situating that too often becomes the death-knell of creative acts of reading (and, of course, of making). Another kind of stand must be taken, one that erupts from the midst, one that engages sympathetically with the unknowable at the heart of difference, one that heeds the uneasiness of an experience that cannot yet be categorized. Otherwise we find ourselves right back where we started: outside looking in at what is already recognizable, at what is already knowable.
