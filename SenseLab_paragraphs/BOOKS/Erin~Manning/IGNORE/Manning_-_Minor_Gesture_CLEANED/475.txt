The ndeup is a ritual practice that involves the careful crafting of techniques to create a group-subject. As with all rituals, certain precise procedures have to be followed. Solomon explains: “The first thing we had was a shopping list. We had to buy seven yards of African fabric. We had to get a calabash, which was a large bowl fashioned from a gourd. We had to get three kilos of millet. We had to get sugar and kola beans. And then we had to get two live cockerels, two roosters, and a ram.” These effects were purchased at the market, except the ram, which was bought by the side of the road. Then Solomon headed to what would become a full-day ritual. By early afternoon, the ritual really got going.
