Our debts stay bad because we are owed as much as we owe. We are owed a better world. We are owed reparations for the racism, for the sexism, for the horrors of the genocides we have survived, for the sexual abuse we have lived through. We are owed for the judgments we face each day in a world that refuses to accommodate us, a world that excludes us from proper education. And we owe. We owe the environment better conditions for surviving, for thriving. We owe our children more opportunities for movement, for independent exploration. We owe the woman who sleeps on the street. We owe the drug addict who suffers from mental illness. We owe the black man who canâ€™t walk safely at night. We owe the Indigenous women who keep disappearing.2 None of this is in question. We are owed. And we owe.
