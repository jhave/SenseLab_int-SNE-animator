What is most interesting about a procedural approach, it should be clear by now, is not the final form a process might take. What is at stake is the shaping itself—how a form might be capable of remaining procedural, and, even more so, how its procedurality is capable of keeping minor gestures alive. In the case above, both architectures remain procedural, but they do so to different degrees. What matters is how these degrees are taken up in experience. What matters is what new processes they enable: what new modes of existence they solicit, what minor tendencies they call forth. What matters is how the work is attended to in the modality of sited awareness, how its instauration is felt and how the work’s faire oeuvre persists, persuasively. What matters is how the event continues to be procedurally capable of carrying the untimeliness of event-time—“Oh! That’s what it was!”—while operatively attending to the singularity of the event in this iteration of its coming-to-be. For work that works does take a stand. It stands in the time in which it lands, and it makes demands on that time. It marks it. A procedural architecting, a procedural fashioning, always involves an encounter with a work that persists even as it stands, that engages with the openings of potential even as it takes its place, here and now.
