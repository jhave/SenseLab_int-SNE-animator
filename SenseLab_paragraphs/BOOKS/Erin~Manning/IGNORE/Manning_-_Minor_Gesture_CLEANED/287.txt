This history of an openness to the line—think the kimono as an assemblage of straight lines—an openness that at all stages of the process inquires not into the fit of the garment according to preestablished bodyconstraints but into its material potential, is perhaps what gives Kawakubo the confidence to ask her pattern-makers to work collaboratively with materials before even thinking of the form they can create. She mentions, for instance, giving her pattern-makers a crumpled piece of paper with an invitation to create something beyond a form, something that is not yet clothing, not yet architecture, but a mode of existence that brings both into tentative appearance (Rissanen 2007: 3).
