When deconstruction is theorized in relation to Kawakubo’s work (as well as other Japanese designers, such as Yohji Yamamoto), it tends to denote the making apparent of the seams of a garment in a way that creates a conversation about the garment’s form. It foregrounds the unfinished seams, for instance, and tends to make a statement about counterculture (emphasizing, for instance, the way a given designer refuses to conform to haute couture’s norms). Derrida’s definition of the term takes it much further. For Derrida, deconstruction is never a method, but rather a way to return again to the act of reading or making in order to see how it stages its alliances to form, to history, to epistemology.15 This approach encourages an account of how the work moves, and what it can do in its incipient activity. In the case of fashion, this encourages a turn not to the form itself but to the materiality of construction itself, to the ways in which the deconstructive gesture activates the force of form.
