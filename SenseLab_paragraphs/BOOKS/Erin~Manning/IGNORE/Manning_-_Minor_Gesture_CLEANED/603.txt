The figure of the student is a good starting point for thinking debt. Moten and Harney write: “Credit pursues the student, offering to match credit for debt, until enough debts and enough credits have piled up. But the student has a habit, a bad habit. She studies. She studies but she does not learn. If she learned they could measure her progress, establish her attributes, give her credit. But the student keeps studying, keeps planning to study, keeps running to study, keeps studying a plan, keeps elaborating a debt. The student does not intend to pay” (2013: 62). She studies. She learns for learning’s sake. She learns beyond credit. She learns to forget. She learns by heart, beyond the page. She takes the risk of knowing differently. She cannot pay because she will never have stopped studying, will never have stopped inventing what it means to study.
