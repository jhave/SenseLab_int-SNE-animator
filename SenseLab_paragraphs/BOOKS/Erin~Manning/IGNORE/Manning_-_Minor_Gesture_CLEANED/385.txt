With carrying as a motif, I will continue to use agencement as the concept best capable of carrying agency. Agencement, whose synonyms include “accommodation,” “adjustment,” “arrangement,” “composition,” “contexture,” carries with it a sense of a mobilizing—its movement-toward has an undeniable effect on the conditions of experience in their unfolding. Often read in conjunction with Foucault’s concept of the dispositif (translated as “apparatus”), it has also come to have political connotations in the French, linking it to micropolitics and regimes of power. Agencement: the directed intensity of a compositional movement that alters the field of experience. Agencement directs how the event comes to subjective form. This subjective form is not stable across regions of time and space. It is emergent and co-compositional. It is how the event actualizes as event. But as I have mentioned before, this actualization is brief, always already on the cusp of perishing. What is left over, the fullness of its feelings as yet unactualized, is the conduit for new occasions of experience. When Blackman writes that her feelings “are my carrying . . . vibrations, flashes, visual-blocks, touchhorrors, smell-tickles and the cross-over that comes from them,” what she is saying, it seems to me, is that experience doesn’t easily resolve for her. Subjective forms are elusive. What is far more current in her experience are carrying-feelings, feelings that do not emerge from a stable place (i.e., a predefined body) or land in any kind of predictable formation. Feelings remain lures.
