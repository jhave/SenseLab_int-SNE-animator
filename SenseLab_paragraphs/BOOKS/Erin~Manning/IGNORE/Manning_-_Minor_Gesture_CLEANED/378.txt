Carrying moves the noun. With this motor attached to it, the noun becomes a field of sensation, making felt the ineffable more-than of perception, the welling nonconscious activity of experience in the making. As an autistic writing herself into neurotypical experience, Blackman feels the carrying needs to be edited out—not experientially, of course, but linguistically. The more-than of experience in the making must be left unspoken. And yet this more-than cannot so easily be excised. It remains active, despite her desire to background it. We hear it in her descriptions of neurodiversity—it lurks in her prose, it enlivens her metaphors. It is there when she talks about her experience of a body, articulating the difficulty she has in defining where the body ends and the world begins. It is there when she speaks of the challenge of moving in a world that refuses to settle itself into a stable locus where objects and subjects are clearly differentiated. It is there when she writes of memory, articulating the difference between a kind of experiential memory felt in the moving and a linguistic memory activated for the telling. Everywhere, Blackman’s experience is one of carrying, one that privileges the felt experience of emergent relation. For her, a body is a carrying-across, a relational field that incorporates the environment in its infinite metamorphosis. It is an orbit that includes even as it creates, an orbit that cannot be abstracted from the vibrations, flashes, triggers that cross over into the world in-forming, an orbit that is less a body as such than the activity of crossing, the activity of aligning. An orbit is not a site, Blackman emphasizes again and again, but a region, an opening onto experience, a co-composition with a world in the making. A worlding.
