The schism between expression and enunciation, the intense passage between petrification and spark, the shape of enthusiasm that bodies, these are schizoanalytic tendencies. Or, to put it differently, the schizoanalytic, the “non-I” of the double which expresses itself as the schizo-flux in AntiOedipus, can be felt in the bodying-forth that composes at the edges of language where the movement of thought is most active. Schizoanalysis composes with autistic perception.
