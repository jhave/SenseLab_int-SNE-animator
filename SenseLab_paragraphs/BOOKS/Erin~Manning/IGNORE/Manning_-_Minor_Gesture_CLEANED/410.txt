In the case of the autistic, things may not go so smoothly. First, hunger and impulse-control may be overlaid, leading toward actions that are more confusing than those outlined above. Blackman speaks of her echolalic tendency of saying “McDonald’s” whenever she sees the large M of the restaurant’s “golden arches.” This tends to lead people to assume that she wants to eat there, when in fact she doesn’t like the food. She writes: [In crowded restaurants] I reverted to asking for food that I associated with that kind of interaction, but this was less a request for what I really wanted to eat as a memory process. I had to make do with what I had preprogrammed, much as the way I would ask for a hamburger if I saw a McDonald’s. I learned this was involuntary the day we were standing on a pedestrian crossing in sight of the big gold M. We were talking about where we would have lunch, and I typed, “please don’t let me make you go to mcdonald’s!” As I got to “the M word,” my voice cut in and I declaimed “McDonal’!!” while physically tugging at my bewildered companion so forcibly that we ended up through the sliding doors and in the line of surf-crazy youngsters almost before she was aware of it, and certainly before she could begin to analyze her own responses.
