Undoing experience of its reordering through the figure of the stable “I,” schizoanalysis is concerned first and foremost with opening experience to its prepersonal singularities. This enables it to compose well with autistic perception and to design techniques that honor its precarity. For schizoanalysis is allergic to all neurotypical commands. “The task of schizoanalysis is to tirelessly undo egos and their presuppositions; to liberate the prepersonal singularities they enclose and repress; to mobilize the flows they would be capable of transmitting, receiving or intercepting; to establish always further and more sharply the schizzes and the breaks well below conditions of identity; to mount the desiring machines that cut across each and group it with others. For each is a groupuscule and must live as such. . . . Schizoanalysis is so named because throughout its entire process of treatment it schizophrenizes, instead of neuroticizing, like psychoanalysis” (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 434, translation modified).
