In the second iteration of this process of experimentation (of which there have been five so far), fifty analog speakers were connected to a max msp patch and distributed in the space, activated in relay. In a third iteration, light and movement sensors were placed in the environment, multiplying the conditions through which sound data was transduced from the environment into the software. Tiny computer fans were also mobilized in this iteration, though never successfully connected to the system. Nonetheless, they provided a complexity to the field through the background sound and subtle air currents their movements produced. A future proposition would be to link the air current to the responsive environment.
