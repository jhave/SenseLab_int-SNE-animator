There’s something about writing books that is out of time. As though the writing only really knows what it’s after once it has begun to make its way into the world. For me, thinking too has always had this quality: thinking thickens in its encounter with the futurity that orients it. This futurity in thinking’s presentness is part of what keeps thinking lithe: thinking is always out of sync with itself.
The best kind of encounter with thinking’s outside is the kind that deeply listens to what writing is trying to do, almost thinking beyond what the author is capable of thinking, then returning that thinking, almost beyond what the reader can think, to the author. In this gesture of encounter, no one is trying to convince anyone: thought is thinking collectively at its limit.
