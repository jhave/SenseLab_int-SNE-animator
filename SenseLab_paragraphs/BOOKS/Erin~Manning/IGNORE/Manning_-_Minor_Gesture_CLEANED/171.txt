It is impossible to think intuition and sympathy as wholly separate from one another, but neither should we consider them the same. Intuition touches on the differential of a process, and sympathy holds the contrasts in the differential together, such that, coupled with the minor gesture, the ineffable becomes expressive. Sympathy, allied with the minor gesture, is the conduit for the expression of a certain encounter already held in germ. Where intuition is the force of expression or prearticulation of an eventâ€™s welling into itself, sympathy, calling forth the minor gesture, is the way of its articulation.
