Arno Boehler (AB): Do we know what a body can do?
Erin Manning (EM): For me, what a body can do has been a key question for the past decade. My own approach to the question has been to move toward the prelinguistic and ask how movement activates a body in the midst of a process of becoming. I call this bodying. Working through a lexicon of movement in its preacceleration—before displacement as such—I have wanted to explore how movement activates a modality of thought that is of the becoming-body. Such a thinking cannot be directly articulated in language, and yet it is a thinking (or a thinking-feeling) in its own right. A thinking in the moving. What’s interesting about this is that it moves thought from a category of organization toward an expression of difference. Thought in the moving is the activation of a differential. It is the making-felt of a changing relationscape. So, I suppose the first answer I could give is that what a body can do is think, in the moving.
I spend a lot of time watching bodies move—in the subway, on the street, in the classroom, in the studio. And I ask myself two questions: what makes us so certain that thinking is not in-the-moving, or in-thefeeling; and what makes us so certain that we can define a body in time and space as a separate and individual entity? These are old Cartesian categories, the first putting thought in the mind, out of the body; the second placing the body outside of its relation to the world. Whatever makes it possible for us to think of a body as defined apart from its participation in the world is the same thing that allows us to believe that thought can be contained by language, apart from the movements that generate it.
