The facilitator must therefore be seen as more than a person. They are carriers, conduits for the modulation of an eventful environment. Through a relationship of trust and understanding, autistic and facilitator work together to tune the complexity of communication—both linguistic and nonlinguistic—toward language in ways that do not erase the complexity of the minor gestures at the heart of field attention. Affect is not cast aside, but is conducted in ways that better align with written communication. Facilitation is possible only if the autistic does not feel judged. He must be secure in his intelligence and trust the facilitator to help him create the conditions for communicating his singular way of seeing the world. But even more than that: he must trust the relation’s capacity to create pathways for a composing analogous at least in some regard to his lived experience of autistic perception. In this facilitation of facilitation there emerges the capacity for the environment to come to attention in a way that facilitates the invention of new modes of expression.
