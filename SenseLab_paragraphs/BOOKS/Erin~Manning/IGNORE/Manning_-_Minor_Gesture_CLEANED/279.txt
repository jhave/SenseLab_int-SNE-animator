The minor gesture makes ingression into the procedure at just this intersection: the minor gesture lands onto tentativeness. In landing onto tentativeness, the minor gesture opens up the field of relation, making felt how the field is, by its very nature, co-compositional. In this tentative field of relation made felt by the minor gesture, “how the body moves determines what turns out to hold together as architecture for it.” The action does not belong to a preconstituted body. Body is “tentative constructing toward holding in place.”
