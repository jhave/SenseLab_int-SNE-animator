Another word for the tragic Deleuze uses is “dramatization.” The way the event activates the field of relation can be thought of as a dramatization of that field. How the will to power acts dramatizes the stakes, in the event, of the occasion’s coming-to-be. Each activation, each act, is dramatic in that it lays claim to having become in just this way. “Nietzsche creates his own method: dramatic, typological and differential” (Deleuze 2002: 197).
