It is neither of the present, of the past nor of the future. It is pulled across times in the making, felt in its resonance. The almost shapes the present-passing without inflecting it, yet it contributes to the ways the inflection can create new directionalities. It is important to not place the inflection in the realm of human intentionality. Movement inflects due to movement’s own processes. This does not mean that the human has no role to play. Of course how the body moves has effects, and there is no end to inflections activated by tendings that include the human. It’s just that the intention is not where we usually assume it is. It is in the event, in the ecology. Perhaps one way of thinking inflection as more-than human is through gravity. Gravity acts on the body. It activates vertical movements, moving organs, limbs toward the earth. It also activates lateral movements, widening, pulling toward depth of field.
Gravity can be defined as directional activity in the event’s coming to be.
