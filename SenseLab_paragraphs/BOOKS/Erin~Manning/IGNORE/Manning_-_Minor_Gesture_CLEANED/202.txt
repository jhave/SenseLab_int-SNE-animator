The minor gesture emerges from within the field itself: it is a gesture that leads the field of experience to make felt the fissures and openings otherwise too imperceptible or backgrounded to ascertain. A minor gesture is a gesture that tweaks the experiential to make its qualitative operations felt, a gesture that opens experience to its limit.
A minor gesture cannot be known as such. It is what the minor does within the field of experience that makes its gesture felt. In the field of art, the artwork, the object, or even the effect created by an ephemeral composition is not, in itself, a minor gesture.
