Art can make this more-than of the object felt. This happens through art’s capacity to bring event-time to expression. This crafting of the art of time involves the activation of time’s differential. This activation of the dynamic difference, in the event, between what was and what will be, creates a memory of the future.3 This memory of the future, activated by the minor gesture, is a feltness, in the event, of a tendency. When art is at its most operational, this tendency does not settle in the object. It moves across it, pushing the now of experience in the making to its limit. Here, in the uneasy opening between now and now, art’s manner is felt.
