In 2006, I began work on a piece entitled Weather Patterns: Entertaining the Environment. This artwork, which is still evolving, is less about creating a finished work than about putting into play a proposition: how to work with different technologies to activate a field of relation that, while it includes the human, does not depend on the human. When I began the work, I hadnâ€™t considered the concept of a minor gesture, but now I can see that it was indeed the question of the minor gesture that was at work from the very outset: what would a work be like that was capable of opening up the question of interaction and, ideally, of emergent relation, toward a morethan-human perspective? What would a work look like that was capable of making felt something akin to the reddening of time of a summer tending to autumn? How would a work work whose main concern was how the field of relation itself touches the limit of the sensible? What would a work be that was capable of awakening and keeping alive the intensive variability of the artful?
