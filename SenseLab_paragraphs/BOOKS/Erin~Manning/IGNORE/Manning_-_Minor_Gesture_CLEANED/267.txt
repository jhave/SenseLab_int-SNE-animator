Kawakubo emphasizes that the intuitive problem, the problem that opens experience, cannot be searched out from beyond the bounds of a given process, cannot be found in a world preconstituted. She writes: “Going around museums and galleries, seeing films, talking to people, seeing new shops, looking at silly magazines, taking an interest in the activities of people in the street, looking at art, travelling: all these things are not useful, all these things do not help me, do not give me any direct stimulation to help my search for something new. And neither does [the] fashion history. The reason for that is that all these things above already exist.”3 Kawakubo is not inspired by the already existent configurations that make up our worlds. She wants to create at their interstice, in their coming-to-be: “In order to make this ss14 collection, I wanted to change the usual route within my head. I tried to look at everything I look at in a different way. I thought a way to do this was to start out with the intention of not even trying to make clothes. I tried to think and feel and see as if I wasn’t making clothes.”4 The enabling constraint here is clear: to work from the perspective of a new way of seeing, in the event. The intuition will emerge in the process, creating the problem in the art of time if Kawakubo doesn’t assume she already knows what fashion can do.
