The critique of Occupy is one based on the alignment between politics and the grand gesture. Because the protest was open, because it was lively with minor gestures, because it was capable of morphing, its shape has radically changed in the many iterations it has spawned. When we look at political unrest today, when we look at emergent collectivity around the world, we see not “Occupy” but what Occupy allowed to proliferate. Occupy set into motion something already in act and gave it the momentum it needed to reinvent itself. This is how a politics of the minor gesture does its work.
