It seems to me that there is more agency in agencement than there is in its usual alignment to an identity category. If we take the field of movement in its capacity for differentiation as the motor for change, there are a lot more openings for difference. The difficulty is in harnessing this potential without backgrounding its co-compositional nature. This is where technique comes in.
