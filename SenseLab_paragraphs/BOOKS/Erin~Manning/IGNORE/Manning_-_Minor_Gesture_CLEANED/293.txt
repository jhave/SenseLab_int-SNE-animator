Look again. Now see the tentative architectures. See the movement that was made invisible by the tendency to abstract textile from body. See the backpack, see the cross-body purse. See the puffy coat with the baby underneath, collar slightly open for its head. See what you see every day from November to March in your cold climate and wonder again why when you saw it in the subway, on the street, in the café, you didn’t see it as a disfigurement. Wonder at how quickly just yesterday you were able to see this body-dressed-for-winter as a body separate from its fashioning, at how quickly you unburdened the skin-envelope from its Michelin Man coat. And note in surprise what Kawakubo’s work has given you: a new mode of perception. Now look again and see not the clothing that masks a moving body, but a shape in the making that includes movement, that includes textile, that includes body, the three together an ecology that is an emergent bodying, a procedural fashioning. Note with some awe that the “Dress Becomes Body” collection is not the high and inaccessible fashion you may have assumed it was, but a lively encounter with the everyday.
