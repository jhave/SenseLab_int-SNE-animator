In Blackman’s case, this would already be difficult were her movements through the world predictable. But they aren’t. Like so many other classical autistics, body and world co-compose to a large degree in ways that are nonlinear and unforeseeable. Higashida writes: “Your vestibular and proprioceptive senses are . . . out of kilter, so the floor keeps tilting like a gerry in heavy seas, and you’re no longer sure where your hands and feet are in relation to the rest of you . . . Even your sense of time has gone, rendering you unable to distinguish between a minute and an hour, as if you’ve been entombed in an Emily Dickinson poem about eternity, or locked into a time-bending Science Fiction film” (2013: loc. 45). “Even before we start interacting,” writes Blackman, “we are handicapped. Our eyes and brain don’t always process colour and depth very well, and these are the basis of ‘reading’ faces. And then we have problems with sequencing movement, and this is how most people interpret body language and expression” (2013: 8). Without a clear sense of linear or metric time, without a strong sense of depth perception, with a shifting panoply of edgings of color and texture, how to field experience in a way that enables the kind of parsing necessary for so many neurotypically inclined tasks?
