To begin with research-creation is to immediately situate the force of the minor gesture in the activity of the differential. The differential, the active hyphen that brings making to thinking and thinking to making, ensures that research-creation remain an ecology of practices. This ecology of practices needs a punctual proto-event such as the minor gesture to bring its potential into focus. The minor gesture activates the differential such that the ecology’s incipient heterogeneity becomes operational. When this happens, something has begun to take form that exceeds the registers of making on one end and thinking on the other. A movement of thought, as Bergson might say, becomes active, and in this activity a new register begins to take shape. This new register is neither art per se nor philosophy: it is study, it is practice, it is speculation.
In most cases research-creation as an academic category is directly concerned with artistic practice. Combined with study, however, the emphasis moves toward the exploration of how modes of making and thinking become consolidated in emergent, collective forms of practice that are artful, if not necessarily artistic in the strong sense. The artful, or what Raymond Ruyer (1958) calls “the aesthetic yield,” is defined throughout as the in-act of the more-than where the force of form remains emergent. Artful practices honor complex forms of knowing and are collective not because they are operated upon by several people, but because they make apparent, in the way they come to a problem, that knowledge at its core is collective. Practices that think multiply are many: they can be activist practices, environmental practices, social practices. They can involve child-rearing, social work, teaching, playing. They can take place on a park bench, in the city, in the classroom, in the kitchen. To think multiply is to think in the register of the hyphen, of the differential, in the complex field of study opened up by the undercommons.
