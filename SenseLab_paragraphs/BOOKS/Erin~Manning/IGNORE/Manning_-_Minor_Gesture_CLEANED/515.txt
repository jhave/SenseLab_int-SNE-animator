This is what Deleuze and Guattari emphasize throughout AntiOedipus: schizoanalysis reinvents itself through each of its desiring operations. It cannot be contained or described: it is always in the act. This attention to the difference between the schizoid pole and the production of the schizophrenic as an individual is similar to the distinction I make between autism as a medical category and autistic perception. I am not making a value judgment on autism when I describe autistic perception, nor am I suggesting that all of autism can be subsumed under its mantle. Rather, I am drawing attention to a perceptual tendency that seems to be extremely pronounced within the autistic community, and also present in each of us who figure elsewhere on the spectrum of neurodiversity. This perceptual tendency reminds us that there is no preconstituted body that stands outside the act of perception, and that objects and subjects are eventful emergences of a relational field in emergence.
