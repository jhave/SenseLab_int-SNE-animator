Despite its role as a founding gesture of humanism, of individualism, neurotypicality remains for the most part in the background of our everyday lives. Certainly, activists who fight for neurodiversity are very aware of how neurotypicality frames experience. But for the rest of us, neurotypicality as such tends to be backgrounded, and so we underestimate both its force and its pervasiveness. Issues that most readily define neurotypicality as foundational are often seen as given. We pay them little attention: we don’t tend, for instance, to question the abortion of vast numbers of Down syndrome fetuses. Or we don’t think of mental illness as on a spectrum with our own neurology. Or we ignore how pervasive it is not to create robust accommodations for difference and rarely organize events with accommodation in mind. We don’t concern ourselves with the fact that, too often, people with disabilities, intellectual or physical, are offered
palliative care instead of life-sustaining treatment for diseases. We too often see all of these scenarios—if we do see them at all—simply as aspects of existence at this current juncture: they are what they are, and surely they have come to be for a reason.
