The word “art” (die Art) in German means “manner” or “mode.” While it’s true to say that Kunst is the term in German currently used for art, might there be a recuperable trace of this early meaning in contemporary notions of artistic practice? Might there be a way to reclaim the processual that has increasingly become backgrounded in the definition of art as tied to an object?
