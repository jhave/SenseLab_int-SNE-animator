Volumetrics, on the other hand, seemed to read more as a stable object, its black volumes deadening participation. Perhaps it was its blackness, perhaps it was the large size of the individual pieces or their weight, or perhaps it was how the pieces read in the context of contemporary art’s interest in the minimal (often untouchable) object, for the black volumes do on their own give off a sense of elusiveness that the Folds to Infinity collection does not. Whatever the reason, it was noteworthy that on the few occasions when the two collections were exhibited together, the black volumes tended to be left untouched. This led to the slow incubation of the problem of how to generate a weather pattern with Volumetrics, one that included the human but didn’t depend on human participation.
