Neurodiverse modes of existence must be created, and they must compose across difference in ways that remain mobile, in the act. Pathology is not the answer. Co-composition across the spectrum is necessary, as much between the precarity of the shape of enthusiasm at its two poles as on the spectrum of our collective difference, autistic or not. For we all have access to autistic perception, and we are all susceptible to falling into depression. For those of us for whom autistic perception comes less quickly, less easily, perhaps, as I’ve suggested before, it’s time to learn to chunk less, to refrain from quick categorization. This will likely not end neoliberalism, but it will continue the engaging process of inventing what life can do when it composes across collective resonances that listen to dissonance.
