Whitehead’s theory of feeling catapults the notion of human-limited participation on its head. What the feeling has felt is how the event has come to expression. The subject, the individual, is its aftermath, how it will have come to know itself. The subject is not limited to the human—it is the marker of a dephasing, in Simondon’s terms, in the event. An occasion of experience always holds such a marker—once it has come to concrescence, it will always be what it was. This is what Whitehead calls the superject, or the subject of experience. Making the subject the outcome of the event rather than its initiator reminds us that the subject of an event includes its vector quality—in Massumi’s terms, its thinking-feeling. The subject can never be abstracted or separated out from the vector quality, the “feeling-tone” which co-composed it.
