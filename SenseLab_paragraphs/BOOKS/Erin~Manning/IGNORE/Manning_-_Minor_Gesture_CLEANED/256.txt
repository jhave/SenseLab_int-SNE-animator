In the everyday, habit operates as a choreographic tool. It directs our movement, organizes our time, makes experience predictable, framing it in ways that are usually associated with comfort and well-being, two concepts that make Arakawa and Gins highly suspicious. For well-being and comfort too often keep us in the same place, a place we return to daily without much thought, a place that doesnâ€™t encourage experimentation. This place, framed as it is by the architectures that surround us, is anything but procedural, they argue.
