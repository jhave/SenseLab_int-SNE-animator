Blackman writes: “I love getting flashes of autistic perception. This is a picture of what my brain makes of what I see, hear and feel from my skin, balance and body-in-space. That is who I am. That is how I felt almost continuously as a child. As an adult I can see and hear much more like typical people, but my underlying brain processes are still quite different” (2013: 117). Forcing herself to write independently has in some senses been a loss for Blackman, who feels that the emphasis on certain ways of coming to cognition has depleted her experience of autistic perception and, with it, affected the poetics of autie-type. Likening language to “a chaotic sludge [which] transforms to clarity in intent” (2013: 106), Blackman mourns her poetic voice:
My inside language had changed completely. Previously my mind and my voice had warbled and cooed in unison, and my typed language and my visual words were positively reinforced by that magical process. . . . In a path to rather more typical language processing, I lost the most precious gift of the poetry of thought, of a dancing and swooping mind and body. . . . Of course, I still had most wonderful control of words and I drew great pleasure from fluent prose writing, but had more thoughtwork in putting the characters in my brain through my finger and onto a screen. In my mind I had words, but I had not retained the gift of autistic enjoyment to the extent I had before. (2013: 106)
