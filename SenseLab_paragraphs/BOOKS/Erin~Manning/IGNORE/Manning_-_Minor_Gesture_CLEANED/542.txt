One way I think about the care for the event in the event is in terms of what I call the dance of attention. Not human attention, but field attention—the event’s attention to its own development, its own concrescence. When it is strong, that’s when we leave a dance performance, for instance, and say: “Wow, that really worked!” What is felt in such instances is the lived intensity of the event’s capacity to create a field of experience. There is little in our everyday lives that facilitates this kind of dance of attention, but it does take place. It seems to me that it would be important to work harder to develop techniques that allow for that dance of attention to be awakened or energized, to be made possible. It is there, it is latently there, I think, all the time. But it can be overcoded by the habitual tendencies of subject-centered intentionality that work continuously to take us out of the field of relation and into the individual, as though the individual could be cordoned out from the event. The techniques to be invented are ones that open the perceptual register beyond intentionality to the thought-in-the-moving of the complex emergent patterns of our daily lives.
