Socializing for two is therefore always less “for two” than about the more-than one. It is the more-than that is sought in the mirror imaging, a more-than that can act as both the activator and the stabilizer of movement-moving. The facilitator acts as a bridge, Blackman suggests. This is not a bridge between two precomposed subjects, but within a field of tendencies that work together to create a momentary boundedness. This boundedness continues to carry a certain mobility, tending in ways that facilitate the production of sense out of welter without negating the fullness of experience. When facilitation tunes toward communication, the bridge similarly allows sense-making to keep its complexity. This is not to suggest, of course, that writing is the only way to communicate. Autistic experience is lively with forms of communication “beneath the words.” As Amelia Baggs has shown in her important video In My Language, all language cannot be reduced to the spoken/written word. What of the language of movement, of texture, the language of sound merging with color, of edgings vibrating to the rhythm of weather patterns, of thoughts lingering in the prearticulation where words are not yet? Sadly, too often, written communication trumps nonconscious forms of communication: in a largely neurotypically inflected society, written communication continues to be what most strongly demarcates the “intelligent” from the “nonintelligent.”
