The envelope has been ruptured. We are accustomed to the act of excision, of subtraction. Parsing is what we neurotypicals are best at. We see the winter-clad body with its thick coat, the knapsack, the heavy bag, and we simply excise them from existence. We assume that the body is the shape underneath instead of the force taking form of an ecology, instead of a speciation. What else does that mean we don’t see?
The “Dress Becomes Body” collection is a world-constituting procedure for autistic perception: Kawakubo has created a shaping that refuses to celebrate the parsings that make reflective consciousness the order of the day, and she has made it available to all of us. With “Dress Becomes Body” she has introduced us to a modality of perception not so far from our everyday experience that we can’t account for it once it’s made available for perception, and yet far enough that we perhaps realize how we’ve become distanced from the operative interstitiality of modes of existence in-forming.
