This is not to say that there isn’t activity in negation. Negative critique’s work is to actively trace what the event cannot do. This is an acting, but one that knows, in advance, what the orientation will be. For negative critique can only be for or against. For-against is the gesture of the either-or. The stakes are clear. This makes negative critique deeply complicit with the way things are. It is in this sense that negation remains, always, in the it is, even when its stance may be heard as the it is not.
Affirmation does not do its work in the register of contradiction. It does not dwell in the either-or. It does not set up the stage in advance and work backward from its position-taking. This is why for affirmation, it is never a question of making-active from the perspective of reactivity. In affirmation there is no reactivity. Affirmation activates in the activity of the event. It activates in the folds of the event’s creases, connecting with their own becoming-active. There is always more for affirmation, more-than.
