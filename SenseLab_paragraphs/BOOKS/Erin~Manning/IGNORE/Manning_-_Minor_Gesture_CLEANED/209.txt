A ritual object is always singular-multiple in the sense that even if it is used alone, it carries the force of the differential of all past rituals and all future rituals. The object is in this sense less object than stand-in for the unfathomable force of the not-yet. This not-yet is dynamic: it activates time, folding futurity into a pastness that pulls the present into itself. The ritual object is therefore not a thing in itself: its presence is not meaning-oriented in a semiotic sense. It is a carrying-over that acts as transducer for the object’s immanent force. The object can therefore never be simply reduced to its form. Nor can it be counted as such (as “this” one). The object is always many, always more than one. The ritual object is less a form than a materialforce: it acts as the intercessor into the ritual that opens experience to its differential.
