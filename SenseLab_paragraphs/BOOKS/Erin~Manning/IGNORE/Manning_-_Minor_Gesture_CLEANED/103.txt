A process must determine its own reason. Any attempt to chart in advance the interplay between the anarchic fullness of experience welling and the cut of actualization into determinateness of an eventâ€™s comingto-be, stems the potential for difference. This renders experience stillborn: an event accounted for outside its own evolution is an event that has already been taken out of its liveness and organized within the bounds of preexisting forms of knowledge. Life cannot be lived better in retrospect, as Nietzsche warns.
