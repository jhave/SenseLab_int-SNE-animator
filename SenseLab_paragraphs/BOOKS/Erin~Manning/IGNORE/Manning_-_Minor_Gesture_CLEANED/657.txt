2 Throughout the manuscript, as I did with my book Always More Than One (Manning 2013), I toggle between more-than-human and more-than human. For me, the more-than-human is a way of making operative ways of thinking the nonhuman without excising the force of human complicity from these worldings. When I speak of the more-than human, I am focusing on the realm of the human, emphasizing that the category of the human is always modulated and affected by the more-than. In Always More Than One I develop the concept of speciation to account for the intercession of the more-than in what it means to be human. See “Another Regard” in Manning 2013.
