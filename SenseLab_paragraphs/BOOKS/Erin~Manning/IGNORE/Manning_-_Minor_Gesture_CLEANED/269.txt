This process of engaging with the working of the work is what Souriau calls “faire oeuvre.” Like the mode of existence, which composes in the between of existence’s necessity, or existence’s persuasiveness, the oeuvre à faire is the force of making that only knows itself as such after the fact, in the tense of “Oh! This is what I was looking for!” (Souriau 2009: 109).
