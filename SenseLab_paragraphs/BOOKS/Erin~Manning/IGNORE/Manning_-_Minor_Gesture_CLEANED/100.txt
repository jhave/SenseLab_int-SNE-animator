Two kinds of reason are at stake in Whitehead’s account: pragmatic and speculative. On the one hand, reason is the decision-like function that cuts into a process to facilitate its actualization. On the other hand, reason is what activates the more-than of a process, opening it to its potential. Drawing out the bold lines of his analysis, what emerges in Whitehead’s The Function of Reason, I believe, is a call for a speculative pragmatism, speculative in the sense that the process remains open to the more-than, and pragmatic in the sense that it is completely invested in its “something doing.”
