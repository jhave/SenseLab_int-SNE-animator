Often, the object-as-multiple exhibited in the gallery is used to forecast something that happens elsewhere: as participants in the gallery we are invited to look at the wall label to understand the meaning of the objects in front of us, and it is this added-value of the artist statement that gives us a sense of what the work is meant to denote. Outside of the problem of explanation, which to my mind too often reduces the force of art, denotation is not activation. What rituality does is activate. It does so outside of systems of value imposed on it from elsewhere: rituality is considered a practice precisely because it is capable of inventing forms of value emergent from the ritual itself. In the case of artistic exhibitions, too often capitalist prestigevalue frames the work. Just as it was important not to underestimate the crippling agenda of “the object of study” as foregrounded by Moten and Harney in relation to the undercommons, it is important not to deny the disabling force of the statement that promises to encapsulate and direct the art object. For if art needed to be explained in words, it wouldn’t need to be art. This is not to say, of course, that words cannot be art. But in this case, when language becomes artful, words operate differently. They are used not to denote but to make felt the beneathness of language in the crafting.
