The term Moten and Harney propose for the crafting of problems is study, emphasizing that study is not a place where everyone “dissolves into a student” but where there is the acknowledgment that there is no way “of being intellectual that isn’t social.” In a conversation between himself, Stevphen Shukaitis, and Stefano Harney, Moten explains:
When I think about the way we use the term “study,” I think we are committed to the idea that study is what you do with other people. It’s talking and walking around with other people, working, dancing, suffering, some irreducible convergence of all three, held under the name of speculative practice. The notion of a rehearsal—being in a kind of workshop, playing in a band, in a jam session, or old men sitting on a porch, or people working together in a factory—there are these various modes of activity. The point of calling it “study” is to mark that the incessant and irreversible intellectuality of these activities is already present. These activities aren’t ennobled by the fact that we now say, “oh, if you did these things in a certain way, you could be said to be have been studying.” To do these things is to be involved in a kind of common intellectual practice. What’s important is to recognize that that has been the case—because that recognition allows you to access a whole, varied, alternative history of thought. (Moten and Harney 2013: 109–110)
