According to Bifo, Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of desire “is in itself a force of liberation, and thus we did not see the pathogenic effects of the acceleration and intensification of the info-stimuli, that are linked to the formation of the electronic infosphere and to precarization of work.” And yet Deleuze and Guattari are at pains throughout Anti-Oedipus to emphasize that desire is not reducible to a force of liberation. As Guattari explains in an interview after the book’s publication: “Our conception of desire was completely contrary to some ode to spontaneity or a eulogy to some unruly liberation. It was precisely in order to underline the artificial, ‘constructivist’ nature of desire that we defined it as ‘machinic’: which is to say articulated with the most actual, the most ‘urgent’ machinic types. . . . Desire appears to me as a process of singularization, as a point of proliferation and of possible creation at the heart of a constituted system” (in Genosko 1996: 128). No mode of existence is outside the workings of desire, Deleuze and Guattari argue. “In truth, social production is desiring production itself under determinate conditions. We maintain that the social field is immediately traversed by desire, that it is the historically determined product of desire, and that libido has no need of any mediation or sublimation, any psychic operation, any transformation in order to invest the productive forces and the relations of production. There is only desire and the social and nothing else” (1983: 29, translation modified). To think the shape of enthusiasm in its precarity is to emphasize the materiality of Deleuze and Guattari’s argument in Anti-Oedipus: “Desire produces the real, or stated another way, desiring production is nothing else than social production” (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 30, translation modified).
