Most of our education systems are based on starting from stillness. We learn in chairs. We associate concentration with being quiet. We discourage the movement of thought we call daydreaming, particularly in the context of “learning.” We consider the immanent movements of doodling to be a distraction.12 We are told not to fidget. Reason is aligned with keeping the body still. What if instead we invested in movement-moving, asking children not to stop moving but to become increasingly aware of the share of creativity in the incipient directions of the movements that move them? What if we taught them that the ideal posture for learning or listening or “paying attention” was not standing still (or sitting still), but attuning to cues active in the field of relation?13 What if we directly allied the movement of thought to movement-moving? If we took the common event of cueing to movement-moving outlined above as the ground of experience, what else would we become capable of perceiving? What else could learning (and listening and attending) become?
