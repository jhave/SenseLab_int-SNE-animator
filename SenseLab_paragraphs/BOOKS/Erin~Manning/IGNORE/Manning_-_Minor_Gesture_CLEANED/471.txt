Bifo, in a move that troubles me, then turns to Guattari’s writings to explore the omission of depression. In what seems to me a classic psychoanalytic gesture, Bifo analyzes Guattari’s work to see how or why depression was excluded. Turning to Deleuze and Guattari’s writing on desire in Anti-Oedipus, he writes: “Félix did not pay attention to depression, neither as a philosopher, nor as a psychoanalyst. And we can easily understand why. The methodology [démarche] of the Anti-Oedipus is not easy to reconcile with the possibility of delving into depression. Depression is not just a condition among others, in which a machinic unconscious is assembled, made of existential and chaosmotic fragments proceeding from anywhere to everywhere else. The Anti-Oedipus does not know depression; it continuously overcomes, leaping with psychedelic energy over any slowing down and any darkness” (Berardi 2008: 11). Personalizing Guattari, and making the dangerous assumption that writing is an act that should somehow mirror the writer, Bifo continues his analysis: “Félix knew this, I am sure, but he never said as much, not even to himself, and this is why he went to all these meetings with people who didn’t appeal to him, talking about things that distracted him and making lists of deadlines and appointments. And then he would run off, adjusting his glasses to consult his overflowing daily planner. And here again is the root of depression, in this impotence of political will that we haven’t had the courage to admit” (Berardi 2008: 13, translation modified).
