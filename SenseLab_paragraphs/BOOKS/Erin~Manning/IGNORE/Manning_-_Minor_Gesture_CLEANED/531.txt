When the more-than is explored in its effects, a schizoanalytic process has begun. This process, as Deleuze and Guattari demonstrate, is not a method, nor is it a therapy in any conventional sense. It is an emergent attunement to the precarious range of petrification and spark, a tuning toward both the frenzied vocalizations of the autistic and the rock-like silence of the depressive (who may inhabit one and the same bodying). There is no hierarchy here—just a set of productive effects from the disarray of a field in motion. The purpose is not to organize or select, but to make the way for something else to emerge—a collective oinking, an engaged discussion, a mobile patterning. From here, new modes of existence begin to take form.
