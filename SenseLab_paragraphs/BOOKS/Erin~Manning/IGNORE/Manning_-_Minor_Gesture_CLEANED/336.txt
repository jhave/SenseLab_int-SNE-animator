The inflection occurs in the midst even as it marks the eventâ€™s divergence from itself. It is the force of difference that cues a transition. This transition dephases movement-moving. There may be a change in direction, or the movement may seem roughly continuous, but what is certain is that there will be a change in quality. The change in quality shifts the field of movement, altering not only how you move, but how the emergent movement moves you. The ecological effect of the inflection is felt as the sharpening, the lengthening, the deepening, the closing or opening of the field. What is felt is the uneasy twitching of movement-conditions. This attunement to the field in its divergence calls the field to attention. This makes the field lively with attention, an attention that affects the you you are becoming. The field feels poised.9
The poised field is alive with tendencies. Not each tendency will inflect. Many will simply perish, active only as potentiality. This means that their microinflections, while they may have affected the field in minor ways, are not active enough to cause a remarkable transition. There will not have been a transduction, but the tendency for a microdephasing will have been alive for that split second of their contribution to the field in-forming. This will likely only be realized after the fact when the felt effects of the inflection have been consciously absorbed.
