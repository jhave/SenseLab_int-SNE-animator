The art of time is not about definitions so much as about sensations, about the affective force of the making of time where “we are no longer beings but vibrations, effects of resonance, ‘tonalities’ of different amplitudes” (Lapoujade 2010: 9; my translations throughout). Nor is the art of time about economy, about marking the worthiness of a given experience, the usefulness of time spent. “We must become capable of thinking . . . change without anything changing” (Lapoujade 2010: 12). Duration is time felt in the beyond of apparent change, independently of any notion of linear succession.
