Affect is one of the most habitual ways we experience the nonvoluntary in the act. Bergson writes: “The intensity of affective sensations might . . . be nothing more than our consciousness of the involuntary movements which are being begun and outlined” (2007: 35). The force of the affective moves us. When this movement tunes toward an experience that can be defined as such, the conscious share of the nonconscious has briefly made itself felt. Degrees of parsing are possible here. There can, for instance, be a feeling, irreducible to definition but nonetheless semi-consciously ascertained, affectively felt but unarticulated, of an uneasiness or a tremulousness. Or, in cases where affect tunes to emotion, there can be a clearer parsing into the language of a singular feeling. In the second instance, where affect tunes to emotion, there is a shadowing over of the intensity of affect, though an affective trace still remains.
In the case of affect, the involuntary tends to be recognized and even accepted, but only insofar as it is considered to have no real effect on our modalities of existence. For we know well that affect is considered lower on the scale than reason or rationality. All is well with affect as long as ultimately we can hold it back and use our volition to steer our feelings, imposing decision from without. The problem should be clear by now. In transposing reason onto affect we are trying to have it both ways: we want to feel the ineffable, yet deceive ourselves into thinking we can sideline the ineffable and leave the bubbling ground of the welling event when it suits us. We want to believe we can decide where the event will take us. This is a mirage that underestimates the force of the nonvoluntary in our daily lives.
