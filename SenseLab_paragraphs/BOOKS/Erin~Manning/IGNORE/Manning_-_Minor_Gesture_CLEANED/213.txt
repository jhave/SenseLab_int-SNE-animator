Having exhibited in proximity to Song Dong’s work twice, both at the Sydney and the Moscow Biennales (2012, 2013, respectively), and having had my work next to Song Dong’s in the second of these biennales, I have had ample opportunity to explore, in his work, how the multiple might participate in a kind of ritual shift as it enters into the contemporary art exhibition.
