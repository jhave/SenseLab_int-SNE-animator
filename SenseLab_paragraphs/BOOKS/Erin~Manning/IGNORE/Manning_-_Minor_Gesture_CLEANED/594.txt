Joy is tragic in Nietzsche because it touches on the most sensitive nerve, sparking the event toward a transformation that is often painful, and always jarring. Joy is tragic because it touches at the limit where life is most unbearable, exposing lifeâ€™s inexhaustible vitality. Joy is tragic because it does not hide from death and destruction, because it still says yes! in the face of that which most terrifies. It says yes! (and is thus tragic) not because it wants to carry the burden but because it refuses to be passively transformed by a silence that would render it complicit with the nostalgia for the what was.
