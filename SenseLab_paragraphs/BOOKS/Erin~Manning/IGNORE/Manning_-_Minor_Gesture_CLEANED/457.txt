Savarese continues: “I love the phrase ‘more than a thing to ignore.’ Thinking of my first question, I’m almost tempted to say that the fragments of poetry are prose becoming autistic, if by autistic I mean patterned, musically perseverative. Why shouldn’t the things of this world, which neurotypicals often blithely pass over, be keenly, even fiercely, observed? Perhaps the medium of poetry best captures with its interruptive force the rapt attention of autistic engagement. Is there an ethics of seeing implicit in your answer, an injunction to take note, and if so, does it apply to people with autism?” “I cannot speak for other autistic people,” Mukhopadhyay responds. “But with my eyes, I may select a fraction of the environment—say ‘that shadow of a chair’ or ‘that door hinge over there’—and grow my opinions and ideas around it. This creates a defense system for my over-stimulated visual sense organ. (Call it keen observation or any other name.) Maybe poetry happens to grow around these things. Sometimes I write them and other times I discard them because there is ‘too much to write’” (Savarese 2010).
