This poses a significant challenge: how to articulate modes of existence, to articulate fields of experience, that operate as much in the nonconscious as in the conscious realms, how to do so in a language that operates chiefly within the realm of the conscious. Perhaps the first step is not to be too certain of the frame that would separate the nonconscious from consciousness. States of consciousness, Bergson writes, “are processes and not things; . . . if we denote them each by a single word, it is for the convenience of language; that they are alive and therefore constantly changing; that, in consequence, it is impossible to cut off a moment from them without making them poorer by the loss of some impression, and thus altering their quality” (2007: 196). Minor gestures operate at this cusp where the nonconscious and the conscious co-compose, where language operates “beneath the words,” as autistic Amelia (formerly Amanda) Baggs might say (2010). From this position of indeterminacy, of the ineffable, how to make intelligible the singularity of what cannot be measured or categorized but is felt and, in some sense, known? Here, where there is no perceptible difference, as Bergson says, “between foreseeing, seeing and acting,” the minor gesture is key. For the minor gesture can open the way for a different kind of knowing, a knowing in the event, in nonlinear event-time, a knowing that, while impossible to parse, delights in the force of conceptual invention (2007: 198). The minor gesture is an ally of language in the making.
