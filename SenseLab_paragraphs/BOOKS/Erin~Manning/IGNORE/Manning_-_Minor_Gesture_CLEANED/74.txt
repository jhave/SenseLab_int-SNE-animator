Bergson uses music as an example. For some of us, it is very difficult to select out sensory input. To listen to music might be to hear it as a manytimes-unfolding, untimely complexity. It might mean you hear not the tune as such, or the measure, but the music’s differential, its composite and rhythmic force of form. For those of us less attuned to autistic perception, however, this is likely not how we hear it. What we hear instead is a more homogenized version: we consciously reduce the sensation of sound’s intensity to a quantitative magnitude that is averaged out. “Thus when we speak of the intensity of a sound of medium force as a magnitude, we allude principally to the greater or less effort which we should have ourselves to expend in order to summon, by our own effort, the same auditory sensation” (Bergson 2007: 44). This averaging out through consciousness distances us from sound as pure quality: “The sound would remain a pure quality if we did not bring in the muscular effort which produces it or the vibrations which explain it” (2007: 46). In the parsing of sound, the music’s qualitative nuance is diminished.
