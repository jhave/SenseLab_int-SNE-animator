Autistic Thomas McKean describes this well: “I don’t think what I see is what you see. That is unless what you see are vague clouds and shadows of substance. . . . I am pretty good at deciphering what I am looking at now after practice but sometimes I do still have troubles, especially with colors” (in Bogdashina 2005: loc. 576). Blackman’s orbit is also an account of pure experience. Recall that she describes the orbit as only hers insofar as she moves with it. It is not hers in the sense that it belongs to something predetermined as “I.” It is a carrying-feeling, a vibratory moving-with. The world of pure experience orbits as much as it is orbit: it is a world felt in the nonconscious, active in edgings of experience that are more contributory than actual, real but virtual.
To activate pure experience for conscious expression is to move that experience across the carrying toward a vocabulary that stabilizes it, at least to an extent. This is extremely difficult, in no small part because the parsing requires a parsing of sensation into meaning. This challenge is one discussed by all autistics I have come across. It requires a composing-with of perception’s edging into experience, a composing-with of the beneath of words.12 Composing-with always requires a certain reorienting of the experiential. How to articulate in words sensation, rhythm, feeling?
