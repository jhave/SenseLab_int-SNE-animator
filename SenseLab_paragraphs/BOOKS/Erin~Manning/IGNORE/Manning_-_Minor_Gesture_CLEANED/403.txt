Facilitation is usually understood as anathema to independence. In autism research and education, the term facilitated communication has been used, as I mentioned above, to discredit autisticsâ€™ capacity to think and write. A person who needs facilitation is understood to be incapable, to varying degrees, of directing their own experience. All of these beliefs around facilitation are neurotypical to the core. With an account that begins with pure experience, where predetermined subjectivity is not at the forefront, where the event-orienting agencement is what moves experience, facilitation begins to mean something quite different. Is facilitation not everywhere present in experience, all along the spectrum of neurodiversity? What communication could ever happen without agencement? If we consider facilitation as the conduit, the agencement of a field of forces, what movement does not require it? What movement is not directed by it?
