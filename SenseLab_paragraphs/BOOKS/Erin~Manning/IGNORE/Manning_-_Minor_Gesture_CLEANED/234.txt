The mobilization of Weather Patterns over a series of gallery exhibitions, first in Milwaukee (with Nathaniel Stern and Bryan Cera), then in Melbourne (with Andrew Goodman), and finally in Philadelphia, where artists Megan Bridge and Peter Price experimented with it choreographically, allowed us to experience how data—as produced not only by human movement but by all movement—might enable us to experience a quality of environmental relationality that was otherwise imperceptible. This is what I am calling “entertaining the environment,” entertainment here linked strongly to Whitehead’s notion of “presentational immediacy,” the experience of qualitatively felt effects in a relational field.
