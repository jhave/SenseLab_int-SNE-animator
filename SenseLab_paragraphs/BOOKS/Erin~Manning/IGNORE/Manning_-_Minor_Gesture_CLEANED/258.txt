In creating conditions for new modes of existence, in the crafting of a procedural architecture, habit should therefore not be fully discarded. A procedural architecting must look at habitâ€™s repetitive pathways to see how they subtly diverge from what is perceived as their assigned choreography, finding within repetition the difference that keeps habit inventive. This difference, alive as it is with minor tendencies that keep habit from ever fully reproducing itself, is what procedural architectures make operative. As a world-constituting procedure, procedural architecture works from these minor tendencies to extend experience to its full potential.
