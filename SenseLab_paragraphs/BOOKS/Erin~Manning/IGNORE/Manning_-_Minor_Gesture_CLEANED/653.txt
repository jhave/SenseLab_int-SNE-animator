This is the work of a politics of affirmation: to create the conditions for another way of saying yes!, for another kind of appeal. This yes! is not the donkey’s bray, it is not the victim’s burden. This yes! is a form of listening that also hears the untimely noises of what cannot be contained in the words that describe the event. It is the yes! of the fugitive public, that which runs “through the public and the private, the state and the economy,” a public “of strangers not communities, of undercommons not neighborhoods, among those who have been there all along from somewhere” (Moten and Harney 2013: 63).
