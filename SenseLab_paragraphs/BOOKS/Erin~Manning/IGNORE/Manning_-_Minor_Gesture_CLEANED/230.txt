Initially conceived as a way to open the Folds to Infinity collection to a more volumetric composition (the fabrics used in Folds to Infinity are diaphanous and smaller and tend to be used in superposition), Volumetrics was exhibited in its first iteration as a complement to Folds to Infinity. What I soon found, however, was that Volumetrics was incapable of doing the complex work I had come to expect from the Folds to Infinity collection. In the context of a participatory proposition, Folds to Infinity, in both its iterations as Slow Clothes and Stitching Time, was easily approachable, mostly due, I think, to its brilliant color, enticing fabrics, and beautiful buttons. All kinds of people gravitated toward it and generally seemed open to exploration, either creating garments or moving the fabric to activate the architecture of the environment. This participation was also activated perceptually through the field effect created by color and light, an effect that made felt the shifting affective tonality of the environment. This emboldened the work to become a choreographic object: with participation, both perceptual and physical, the work became capable, in several of its iterations, of tuning movement to shifting spacetimes of composition.7 Becoming choreographic, the work was capable of making felt its own art of participation, its transindividual share, while co-composing with actual participants in the space.
