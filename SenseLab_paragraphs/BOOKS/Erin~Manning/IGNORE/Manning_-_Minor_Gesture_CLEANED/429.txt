The feeling of effort can perhaps assist us in understanding this play, in the terminus, between agencement and aim. James begins “The Feeling of Effort” by asking where effort comes from in the movement act. Is the effort situated in the body? Can it be consciously aligned to a muscle? Does the effort “come from us”? Or must we think the feeling of effort of a movement more in alignment with the notion of “the effort to remember, . . . the effort to make a decision, or to attend to a disagreeable task” (1969: 154)?
