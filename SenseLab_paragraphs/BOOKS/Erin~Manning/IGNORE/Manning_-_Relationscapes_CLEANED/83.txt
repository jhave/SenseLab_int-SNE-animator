If we had to locate creativity, the interval could serve as its nexus. I cannot show you how to move my movement, but I can show you how to potentialize the interval to help extend your movement to its qualitative limit. This is what Forsythe means when he says that he must work with the dancers to help them find their movement. To find movement is to work with preacceleration. This just-before is also a way to think duration rather than succumbing to linear time. It is not that I will know the movement in a potential future, but that I will invent the now in a time-slip I will come to know as the just-before. This just-before will never be about an individual movement, but about the relation between preacceleration and motion, between an infinity of intervals apprehended in the not-yet of our quantitative displacement. “When you’re actually dancing, it is seldom that the principles occur in isolation” (Forsythe 2003, 18).
