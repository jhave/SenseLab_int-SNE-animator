Intuition is the connecting thread. For Bergson, intuition is a mode of knowledge that distances itself from measure, asking not how something can be divided but how it can be experienced. Intuition relates one concept to another, finding threads, for example, between the becoming-movement of relational movement and the becoming-image of Marey’s chronophotography, seeking not to tie them together but to intensively connect them in their capacity to open thought. Openings of thought create movements of thought. Marey’s opaque transparencies move with perception. From imposed curves to immanent curvature, perception becomes elastic, and the image becomes graceful. Virtually present, grace makes perceptible the preacceleration inherent in all movement. The grace of Marey’s images is their capacity to make the interval felt. We feel the preacceleration through which movement takes form. We feel elasticity even though we cannot see it as such. We experience the imperceptible.
