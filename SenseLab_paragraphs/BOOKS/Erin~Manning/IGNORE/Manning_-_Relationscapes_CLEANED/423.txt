Commanding form is how the virtuality of a work connects to the manner in which a work reiteratively takes form.82 In music, it refers to what sustains a work in the repetition of its playings. When we experience Riefenstahl’s work, it is important to ask how it takes form today, how its reiteration over more than a half century sustains itself, how the shape-taking and the form-finding of her images continue to resonate. A work’s commanding form is not associated to a moral imperative. Riefenstahl’s images will never be disconnected from fascism. The point is not to attempt to do so but to evolve with them to connect to the force of their physicality within the transcendence her work forecasts.
