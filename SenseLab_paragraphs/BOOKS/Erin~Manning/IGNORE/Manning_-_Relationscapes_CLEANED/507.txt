The fourth panel is violent in its explosion of energy. The whole body—a whole lot—feels emergent here, animating the painting’s diagram, culminating in the last canvas. Red against white against the brownish-green mix of background-becoming-foreground, the lines are wild, creating incipient topological forms on a surface that resists flatness. The fifth panel seems again more composed—more restful, the lines continuous up, down, and across, mostly white with a bit of red creating a sense of an emergent pink, a drawing across of shade that moves toward affective tone rather than simply color, for pink seems anathema to the ferocity of these active lines. In the last panel, the paint begins to run out, as though we were left with the dregs of the effort that constitutes the event of the series.
