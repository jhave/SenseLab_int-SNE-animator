For “Housing the Body—Dressing the Environment,” we attempted to shape the intensity of our collaboration by sending an open call for “platforms for relation,” relational techniques proposed and carried out by teams of participants who had either already participated in “Dancing the Virtual” or who would become new members of the series of events. “Housing the Body—Dressing the Environment” built on the concerns outlined for “Dancing the Virtual.” It was dedicated specifically to a collective exploration of the dynamic cross-genesis of the body and its constructed environment, where the environment is taken to include not only the architectural surround but also technological and cultural extensions of it. From selected platforms, we developed skeletal structures for relational improvisation through sound, skin, textiles, movement, architecture, and new media. These platforms were conceived as pragmatic points of departure for thinking/doing throughout the event. The way they took form throughout “Housing the Body—Dressing the Environment” made apparent the force of well-designed creative techniques to further the thinking of doing and the doing of thought.
