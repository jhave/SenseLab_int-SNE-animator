When causal efficacy is missing, as it seems to be with post-encephalitic patients, there’s nowhere to go but still. It is impossible to gear into activation without the causal relations that make space-time tangible. Sacks’s patients are overwhelmed by an undifferentiated otherworldliness that takes in the complex qualities of experience without being able to connect them to oneanother—otherworldly, because the frozen state occludes the very concept of worlding. With L-dopa, the perceptual experience of causal efficacy suddenly seems available, and displacement becomes possible. Neurologically, L-dopa seems to return to the patients this lost ability to field relation. But without first being “awakened,” this capacity of Sacks’s patients to activate relation is limited to the infinitely nuanced but, for them, infuriatingly timeless experience of what Whitehead calls presentational immediacy, the state where perception is ensconced in the perception of perception.
