Conjunctive potential mixed with sense experience makes every perception an event.
“Awake,” post-encephalitic patients are clearly within the complex realm of symbolic reference. This is demonstrated through the patients’ capacity not only to articulate the astonishing aspects of their various states but also to invent ingenious techniques to bring causal efficacy into presentational immediacy such that they can continue to benefit from symbolic reference. Frances D. describes one such technique. She explains that even on L-dopa, she has a tendency to refreeze in certain spaces, such as the long corridor of the hospital. To de-freeze herself,35 she carries a supply of small paper balls. As she feels herself begin to slip into inactivation, she drops a ball. The ball has a double function: it striates the long, otherwise “smooth” corridor, bringing the corridor into the space-time of relation that permits her to take the next step, and it allows her to keep moving in the awakeness of the reacquired state of symbolic reference. One ball can act on more than one step.
