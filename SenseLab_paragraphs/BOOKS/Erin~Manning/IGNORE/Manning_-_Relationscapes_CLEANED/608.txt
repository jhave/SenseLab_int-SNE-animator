Thought in motion intensifies patterns of force, some edited in as concepts in the making, some left by the wayside for future thinkings. Francis Bacon refers to patterns of force as diagrams. Diagrams cannot be defined as such; they are felt only in their effects. They virtually resonate, recomposing sensation, collecting the intensity of rhythm and propelling it toward a becoming-work of the work. Bacon speaks of diagrams as “orders of sensation,” “levels of feeling,” each of them conceived as different orders of a singular block of sensation.
