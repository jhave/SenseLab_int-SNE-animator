In 2005, with members of the Sense Lab2 and the Workshop in Radical Em- piricism,3 Brian Massumi and I started thinking about how we might envision a collaborative event that would create a movement of thought. For over a year, we considered what constitutes an event and how techniques of creation cre- ate concepts-in-the-making. In May 2006, the Sense Lab hosted “Dancing the Virtual,” the first of four events scheduled to take place over a four-year period under the larger rubric of Technologies of Lived Abstraction.4
“Dancing the Virtual” was conceived as a challenge to the often upheld di- chotomy between creation and thought/ research. The specific aim of “Danc- ing the Virtual” was to produce a platform for speculative pragmatism where what begins technically as a movement is immediately a movement of thought. In the active passage between movement and movements of thought, the par- ticipants of “Dancing the Virtual” collaboratively began to build a repertoire of new techniques for experimentation that performatively bridge the gap
