As it enters into movement, the ground is reconstituted as novelty, intertwining with the capacities of what a gravitational body can do. The ground is one of movementâ€™s enabling constraints: the dancer will always reach the ground again. Yet in the series dancer-movement-ground, it is how the ground plays into movement moving that is at stake. Grounding need not be a strictly vertical proposition: with the inflections of movement moving, ground can become a vorticality, a horizontality. Actively prehended, the ground moves (with) the dance.
