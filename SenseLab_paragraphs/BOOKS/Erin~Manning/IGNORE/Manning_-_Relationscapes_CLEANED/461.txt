Deleuze writes: “We do not listen closely enough to what painters have to say. They say that the painter is already in the canvas, where he or she encounters all the figurative and probabilistic givens that occupy and preoccupy the canvas” (2003, 81). We look-with its diagram, the resonant force lines it calls forth. Mina Mina’s diagram comes together through the dotted black line on the upper right side of the canvas, a line that almost cuts off the corner from the rest, yet embraces the painting as a whole. This self-embracing gesture is more than a compositional device. It expresses the painting’s withness, its immanent force. It creates a tensile elasticity that holds the experience of touching vision to the singularity of its own eventness.
