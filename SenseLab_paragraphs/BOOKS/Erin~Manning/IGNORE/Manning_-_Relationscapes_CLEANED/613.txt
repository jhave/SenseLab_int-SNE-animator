Amanda Baggs’s orchestral expression of the series object-sound-gesture is strangely reminiscent of Lygia Clark’s relational objects.123 Clark’s relational objects create worlds: this is how their value is felt. These objects—plastic bags filled with breath, nets with stones in them—are of little artistic value in and of themselves. The value of Clark’s relational objects is not expressed in their capacity to stand alone as objects. It is felt in the emergent qualities their coupling with bodies in relation brings forth. Their value lies in how the forces of potential express themselves in their relational movement toward the world. As with the “how” of the gesture-object-sound composition of Baggs’s emergent musical environment, Clark’s relational objects produce events in the making that are defined by the constraints of their pairings. These constraints are the limits borne out of the environment that incite the ways in which complex series can conjunctively take form.
