3. Kathleen Petyarre’s Arnkerrthe (2001) speaks to the movements of a mountain devil lizard. But this square painting, asymmetrically symmetrical, also does much more than that. One meter twenty squared is a forceful enclosure for a becoming-movement. Squares often call forth diagrams that conform to their limits. Petyarre resists these limitations, creating a becoming-body of movement-across that subtly emerges on the right quadrant, shading down through the otherwise almost-straight lines. There is a shadow here, a passage not yet quite actualized, that challenges the structure, bringing a fragility to its inner limits. On the lower left hand quadrant, the line thickens and there is a sense of reaching-toward a tremulous center point. This point is not fixed: it is a pulsation that envelops the whole painting. A meeting point, rather than a vanishing point. This point is what Deleuze would call haptic, evolving from a line to a touch distinct from its purely optical function. The mountain devil lizard’s passage is not one simply to be followed. It must be lived via a politics of touch that remains a reaching-toward. This reaching-toward scrambles the painting’s parameters, shifting the constraint from the square to the triangle, from the triangle to the parallel line, from the parallel line to the shadow, to the speed of the dots, to their fragile merging into new space-times of experience. Passages already traveled, actualized in their transformations, alongside passages set as markers for future explorations. The movement is squared with a difference, a differential becoming-elastic moving across the formation, a becoming-form barely visible yet felt. If this is a map, it is not a topography. Its diagram is the process active between directional tendencies and their textures. Its diagram is the evolution of a shadow of quasi perceptibility that moves-with, its lizarding creating relational matrices, circles in the square.
