Eternal objects give taking-form its resonance. When an occasion culminates its process, it perishes. How a perished event can be regathered into experience depends on the ways in which its qualities extend into the future-passing of felt experience (via non-sensuous perception). Were perishing the absolute end of the occasion, there would be no futurity to an event, no becoming across experience. Whitehead’s actual occasions are not closed in on themselves as are Leibniz’s monads. Through the ingression of eternal objects, actual occasions remain virtually open to qualitative resonances across the nexus of becoming. Eternal objects continue to color events in the making even across their perishings, subtly altering how future events emerge. The perished occasion’s fluidity of curvature is apparent in the ways in which it continues to provoke new kinds of individuation.
