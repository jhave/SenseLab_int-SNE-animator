“Being composed of a plurality of irreducible forces, the body is a multiple phenomenon” (Deleuze 1993, 40). Active and reactive forces fight for dominion in the becoming-body. The imposition onto language of a preconstituted notion of articulation threatens to make language passive. To denude language of its affective tonality is to suggest that language only makes sense through the syntax of words.
