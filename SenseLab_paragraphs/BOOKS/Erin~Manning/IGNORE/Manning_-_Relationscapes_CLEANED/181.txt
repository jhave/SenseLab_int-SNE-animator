Take the case of Hester Y. At the age of thirty, Hester began to feel the effects of post-encephalitis lethargica syndrome. At first, Hester experienced a simple loss of flow: “She would be walking or talking with a normal pattern and flow, and then suddenly, without warning, would come to a stop—in mid-stride, midgesture, or the middle of a word; after a few seconds she would resume speech and movement, apparently unaware that any interruption had occurred” (Sacks 1990, 95). Because of the progressive nature of the disease, soon Hester could no longer auto-resume the flow. Then for decades Hester was immobilized with a blank and vacuous expression on her face.
What Oliver Sacks found when he started to work with Hester and others suffering from post-encephalitic syndrome at Mount Carmel hospital in 1965 was that these patients could in fact move. They just couldn’t do it by themselves. To move, they had to be activated. One of Sack’s hypotheses was that he was dealing with an acute kind of Parkinsonism, whereby the usual symptomatic “shaking” was translated into immobility. It was as though the shaking had become so severe as to result in a total freezing of the body. The encephalitis lethargica patients’ need to be activated by “outside” stimuli suggested to Sacks that autoactivation had been damaged by the neurological disease as it often is in Parkinsonian patients, albeit on a lesser scale.
