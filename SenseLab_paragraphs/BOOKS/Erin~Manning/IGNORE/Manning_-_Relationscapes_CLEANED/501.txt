To speak of Kngwarreyeâ€™s work in this way only begins to get at the richness of the experience vividly and brilliantly created through her work. What is at stake for Kngwarreye shifts far beyond representation, beyond the figural toward an abstraction that embraces the passage of the actual into the virtual, an abstraction that radically recasts the figure in an attempt to undermine the idea that Dreamings contain experience. Kngwarreye painted with and across Dreamings, never content to give in to the idea that they should represent anything beyond experience in the making. A whole lot.
