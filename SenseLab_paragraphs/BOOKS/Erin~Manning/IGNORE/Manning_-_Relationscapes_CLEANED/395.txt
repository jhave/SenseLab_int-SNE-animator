The conjunctive force out of which a body is created is a biogram because of the ways in which it transforms what a body can do. Biograms work on the becoming-body. The biogram must not be thought as an image of the body. It is always deterritorialized. It holds nothing. It is a principle of conjugation, of consistency. It creates a texture before it coagulates into form. Better to say that the becoming-body “biograms.” To biogram is to create a virtual resonance that expresses the conjunction between series that prolong what a body can do. Not what movement is, but what movement can do.
