The event created by relational movement is not only concerned with two dancers. An occasion of experience always carries the many in the one. The modes of functioning that make the experience palpable jointly constitute its process of becoming. These modes can never be separated out from the worlding of the event: each event contains the world within it. This means that each movement-event is invested with all of the currents of worldness that have made that singular movement possible. Worldness is the future-past (the intensive background) out of which all movements-with compose. The relationality of relational movement moves the world as much as the world moves through it.
