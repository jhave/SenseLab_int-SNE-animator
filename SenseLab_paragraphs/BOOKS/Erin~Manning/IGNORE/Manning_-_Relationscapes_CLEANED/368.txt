In traditional ballet the coupling often feels choreographed and standardized. What McLaren achieves in Pas de deux is the transduction of the coupling into the force of individuation taking form through the quality of movement tracing its future-anteriority. This individuation is not the taking-form of a single individual. It is the essence of movement felt as the becoming-body of dance.
