We take a step. My step leads me forward, but before I can step I must call on you to move almost before my own displacement. It is this almost-before I must communicate. This silent question takes the form of an opening. Technically: the energy that is preaccelerating through my body convenes in a direction that can be harnessed. The direction becomes a potential movement that repositions an almost-shifting body in a towardness that has not yet actually moved. The towardness draws you in. What they see: we move forward togetherâ€”I step forward, she steps back. It looks seamless. Result: they think this must be choreographed.
