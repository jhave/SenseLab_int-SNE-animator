Étienne-Jules Marey (1830–1904) spent his life inventing machines to measure the imperceptible.61 He began this exploration of perception in the late 1850s with graph-writing instruments. These machines were concerned with measuring the body’s inner movements, calculating, for instance, the almost-invisible movements of the pulse’s rhythms and the blood’s flow by tracing them onto the surfaces of smoke-blackened cylinders. Over his research career, he developed many such experimental machines ranging from inscription instruments to photographic apparatuses.
