The question is: what activates perception in such a way that it incites us to take the next step? Whitehead has an answer. He believes that what activates our capacity to world is causal efficacy as completed through what he calls symbolic reference.33 Causal efficacy is the stage of perception that refers to the immanent relationality of all experience. When Hester talks about her sense of there being no space-time in her frozen state, she is referring to a lack of the immediacy of relation. The motivation for taking the next step is relation: there has to be a force toward which to connect. This force is not a decision in the sense of an individual wanting to move. It is a relational encounter with the immediacy of pastness working in the present. To move is to move-with the experience of movement moving. It is to feel-with the incipiency of preacceleration.
