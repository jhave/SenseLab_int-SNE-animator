The corpuscular society that is the nexus of actual occasions is infinitely porous, each actual occasion a world fluid with the potential for relational deviation. This potential for deviatory foldings is the actual occasionâ€™s futurity. It is the way in which the occasion continues to resonate even after it has reached its satisfaction and become, for all eternity, what it will have been. The event has taken form and yet its form-taking folds with eternal objects that continue to populate the universe, not as objects, but as more folds, as elastic nodes in the process of becoming.
