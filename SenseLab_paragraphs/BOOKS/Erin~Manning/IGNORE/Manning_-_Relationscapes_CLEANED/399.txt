Futurism’s echoes populate the beginnings of cinema and resonate in Leni Riefenstahl’s work. Boccioni and Riefenstahl both explore how a wholeness of movement (movement as indivisible) challenges the idea of preexistent space. This is a Bergsonian problem: how to think of space as not preexistent without spatializing the potential emptiness of time’s passing. For Bergson, the problem is that if space preexists movement—if space is the container for movement— then movement must be seen as coming in and out of existence. This would mean that discrete movements of time are connected through a process of spatialization. In the vocabulary of the cinematic, this would translate to movement operating only at the cut where one image meets another on the spatializing frame of the celluloid.
For Bergson movement is distinct from space covered. Space covered is divisible whilst movement is indivisible. While neither Bergson nor Boccioni extrapolated their theses on movement toward the cinematic, it seems that Riefenstahl takes up their challenge, creating a durational vocabulary of movement for the cinematic that far exceeds Bergson’s ideas about the potential of cinema. Riefenstahl’s films make clear that cinematic movement does not only operate at the cut, or at the frame, but makes itself felt in and through audio-visual series.
