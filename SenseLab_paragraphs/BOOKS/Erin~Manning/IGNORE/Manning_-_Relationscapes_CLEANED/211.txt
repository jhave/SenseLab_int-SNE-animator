“Symbolically conditioned action is action which is . . . conditioned by the analysis of the perceptive mode of causal efficacy effected by symbolic transference from the perceptive mode of presentational immediacy” (Whitehead 1927, 80). To perceive is not simply to get to know the world but to activate it and to field it, in one and the same motion. If all we have is presentational immediacy, we are stuck with a portion of presented duration with which nothing can be done. We sense to sense to sense. There is nowhere to go, nothing to do. “The conscious analysis of perception is primarily concerned with the analysis of the symbolic relationship between the two perceptive modes” (Whitehead 1927, 81). When nothing new can be thought, negative knowings abound. Rose explains, “I think a thought and it’s suddenly gone—like having a picture whipped out of its frame. . . . I have a particular idea, but can’t keep it in mind; and then I lose the general idea, and then the general idea of general idea; and in two or three jumps my mind is blank—all my thoughts are gone, blanked out or erased” (qtd. in Sacks 1990, 76n54).
