The tweaking of systems to create experiential evolution that informs methodological processes is a form of radical empiricism. It creates novelty out of relational matrices. This “adaptation-concretization is a process which conditions the birth of a milieu that, instead of already being conditioned by another already-given milieu, is conditioned by a milieu that exists but virtually before the invention” (Simondon 1969, 55; my translation). Invention is not simply the creation of a new machine to better capture movement in space but a jump to a different register whereby the machine begins to operate ontogenetically. More than a sum of its measuring parts, the machine generates potential, registering not simply data on movement but ontogenetically adding to itself such that it is always intrinsically in the process of reinventing what a machine— or a technique—can do. “We could say that concretizing invention creates a techno-geographic milieu . . . that is a condition of possibility for the functioning of the technical object” (Simondon 1969, 55; my translation). Marey’s technical objects are co-constitutive of experimental process. They create an associated milieu of body-movement-machine whereby new conditions for experimentation are invented.
