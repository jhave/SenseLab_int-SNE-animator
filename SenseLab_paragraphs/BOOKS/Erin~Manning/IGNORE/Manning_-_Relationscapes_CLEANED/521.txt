Relationscapes abound. They are not strictly relegated to the Aborigines and their experience of the Dreaming. Kngwarreye was not the first to annihilate figuration. What art such as that of Kngwarreye, Napangardi, Petyarre, or Possum does is create a movement of thought, a movement that is marayin, at once painting, song, dance, sacred object, and power word. Through their work, we move toward a topological hyperspace of experience, asking once again how emptiness is configured, how topologies extend our worlds, rhythmically (de) forming them, and how maps that sense-across create durations that eventfully alter how experience can unfold.
