This acting of force on force that can be felt in Napangardi’s work is a returning of the return, an eternal spiralling movement that makes the cycle of time felt. What is felt through this evocation of the Dreaming is time’s intensive magnitude—its chthonic movement—and its infinite cycle of return. This is not incessant sameness—it is differential becoming, force acting on force to affirm difference at every turn. “Existence begins in every instant; the ball There rolls around every Here. The middle is everywhere. The path of eternity is crooked” (Nietzsche 1961, 234).
