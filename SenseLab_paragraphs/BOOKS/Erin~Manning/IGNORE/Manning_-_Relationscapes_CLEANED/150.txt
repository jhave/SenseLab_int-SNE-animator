Perishing is inevitable. Events are only events because they perish. It is their perishing that culminates their potential. The perishing is not the end: it propels
the preacceleration of a new occasion of experience. Once the subjective form composes itself, the experience has been constituted, and the event is nearing its completion. It has done its work. To feel the elasticity is always to know we are on the edge. When the elastic contracts, we feel at once the perishing of the event and the propulsion of the next preacceleration. This is because the elastic force is as present in its stretching as in its contraction, always stimulating the intensive spiral of a new becoming-movement.
