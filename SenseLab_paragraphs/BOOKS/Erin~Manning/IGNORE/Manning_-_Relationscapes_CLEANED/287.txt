Despite his desire to secure results for publication in scientific journals in the name of the advancement of knowledge—something his early graph-writing machines allowed him to do with processes such as measuring the pulse—he quite soon found himself ensconced in a universe of movement for which there was no adequate source of measure. As the movement experiments focused more on the processual (especially those of gases, but also his experiments with locomotion), he began, despite himself, to delve into the exploration of incipiency, graphing not only curves of movement but curves in movement. These curves are a radical change in Marey’s approach in the sense that they cease to work solely as representations of movement-passed and become fascinated with movement-passing. By the end of his life, although still committed to measuring movement in quantitative scientific terms, what stands out in his work are photographic images of experiential flows, elastic forces, quasi-virtual perceptions not of the movement as content but of the incorporeal surfacing of the microperceptual.
