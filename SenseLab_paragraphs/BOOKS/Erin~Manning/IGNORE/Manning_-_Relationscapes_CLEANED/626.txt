Concrescence brings finality to an event, pulling it into its subjective form. This is not the end of eventness, only the end of that particular iteration. In My Language is like a resonant chamber for thought, its movement felt through an infinite expressivity of appetition for complex relation. Its concrescence gives another facet to a process that will continue to develop as new relays are invented in the watching. Thought felt is feeling in motion, a divisible indivisibility on its way to final form. Thinking feeling creates an appetite for experimentation.
