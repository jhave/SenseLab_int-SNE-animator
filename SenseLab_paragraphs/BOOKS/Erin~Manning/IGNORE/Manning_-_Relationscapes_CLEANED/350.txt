We feel the elasticity of perception. We feel the nuance, the n-dimensionality of the elastic that propels the experience toward the very unknowability of future sensations. Agitations, excitations, contractions are felt in the feeling of force taking form. To look at Marey’s images is to feel the microperceptual: the perceptibility of the almost.
The elasticity of the almost that is felt so palpably in relational movement as two bodies dance together reemerges here as an activating trace of what perception can do. Perception and representation are no longer a sustainable dichotomy: they are different rhythms of a singular event of relation. What moves as a relation in relational movement moves as a perception in Marey’s images.
