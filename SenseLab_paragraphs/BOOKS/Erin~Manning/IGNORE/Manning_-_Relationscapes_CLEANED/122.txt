She feels the preacceleration of my movement even before I move, responding by taking a step back around me, across the front of my body. As she steps across, the velocity of a spiral feeds the becoming-movement such that we participate in a centrifugal force. With her body in my arms, moving across yet still in front, I take a small step forward, which completes the incipient spiral. This spiral is intensiveâ€”it does not move away, it moves-with. Moving-with, our bodies spin together, turning on a shared axis that emerges out of the movement itself. Grace in the making.
