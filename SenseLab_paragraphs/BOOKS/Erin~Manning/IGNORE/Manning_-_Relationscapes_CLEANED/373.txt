Olympia Part 1, Festival of the People (Riefenstahl 1938), opens with the credits etched into rock. As the credits give way to the first image, the frieze comes to life. Bodies in stone become bodies in motion, emerging in a slow dance as the camera circles the ruins of what looks like an early Olympic site. This slow dance of the camera is accompanied by a sense of rock coming to life. We perceive a double, even triple movement: the music plays the atmosphere that transforms the ruins into mutating forms that give way to a moody sky. The sky is a protagonist: it awakens slowly, the sun languidly piercing through the image’s opacity. In tandem with this gradual transformation from dawn to day, the camera movements create a mood of metamorphosis. By the time we reach the structure of the Parthenon a few minutes into the film, a mood of lingering transformation has been etched into the landscape’s permutations. We have been led along the uncanny passage of transfiguration. In the opening of Olympia, Riefenstahl does not simply show us a field of ruins. She brings it to life.
