To sense — to experience the world amodally — is a key way to activate the body’s relation to the world and open the body to its technogenetic potential. This already occurs in the dancing body when the movement causes the room to space differently through an accumulation of tactile sensations coursing through the air. Felt affectively as a change in the dynamics of the emergent environment, this kind of experiential space-time takes form with and through the dancer’s body as a molecular reorganization of duration such that the dimensions of the felt are re-experienced in conjunction with the reassembling of a dispersing, recognizing becoming-body.
