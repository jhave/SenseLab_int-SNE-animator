Aboriginal culture works on nonlinear timelines. The past infects the present in its future re-activation, alive in the present not as past but as present-taking-form. Time dances into itself rich with past experience reanimated. Moving-with time, Dreamings reinvent an always-changing landscape that becomes alongside a changing culture. This is why Napangardi can continue to paint Mina Mina despite having returned only infrequently since she was brought to an outstation in her young childhood.113 The Dreaming here becomes a technique for the remaking of moving time, enabling her to reinvent with the complex intermixing of memory, oral history, and dreams. Napangardi’s art invents-with the landscape of her culture remaking itself, regardless of the contradictions of her current living situation, which is in many ways very distanced from her people’s long nomadic history. This reinventing of culture through a recasting of experience-in-the-making flows similarly to Ngayurru, a lakebed at Mina Mina of hard-packed clay with criss-crossed salt-lines “like an intricate pattern of interwoven string,” which undergoes a complete transformation on those rare occasions when it is filled with water, “teeming with seagulls, black swans, and kestrels” (Nungarrayi 2002, 8).
