In most organisms, to causally prehend is only one aspect of perception.51 The second phase is called presentational immediacy. In this second phase (though never quite second, since in higher organisms it is experienced in tandem with causal efficacy), perception is enhanced by the quality of experience. Whereas with causal efficacy we perceive the relation enclosure-safety upon entering a room, with presentational immediacy the color of the room emerges, a quality, strictly speaking, unnecessary to the experience of feeling safe, yet that subtly alters “safety’s” affective tonality.
As demonstrated in chapter 3, presentational immediacy is lost without causal efficacy: despite the heterogeneity of its experiential dimensions, “pure” presentational immediacy cannot comprehend or delineate an event. Qualitative difference must be associated with causal efficacy’s capacity to create a relation between event and world. Pastness is necessary for perception, even if that pastness does nothing but invite the creation of an object-world relation to be deformed in the next prehension. Novelty emerges from the productive constraints of the pastness of worldings in the present-passing. Presentational immediacy is what adds nuance to the mix. Without presentational immediacy, the world loses nuance. As with the intertwining of appearance and reality, what we know as perception is similarly a complex intermixing of causal efficacy and presentational immediacy.
