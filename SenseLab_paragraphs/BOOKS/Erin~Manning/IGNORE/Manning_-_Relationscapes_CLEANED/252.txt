The sensing body in movement also feels time. This feeling of time happens through the activation of past movements in the present. Whitehead calls the direct perception of pastness non-sensuous perception. Non-sensuous perception underscores the fact that perception begins relationally with an emphasis on the pastness that allows us to feel the world in the future-present. This pastness (which can be durationally as immediate as the present moment passing) enables the formation of causal relations between past events and current circumstances such that we feel the world ecologically before we know exactly what it is. To feel ecologically is to directly perceive the relations out of which space-time is composed. Perceiving ecologically does not imply giving meaning to form, but forming environmentally. To say we perceive non-sensuously—or ecologically—is to emphasize how the world creates modalities of perception even as modalities of perception world. Ecological durations are not linear— they are richly layered, their nexus ripe with reality, their actual environments populated by appearances.
