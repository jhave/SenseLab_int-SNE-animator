Salt on Mina Mina has calm corners, each of them lined with dots of approximately the same consistency. The frame is quiet, as is the intensive middle, a whiteness of dots vibrating. It is what happens in the toward of the dots’ movements that is forceful, not their placing on the canvas as such. This resonance can already be felt in the space between the lines around the edges of the canvas, in the incipiency of the undulating lines moving toward the center. The incipiency felt here as the force of movement taking form is created by the intervals between the dots that foreground the sonorous beat of the background becoming foreground. What we see are not actually lines but the spaces between the dots, in-filled with intensity as movement pushes to the fore. The line becomes an intensity of vibratory movement—an actual image of an incipiency. The line quivers with movement, still and active at once. We feel movement’s intensity, not its displacement.
