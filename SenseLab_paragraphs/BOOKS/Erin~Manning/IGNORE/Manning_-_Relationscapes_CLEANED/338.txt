The first machines were quite simple: Marey placed a small sensing apparatus on the edge of each wing that measured the bird’s flight. This apparatus’s function was to graphically measure each received movement. With a thin cable attached to each wing, the graphic machine and the bird were able to communicate. Measuring frequency of wing movement in flight, Marey discovered that “the duration of the lowering of the wing is generally longer than that of its elevation” (Mannoni 2004, 18). As he had presumed (against all scientific speculation at the time), the movement of the bird’s wings was not directly regulated by the musculature—it was in fact intrinsically dependent on the resistance of the air acting on the wing. This discovery would have consequences in the field of aviation. But not before Marey stopped attaching birds to machines! As can be surmised, creating the conditions for measuring movement was quite a challenge as long as the bird continued to be restricted to a predetermined circuit. This was the impetus for his later move toward chronophotography, a practice that would allow Marey to develop a sense of the bird’s movements that was more closely linked to its actual tendencies in flight.
