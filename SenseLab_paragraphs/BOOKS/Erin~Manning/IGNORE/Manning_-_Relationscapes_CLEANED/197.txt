Causal efficacy activates the how of experience. It is non-sensuous in that it builds on pastness: it is “heavy with the contact of the things gone by, which lay their grip on our immediate selves” (Whitehead 1927, 44). This experience of pastness folds into a relational presentness that gives experience the breadth that opens it to activation. Through causal efficacy, we immediately feel our connectedness to the world in its present appearance. This explains why, for most of us, taking the next step is not an issue. We know the ground is there: we trust our capacity to gauge space. We walk easily with the implicit knowledge of the intrinsic relation between body, ground, and space-time. We move through movement moving. The pastness of experience has taught us how to feel the approach of a wall, to immediately know whether there is room to continue moving. We don’t have to consider where the ground is. We feel the cliff ’s edge coming into appearance. We intuitively know how to field space-time because space-time appears to us as a fold of relation. This fold makes sense to us: we find our movement through it. This does not mean that we don’t make mistakes— sometimes our sense of space skews, and we walk into a mirror, or we miss a step and fall, or we trip over a wrinkle in the carpet. But generally, causal efficacy provides us with an immediate sense of how things go together.
