Riefenstahl creates the becoming-body of the second series out of a transduction of consistency into shape, grass + arms. Hers is the creation of a dance transcendent and yet immanently material. Throughout, this immanent materiality is foregrounded, a materiality that takes form as a body-becoming. This body-becoming evokes a physical transcendentalism—physical in its materiality, transcendental in its immanence. What dances is not the body as such but the between of the series, its interval. This interval — what I will call a biogram – shapes the form of Riefenstahl’s work.
