2. Emily Kame Kngwarreye’s Alhalkere (1991) covers the whole wall. Three meters wide, it is powerful in its vivid evocation of the land, dancing with both grace and force. Asignifying traits merge to create a non-representational, nonillustrative, and non-narrative field: “marks that no longer depend on our will or our sight” (Deleuze 2003, 82) Its diagram can be felt emerging from the deep reddish burgundy spilling from the top left-hand corner of the painting. It is as though the rest of the painting overflows from this dark corner, merging into a transformative activity of dot-painting, overpowered, finally, by yellow dots that transfuse with the surface, becoming surface, dense and airy at once. This quality of yellowness becomes the asignifying trait that propulses the canvas into an event. The event of Alhalkere is rhythmical: it moves in contrapuntal bursts that oscillate between red and yellow, creating a quivering of perception that dances the passage from the dot to the surface to the rhythm in between. Diagrams are “a chaos, a catastrophe, but . . . also, a germ of rhythm in relation to a new order of the painting [that] . . . unlocks areas of sensation” (Deleuze 2003, 83).
