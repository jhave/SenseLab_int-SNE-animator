The plane of composition through which articulation eventually emerges is populated by the thought of the work, its inner rhythm. Deleuze and Guattari call this inner rhythm a “block of sensation.” “We paint, sculpt, compose, and write with sensations” (1994, 166). Blocks of sensation are forces that compose thought’s durational attitude. To edit from within is to compose with the morethan of language’s actual articulation. It is to work with language’s prearticulated virtual force, directing enunciation such that its virtual effects are felt within actual expression.
