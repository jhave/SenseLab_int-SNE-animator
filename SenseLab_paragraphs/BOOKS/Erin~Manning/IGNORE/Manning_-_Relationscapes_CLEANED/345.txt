Open images produce open systems: Marey’s process cannot be stalled. With his developing chronophotographic methods, Marey continues to create image-event after image-event, each richly textured and durationally rhythmic. Sketches of futurity emerge from the chronophotographic processes. More and more, they do not represent movement: they live it. The life of movement Marey experientially captures chronophographically is increasingly movement’s virtual passage, its momentary stoppings always elastic, its intervals intensive, felt in the transitions from preacceleration to preacceleration.
A singular written expression of Marey’s approach to incipiency and intensive duration, and with it a slight admission of his interest in aesthetics, appears late in his career. He writes: “Sometimes, this superposition of images can be used; it gives a larger intensity to the images that represent moments of lesser velocity of the object in movement” (Marey 1894/2002, 58). In contradistinction with Muybridge’s photographs that are divisive multiplicities standing still, Marey acknowledges that his images are concerned with altering durations: “The multiple co-present images—imbricated images—in a chronophotograph do not all have the same status, despite the fact that their intermittent measure, their shutter speed, stays uniform” (Didi-Huberman 2004, 239). In this brief passage, it seems as though Marey himself considers his images as potential planes of duration. They are not simply sequences but sequential machines.
