Propositions cannot be relegated to a preformed body or a stand-alone object. Baggs’s propositions do not tell us what an object can do. Nor do they tell us how to speak. Rather, they create enabling constraints for the opening of a relational process. Placing her objects in specific iterations of the word-world nexus—iterations called forth by the relations themselves—Baggs participates in a becoming-language that makes the passage from thought to articulation felt such that we can participate in its unfolding.
