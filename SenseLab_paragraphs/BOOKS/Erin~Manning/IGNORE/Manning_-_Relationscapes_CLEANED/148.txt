The elasticity of the almost brings together formed experience and pure experience,26 creating a doubled event that is always either on the verge of actualization or revirtualization, at once actual and virtual. The elastic point is pure experience in relational movement. It is an actualized event in the dance, as well as an opening to a virtual suspension. As we stretch the movement (and the movement stretches us), we know that its perishing is near, and yet we flirt with this nearness. At the elastic point we find we can linger, but on its edges the spiral perishes, and we risk falling. Lingering is the pure experience of experimenting with the almost.
