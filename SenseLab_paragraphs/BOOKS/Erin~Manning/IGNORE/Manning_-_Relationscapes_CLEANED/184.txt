But people like Hester who suffer Parkinsonian symptoms as a result of contracting encephalitis lethargica can no longer take auto-activation for granted. Activation must come from outside, usually with someone else’s assistance.32 This can occur in different ways. For example, if you throw Hester a ball, she will catch it, even when apparently “immobilized.” If you place her in front of stairs or other landscape affordances she may suddenly be able to climb. But place her in an open space and she will stay stock-still. On her own, especially where experiential space-time is “smooth,” Hester cannot move.
