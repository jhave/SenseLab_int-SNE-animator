By now it is apparent that Marey’s work provokes a tension between radical empiricism and positivist science. His images invite a seeing-feeling of how the drift between measure and duration takes hold. Although he begins with measure, the feeling of duration lingers long after the viewing. Duration is endurance in and of the present-passing. In the smoke images, it is felt at the elastic point where the object and the smoke meet, where the becoming-gas of their passage is experienced. The present-passing is not of the object: it is the affective tonality of the becoming-form of the experience. In Marey’s images, this sense of becoming is felt through the ghostly imprint the movement moving leaves on the living trace of the present-passing.
