As we move together, this curving can be felt. But only when we move the relation. When I begin by moving her, what I feel is resistance. I pull, push, trip. The movement becomes a series of steps we fall into, always a little early or a little late, our balance in disequilibrium, our mood darkening. Moving the relation moves not a person but the elasticity of relation. We move-with the togetherness of a curving that fields metastable equilibriums. This does not mean that we never lose our balance. It means that balance can no longer be thought as something to be lost or gained: there is no stable axis around which I lead her for us to “lose.” We curve together, creating a folding interval out of which pure plastic rhythms begin to take form.
