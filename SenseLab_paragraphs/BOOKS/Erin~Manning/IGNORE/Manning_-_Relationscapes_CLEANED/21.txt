Do not count upon thought to ensure the relative necessity of what it thinks. Rather, count upon the contingency of an encounter with that which forces thought to rise up and educate the absolute necessity of an act of thought or a passion to think.
—Gilles Deleuze, Difference and Repetition
Something in the world forces us to think. This something is not an object of recognition, but a fundamental encounter.
