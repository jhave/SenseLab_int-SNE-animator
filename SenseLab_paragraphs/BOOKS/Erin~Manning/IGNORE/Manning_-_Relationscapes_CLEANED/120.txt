Relational movement is always improvisational. For sustained improvisation, constraint is essential. Without the rules of walking, we could invent infinitely, but this infinity would likely be chaotic. In the chaos, the tightness of relational movement’s interval would likely be dispersed. What the constraint of the walk allows is a particular texture of a shared interval. Without the interval, the very real possibility emerges that we would walk on each other’s feet and lose the connection. To displace another body rather than moving the relation is to move-to rather than with. The essence of relational movement is the creation of a virtual node, an in-between that propels the dance, that in-forms the grace that is not strictly of the body but of the movement itself.
