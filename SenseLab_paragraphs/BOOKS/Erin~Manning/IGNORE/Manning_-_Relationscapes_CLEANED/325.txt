Multiplicities are evoked in Marey’s work both quantitatively and qualitatively. They figure as quantities-for-measure and intensities-in-process. Intensity can never be measured since to measure would immediately interrupt duration, transforming force into form. Yet in the experience of the elasticity of the almost, the virtual resonance of intensity can be felt as movement moves through an actualizing form. While the intensity of passage is not present in the final concrescence of the form, it remains part of the feeling co-arising with the constitution of that particular form-taking. Quantitative results could arguably take the co-arising of intensity and form-taking into consideration in the refashioning of subsequent experimental processes: producing quantitative results need not preclude the experiential. This is the case for Marey, whose experiments create the conditions for the quantitative to be sidetracked by the qualitative. This passage from quality to quantity introduces novelty into his experiments, inciting him to create evolving forms of inquiry. A key question emerges: can there ever be “pure” positivism, or is positivism always moved by the forces of intensive magnitude?
