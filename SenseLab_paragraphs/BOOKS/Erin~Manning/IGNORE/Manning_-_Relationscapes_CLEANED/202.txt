In the state of “awakeness” or activation, symbolic reference appears fully functional in Sack’s post-encephalitic patients. “By symbolic reference the various actualities disclosed respectively by the two modes are either identified, or are at least correlated together as interrelated elements in our environment” (Whitehead 1927, 17). Key to symbolic reference is the overlapping of perception and relation. The overlapping of perception and relation can be conceptualized as the force of habit, as long as we consider habits to be event-forming. Habits are not pure reiteration: they are repetition with a difference. Through habit, we move through movement again. This moving through movement always brings with itself a new series of relational networks.
