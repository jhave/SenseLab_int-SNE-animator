Rain at Mina Mina (2001) makes this potential for mutation within the Dreaming felt. In this painting, which is exactly the same size and shape as Salt on Mina Mina (2002), the “same” lakebed has a completely different affective tonality. Whereas Salt on Mina Mina (2002) is crisp and defined in its dotted lines and incipient trajectories, Rain at Mina Mina (2001) feels blurry, its felt-lines leaking into one another, its passages flowing to create a wide, soft intensity. These paintings, which are like mirror-images of one another, are two forms of a related fact.
