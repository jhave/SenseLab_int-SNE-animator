For Lynn, the most important factor of animate design is the “co-presence of motion and force at the moment of formal conception” (1999, 11). Animate form is not about adding force to the already-thought or to the already-executed. It involves working with the force of potential that is co-constitutive of animation’s dance. This is how McLaren works in Pas de deux. Rather than offering a filmed version of the ballet dancers’ performance of the pas de deux, he opens the force of movement moving to perception.
Pas de deux animates movement’s virtual preacceleration as it takes form. The pas de deux itself—a dance choreographed for two in which the male dancer supports the ballerina in slow movements, a dance that involves a solo for each and a final coda in which the couple dance apart and together—traditionally represents relation through the choreography of the partner’s coupling. The history of relation’s role in the pas de deux is key to McLaren’s exploration of the intensive passage from incipiency to displacement. Rather than foregrounding the representation of coupling in the dance, McLaren uses the relation between the dancers to make felt the rhythms of passage from the virtual to the actual and back. He plays with the beyond of coupling, making felt the way movement moves the relation. By the end of the film, the feeling of relation has become so intensive that the separateness of the bodies no longer stands out. The individual dancers have melted into the interval, relation itself foregrounded.
