Value is never an evaluation. For Nietzsche, “evaluations . . . are not values but ways of being, modes of existence of those who judge and evaluate, serving as principles for the values on the basis of which they judge” (Deleuze 1983, 1). To value is to make relational potential the subject of enquiry. Value is how a conjunctive series moves the relation.
