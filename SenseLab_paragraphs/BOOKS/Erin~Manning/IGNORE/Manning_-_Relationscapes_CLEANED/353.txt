1. Animation is not the art of DRAWINGS-that-move but the art of MOVEMENTSthat-are-drawn.
2. What happens between each frame is much more important than what exists on each frame.
3. Animation is therefore the art of manipulating the invisible interstices that lie between frames.
—Norman McLaren, qtd. in Pierre Hébert’s Corps, Langage, Technologie
