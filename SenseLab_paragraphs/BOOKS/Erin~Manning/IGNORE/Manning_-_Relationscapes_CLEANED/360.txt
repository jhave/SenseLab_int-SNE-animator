This dance of the line’s transformation evokes a quality in McLaren’s work that resonates with his desire to make animation dance. His focus is never on the completed image but on the ways its transformation alters the process of experience. “It’s constantly changing,” he writes of the process of animation’s dance, “You’re repeating a drawing with change and it’s the change that’s the interesting part” (qtd. in Richard 1982, 32). Drawing-with, McLaren plays with the potential for animation to become animate form.
