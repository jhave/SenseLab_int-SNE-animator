To move the interval rather than “the body” is to create space-time for politics, to open the concept of the empirical to movement, to begin to express the inframodality of the sensing body in movement. The plane of immanence is fragile, yet persistent. We can try to do away with the interval, but it always returns. Political philosophy has not made space for the interval within the vocabulary of the rational modern subject, yet the interval has nonetheless leaked into the complex iterations of pure plastic rhythm’s political becomings. In dance, the interval has never absented itself, but has recently become more visible, more palpable, through movement’s enhancement with new digital technologies. Urgently: let us move the relation. But let us not devise for it a presence that denies its virtuality, the micropolitical potential of its in-betweenness.
