The extensive continuum is virtual. It has not yet been divided into spacetime. The actual occasions that populate it, on the other hand, are firmly positioned in experiential space-time. That the Dreaming cooperates on both the virtual and the actual strata is emphasized by the Dreaming’s adherence to a non-linear cycle of time, where what returns is not “time-as-it-was” but “timeas-it-will-become.” This is a time of the future-past, a present in the making. The relationship between the forces of movement’s intensive magnitude and the extensive continuum creates space-times of experience through which the return returns. This eternal return “is not the ‘same’ or the ‘one’ which comes back. . . . Return is itself the one which ought to belong to diversity and to that which differs” (Deleuze 1983, 46). Resistant to equilibrium, the relation between actual occasions and the extensive continuum incites time to become infinite not as a straight line of measured chronology but as an intensive magnitude. Time rolls into experience even as experience creates time.
