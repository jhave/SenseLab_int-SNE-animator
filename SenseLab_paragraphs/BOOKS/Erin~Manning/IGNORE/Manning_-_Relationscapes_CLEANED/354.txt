The art of movements that are drawn is animation’s dance of the between. When animation dances, it foregrounds incipient movement rather than actual displacement. Norman McLaren works with movement’s incipience, creating techniques to animate this virtual quality of the in-between. His techniques are many, including those he invented: the pastel method, which he first used while creating Là-haut sur ces montagnes (1945), and the stereoscopic three-dimensional technique used in Around is Around (1951). Each of the techniques for animation McLaren invented or used involves making the virtual interval of movement’s preacceleration felt.
