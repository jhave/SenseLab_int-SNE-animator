In this approach, the camera pauses at the movement of the grass billowing between the stone ruins. We feel the Parthenon gaining on us before we see it. The grass catches the wind, its ephemeral movement lending affective tone to the stone surfaces. What we see is imbued with the feeling of what we cannot see: the image resounds with intensive movement. Then the ultimate appearance of the imposing remainder of a lost era: a long shot of the Parthenon in full center. The play here is between materiality and fluidity. The material is the density of the ruin, the fluidity of grace taking form in the intensive passage between appearance and disappearance.
