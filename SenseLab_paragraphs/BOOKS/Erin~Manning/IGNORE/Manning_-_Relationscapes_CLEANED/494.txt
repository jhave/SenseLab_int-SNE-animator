Clifford Possum has described his map series as land titles. The maps followed in the wake of important protests claiming Aboriginal rights to land at a time when outstations were not yet the norm, and Aborigines of different tribes were forced to live together in imposed centers. As a political statement, his maps could be seen to perform a kind of active reading of the land, using the Dreamings (as would often be done subsequently to challenge the destruction of land by mining and road building) as a way to position himself and his people within the land rights movement. But to understand this as a straight-forward reclaiming would be misleading, because it would imply that the land as such was what was at stake. Clifford Possum was not delineating landmarks on a cognitive grid. He does not own the land, nor would he claim to. What he owns is a singular relation to the land. Aboriginal understanding of land must by extension alter what is usually meant by land titles. It is not the space itself that the Aborigines are calling for through their art but the topologies of space-time the land incites in relation to Dreamings of which they remain an active part.
