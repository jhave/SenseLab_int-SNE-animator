Resonant grids are rare. Usually, grids focus the eye, calling us to attention. The grid keeps a convergence between inside and outside, ensuring a containment of the bounds of its in-formation. If a force is felt, it is felt as the outside looking in, a composition of a fixed form, not a recomposing-in-movement. Napangardi’s work undoes the grid, exposing its apparent stability to its own process of unravelling. Making a topology out of a Euclidean geometry, her work propels deformations that pull the whole body into their movement. Salt on Mina Mina’s affective tonality is one of conjunctive dissonance, a felt rhythm that invents itself in the watching. Watching/feeling Napangardi’s work is like dancing the ancestral women’s dance.
