In My Language concresces—takes final form—at the end of the first section, and then again, differently, in the second part. The first concrescence is felt as a symphony of complex inframodal relations between objects, gesture, and sound. The experiential quality of this first section of the video culminates in a resonant vibration of a relational environment that suggests that language is composed of a prearticulated worlding of concepts in the making. The second part, “My Translation,” has a different rhythm, punctuated this time with words. Here, thought is experienced as a node of expression, its concrescence not the words as such, but the relay that punctuates the gestures moving-through in tandem and yet not strictly in conjunction with the words as they emerge from the computer. Baggs creates along a series of planes, her work-world finding subjective form not in a gathering-together of these planes but in a complex conjunction of their vibrant nodes.
