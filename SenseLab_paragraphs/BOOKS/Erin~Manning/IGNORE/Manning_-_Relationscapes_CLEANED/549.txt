“What a will wants is to affirm its difference” (Deleuze 1983, 9). The will to power is the differential element of force. Through the will to power, force takes form. It does so by exercising its will not on a subject but on another will. The will to power of the Dreaming is the creation of novelty within the everlasting. Systems of Law that foreground the ontogenetic potential of the new, Dreamings are at once forces of the becoming-landscape (iterations of the landscape’s infinite potential for renewal) and forces of creation. Dreamings will life and more life. For this life to take form ontogenetically, certain facts of existence must hold. As matters of fact, the Laws that are encompassed by the Dreamings impose enabling constraints on experience that open the landscape to concrete potentials. These Laws give shape to the extensive continuum that is the virtual nexus of life’s force of becoming by constraining it into patterns of resonance. These patterns can take the form of songlines, of dances, of emergent formations within the landscape. They create a relationscape out of the landscape-animal-human series that does not seek to differentiate between the virtual and the real. Dreams are activities for the virtual fact of existence made concrete.
