Eternal objects are less objects than foldings-into. They make ingress into the actual occasion, lending the event its color. This folding is a multiplying of the singular. It folds not many parts, but many ways, to infinity. “Dividing endlessly, the parts of matter form little vortices in a maelstrom, and in these are found even more vortices, even smaller, and even more are spinning in the concave intervals of the whirls that touch one another” (Deleuze 1993, 5).
