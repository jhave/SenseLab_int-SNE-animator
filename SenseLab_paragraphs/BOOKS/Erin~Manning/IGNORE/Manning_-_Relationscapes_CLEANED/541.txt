Sandhills of Mina Mina (2002) measures 152 x 152 cm.114 It is a perfect square, and yet its movement defies the strict contours of its imposed frame. Two of the corners seem to move horizontally, and two of them seem to move across, quasi-virtual paths meeting in different areas of the canvas as resonances of mixing colors. The affective tonality of the canvas is one of mutednessâ€”it is a calm, flowing work, less jaggedly differentiated than the salt line series, and yet just as complex. Here, Napangardi composes with color, using the complementarity of the color-tones to create fields of virtual movement. As a technique in its own right, color here takes over the work of the digging sticks, creating a virtual resonance within the actual shape-shifting of the landscape. The color brings out the landscape in the work, giving consistency to a form-taking that occurs significantly where the color comes together.
