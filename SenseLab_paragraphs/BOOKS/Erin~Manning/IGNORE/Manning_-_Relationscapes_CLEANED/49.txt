This is particularly resonant in the animate form of Étienne-Jules Marey’s cinematic experiments, which seek to locate durational movement’s imperceptibility within a positivist framework and develop a vocabulary for movement that exceeds representation within a stable matrix of calculable coordinates. Although never explicitly outlined in chapter 5, I would argue that had Marey’s experiments with movement been foregrounded within the history of cinema, cinema’s early emphasis on theories of semiosis might have been derouted into a more developed exploration of how cinema moves. This might have redirected the study of cinema from its early academic embededness within formalist thought toward early twentieth-century expressions of movement such as the invention of modern dance, Futurism’s concern with ontogenesis, Bergson’s theory of duration. The effect of this convergence of cinema and movement would have been a foregrounding less of narrative strategies within the cinematic than experimentation with how images provoke durational flows that are themselves mobile even before passing through a projector.
