Intensity is anathema to quantification. It concerns the elasticity of movement. Intensity in-gathers the imperceptible toward a movement-feeling. This movement-feeling is the experience of force taking form. Bergson writes, “At first [grace] is only the perception of a certain ease, a certain facility in the outward movements. Since easy movements are the ones which prepare the way for others, we are led to find a superior ease in the movements which can be foreseen, in the present attitudes in which future attitudes are pointed out and, as it were, prefigured” (1910, 11–12; translation modified). What we experience as grace is an emergence of future ease in the present movement. A graceful movement is one that feels like it already carries the fullness of the movement-passing within the preacceleration of the movement taking form. Time collapses into an intensity of process, and what we feel is not the object of the experience but the flow of experience itself.
