Without the two together, we cannot fully participate in experience. The world flattens when causal relationality falls out of it, becoming “stained glass windows.” What is experienced is not a worlding but an infinite refraction of colored glass. It’s like a sensory overload without anywhere to fold but in, infinitely. Miss T explains: “I can do nothing alone. I can do anything with—with music or people to help me. I cannot initiate, but I can fully share . . . The moment you go away I am nothing again” (qtd. in Sacks 1990, 61). What is missing in this case is the capacity to auto-link sensation to worlding. Techniques of recombination fail to extend beyond the infolding sensa enveloping her.
