Marey’s experiments with movement are thus always also experiments with perception. By experimenting with the body in movement, Marey actually provokes the sensing body in movement, inventing machines for the transduction of feeling into sensing. He wants to perceive the incorporeal, and to do so, he must push the senses to the edge of what they can do. He must create techniques through which the senses’ virtual tendencies are transformed into actual processes for re-visualization.66 What we virtually feel must become actually sensed. Marey’s machinic experiments do not teach vision to see that which is imperceptible. They foreground the activity of perception that is at the heart of vision. Marey’s movement experiments are, in the end, experiments with sensation.
