If we were conscious of the quality of our movement—our posture—passing through every reconfiguration of the body moving, we wouldn’t move much. We would be too busy tweaking our movement as it was happening. In fact, we would be trying to stop-start the movement, getting in the way of the reconfigurations of the pure plastic rhythm of movement moving. It would be like trying to get at the force of movement to alter its trajectory by holding it back.
