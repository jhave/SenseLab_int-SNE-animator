Although the interval cannot be directly perceived, it can be prehended. For Whitehead (1929/1978), the actuality created by a prehension is called an actual occasion. In the case of the two dancers, the actual occasion will not be the fact of the displacement as such but the act of it. How the movement is prehended is a unique experience. The singularity of prehension serves to remind us that there is not one common interval but an infinity of relational intervals that together create space-time as we experience it. Like prehensions, actual entities are multiple, operating on a nexus. Each series—of a walk, of a dance—is composed of a nexus of differentiated prehensions recomposed into actual occasions. Each of these actual occasions operates in a specific space-time on a nexus that shape-shifts in the recomposing space-time of sensing bodies in movement. The interval operates in the multidimensionality of the nexus, becoming with a region of vague and material essences. These essences, defined by Edmund Husserl as “anexact yet rigorous,” are neither metric nor fixed. The interval that is prehended remains incorporeal, yet inextricably connected to the corporeal, resulting in what Deleuze and Guattari call “an ambulant coupling, events-affects, which constitutes the vague corporeal essence and is distinct from the secondary linkage, ‘fixed essence-properties of the thing deriving from the essence’” (1987, 409).
