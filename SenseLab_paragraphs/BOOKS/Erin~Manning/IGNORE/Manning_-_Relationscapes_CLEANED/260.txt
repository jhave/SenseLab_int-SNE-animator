Let me return to my example of walking to the bus stop. Earlier, I suggested that the ground’s recomposition of the dancing body was simply an extreme example of the everyday walking body’s relation to ground. You might say: whereas the dancing body specifically dances the ground, walking to the bus stop is an activity that presupposes a stable ground. Is it so cut and dry?
