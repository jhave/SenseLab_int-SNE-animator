Salt on Mina Mina (2002) constitutes a fact in itself, even as it conserves deep resonances both to Salt on Mina Mina (2001) and to the original site and Dreaming which it had “in mind.” A Dreaming is a Whiteheadian fact. It is not a form with a single iteration—it morphs across iterations that exist in time and compose space-times of experience. For Whitehead, each fact is more than its forms. “Form ‘participates’ throughout the world of facts” (1929/1978, 20). A Dreaming is a relational network of stories, dances, dreams, images. It is the fact of their eventful reiterability. This morphing force of Law is both definite and indefinite. It has parameters even while it holds within itself the potential for infinite variation. The Dreaming is a fact of present life with an intensive core that constitutes what it can do as a creative force for the future.
