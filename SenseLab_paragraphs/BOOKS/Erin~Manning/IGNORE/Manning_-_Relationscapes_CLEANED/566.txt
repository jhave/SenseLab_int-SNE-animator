The will to power of the Dreaming is the capacity to affect and be affected. “The will to power manifests itself as the sensibility of force; the differential element of forces manifests itself as their differential sensibility” (Deleuze 1983, 62–63). What is felt through the Dreaming is the force of life, asking of life that it manifest itself again: “Was that life?” asks Nietzsche. “Well then! Once more!” (1961, 178). The coming to life through the Dreaming depends on the potential of the force of life itself. And yet, as manifested in Napangardi’s paintings, life and Dreaming coexist on the extensive continuum as one and the same, infinitely interwoven in an intensive movement of foreground and background. Populated and populating, the Dreaming is an embodied contrast, a determinate fact that creates the potential for indeterminacy.1 Indeterminacy is essential as an intensive expanse for forces at play.
