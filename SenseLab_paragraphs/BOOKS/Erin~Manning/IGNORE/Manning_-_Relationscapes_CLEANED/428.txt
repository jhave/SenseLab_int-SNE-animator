This pure plastic rhythm is an immanent form in every sense. Rarely portrayed in its complete organicity within the frame, the body in Riefenstahl moves across milieus through conjunctive rhythms that create movements of thought. These movements of thought are not metaphorical. They are virtually present in each biogram, in each recomposition of shifting series. They are much more potent than any content-driven politics. Whereas content-driven politics offer the opportunity to stage resistance by producing or reacting to an object of contention, Riefenstahl’s work propels thought into recombination. Affectively, her work draws us into space-times of experience that are not yet composed around a specific body. It becomes our task to compose from the edges of expression to the body’s virtual center.
