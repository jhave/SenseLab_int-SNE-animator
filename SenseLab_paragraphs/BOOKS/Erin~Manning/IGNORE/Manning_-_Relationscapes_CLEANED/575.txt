The ground is a landing site for the camera in Rosas danst Rosas. It is not a land-ing site in the sense that landing implies a grounding. It is a landing site in the sense that ground makes the quality of the dance felt. That ground is a landing site for Rosas danst Rosas means that the ground is far more than the concrete surface that holds the building upright. It is also, and more importantly, that which makes the difference in the dance, and that which the camera fields in its practice of watching-feeling. What we feel when we watch Rosas danst Rosas is the heaviness of bodies dropping, the crispness of their movements folding back into and away from the finiteness of the groundâ€™s unrelenting surface.
