“You don’t start dancing. You dance.”18 We dance our way to concrescence. Concrescence can be a political moment: the interval we are dancing is always more than the qualified “we.” This “we” transfers any thought of subjectivity beyond the individual not simply to individuation but also to infra-individuation, to a thought of the collective that does not emerge from a group of individuals but precedes the very concept of individuality. To locate the many in the one and add one is to suggest that every movement is first and foremost collective: collective and singular. It is collective in the sense that it is relational, that it has a profound effect on the composition of its intensive extensions. These intensities become movements of thought, where thought is never distinct from the movement itself. Movements of thought are potential articulations of the political. Such articulations propose that we are never alone in the world: movements of thought are worldings that recombine the potential for collective thought.
