From walking to relational movement is no big leap: it’s already what you do. Except you may not have noticed, you may not yet have perfected your technique, because you were too busy trying to “get through” the crowd. The most straightforward way to conceive relational movement is side by side, or face to face. Think walking with a lover, or dancing tango. Walking relationally means: when you walk into the hole, you walk-with. Walking-with is more than taking a step, it is creating a movement.
