The labyrinths of folds virtually active in the interval are becoming-bodies of movement. They are not steps, nor can they be translated as such. They are potential directions, potential elasticities, potential preaccelerations. Separating them out is impossible. Their indivisibility is what gives the interval its intensity. Intensive movement is always populated by such microperceptions. When we move the relation, we are creating and harnessing microperceptions that express themselves (virtually) in every movement. It is not that they preexist the movement, or that they can be called forth as such. They are the potential that is felt in the incipiency of the action, the potential that transduces matter into form. Mattering-form is movement not as identifiable figuration but as intensive figure. Figure as force taking form, as movement-with that shapes bodies-in-the-making.
