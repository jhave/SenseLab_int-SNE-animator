There is never just one landing site. Landing sites fold into one another, creating infoldings of perception in the making. In the first sequence of Rosas danst Rosas, there is an infinity of potential landing sites interconnecting, perceived with the incipient movements of the dancers dancing. “Landing sites dissolve into each other, or abut, or overlap, or nest within one another” (Arakawa and Gins 2002, 8). But there is a tonality of landing that stands out for the viewer: it is the invitation to watch-feel the movement as the camera catches it in its formation. This activity of catching the movement directs our watching, giving it a consistency that moves the intensity of the dance into our perceptual field. We catch that intensity and feel its tonality in each of the movements of the camera. It’s as though we were watching the camera move the dancers as it moves us.
