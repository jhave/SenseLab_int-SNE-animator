What holds the series together? Ball-discus-javelin and arms-grass-hoop are held together by the becoming-body of a biogram. The emergence of a biogram is not the creation of a static body. It is a virtual node out of which a bodyness can be felt. This feltness of a body is an affective experience. It is the tendency of a body to become that the biogram makes palpable. With the appearance of the biogram what is foregrounded is the affective tone of the event rather than a body as such. The becoming body has no fixed form—it is an exfoliating body. It creates space through both intensive and extensive movement, appearing as such only momentarily in its passage from incipiency to the elasticity of the almost. The body in Riefenstahl’s work is not given but produced—produced not in its entirety but in passing, in movement, not from one shot to another, but from one series to another.
