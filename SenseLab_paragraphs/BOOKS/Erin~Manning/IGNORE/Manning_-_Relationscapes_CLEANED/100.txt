When the body becomes a mobile form-force rather than a stable axis, anything is possible. Cunningham, and later Forsythe, seek not to capture the formforce of the body but to prolong the interval that emanates from this form-force to disarticulate what we too often have come to define as movement. The goal is not to displace but to create, to qualitatively change the composition (of the bodies, of space-time). This recombination is an active process that configures an event. Multiplicities are created that take the form of re-potentialized limbs reaching-toward what would seem to be the body’s outside, but will become the re-centering of that body’s reconfiguring. In Forsythe’s vocabulary: transport the line, curve the motion, reorient and follow until your movement reaches a point where it can no longer develop. Capture the intensity! Redirect it, or let it go. Field residual movement. Prolong it! Extrude it! Fold it! Feel how it populates the interval. Use torsion to reclaim this residual movement, create a multiplicity. Play with what’s left over, share it.
