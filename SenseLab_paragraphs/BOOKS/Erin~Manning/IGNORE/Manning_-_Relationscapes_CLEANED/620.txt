Baggs invites us to participate in the complex interplay of the transversal passage between thought, concept, and articulation. Through feeling, thought begins to take form as a conceptual force. We experience textures giving way to qualities of form. We hear movement becoming sound. A tension is felt between the determination of language signifying and prearticulation’s appetition. The milieu of appetition in Baggs’s responsive environment is the relay created through the valuation of musical resonance that activates the conjunctive series object-sound-gesture and the prearticulation of an incipient worlding.
