Perished actual occasions populate the nexus out of which experience is made. There is no movement that is not nested within another movement with which it is in continuity. As events become and perish, they create openings for new events. Every opening in relational movement marks the potential for an infinity of approaches. “When they perish, occasions pass from the immediacy of being into the non-being of immediacy” (Whitehead 1933, 237). Events do not perish into nothingness. Like memories, they can be reactivated. To reactivate an event is not to recreate the same movement again but to invent a new movement that calls forth a certain array of recognizable elastic points.
