Baggs articulates felt thought. To articulate thinking-feeling is to activate the conceptual at work in the prearticulation of the experiential. To bring concepts to life rather than simply the contours of things is the first step in expressing the force of a relational environment. Bringing potential relations into actual experience, as Baggs notes, is “a way of thinking in its own right.” Thought is more than a form-taking of words. It is an incipience that proposes articulation through sensation. Thought is a proposition for feeling-in-motion. It is experience’s complex instigator, a force that operates at the relational cusp of becoming-events.
