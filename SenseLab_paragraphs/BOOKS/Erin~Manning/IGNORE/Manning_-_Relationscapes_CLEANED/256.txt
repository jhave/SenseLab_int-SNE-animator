If technology can recompose a body beyond the level of sensuous perception—beyond the directness of an operation that makes something seen, such as an arm movement translating into a video image—bringing the relational quality of experience to the fore, technology becomes technogenesis. In a technogenetic event, more than displacement or representation must be perceived. What must also be felt—by the dancer first and foremost, but also by those participating in the performance as spectators—are the microperceptions through which the displacement is activated. Many of these perceptions are non-sensuous because they work at the level of the barely there, below the threshold of sensuous perception. Rather than the sensory perception itself, we must feel the relation out of which the movement event emerges. This experience is affective and cannot be separated from the creation of space-times the technogenetic event calls forth.
Technogenesis contributes concern to the event that does not end with the performance: the affective tone’s residue lingers, provoking adjacent forms of experience, many of which remain virtual. Technogenesis always involves more that the datum, more than the sense-presentation, more than the present. Technogenesis makes the process felt, foregrounding the duration of the individuating machinic body.
