Propositions are a lure for feeling. By propulsing the event toward what it can do, they effect the concrescence of an actual occasion. Assembling effects of relation across the nexus of actual occasions, propositions act as the pulling together of the stakes of language in-formation. To become articulate, in these terms, involves expressing what the feeling has felt.
