Hester describes this imploding universe as akin to looking through a stained-glass window refracted at odd angles in an infinity of opaque layers. What Hester describes is the immanence of the absoluteness of movement infolding. Sense-presentation takes over, relegated to a regressive passivity, a taking-in that becomes an observation of infinite refraction. Causal links are increasingly distant. Taking the place of relational networks is a kind of memory of sense, a “pure,” undifferentiated sensing rather than a sensing-with. There is nowhere to go but in.
