Topological geographies create new art histories. Red against yellow, black against brown, dots, lines, circles, footprints, all of these gestures toward the Dreaming extend themselves beyond a body or a canvas, creating movements of thought. These movements of thought provoke response-ability: we cannot but move. We cannot but sense the shades of difference that create the activity of the land. We cannot but respond relationally. We cannot participate and then refuse the immanence of the “whole” these paintings generate.
