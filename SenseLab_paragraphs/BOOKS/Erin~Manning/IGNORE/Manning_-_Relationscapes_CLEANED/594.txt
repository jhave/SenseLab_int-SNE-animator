There is a shift in tone. The camera once again filming from behind her, we observe a quieter sound: paper flittering against the framed vista of the yard outside. The almost-sound of the paper moving is felt as a change in atmosphere. Then, sped up through the flittering gesture of her wrist, Baggs’s voice modulates, hitting a demi-tone. We are moving again to the rhythm of the earlier section as we watch the spiral of the paper shape-shift into Baggs’s twirling motion around the knobs of a dresser. From object-sound-creation (the flittering paper) to gesture-object-movement (twirling around the knob), her tonal voice-sound resonant throughout, this section of Baggs’s video makes experiential musicality felt as a sound-moving-with and a moving-with-sound. This creates an amodal relay that distributes sound throughout the sensing body in movement as both the effect of movement and the instigator of experiential space-time. We experience this sound-movement tonally, affectively, through a rhythmic reinvention of the environment’s sensory dimensions.
