To create movement for the sake of movement, Merce Cunningham adopts randomness as a choreographic method and decomposes sequences of movement by multiplying traditional articulations (Gil 2002, 118). Randomness becomes a way of awakening the interval, thereby shifting the focus from the body as subject to the production of movement itself. This production of movement potentially becomes a recomposition of the body not as subject but as collective infra-individuation. The goal is to “break the patterns of personal remembered physical coordinations” (Cunningham 1951, 59). Movement is no longer asked to express something outside it: movement becomes its own artwork (oeuvre).
