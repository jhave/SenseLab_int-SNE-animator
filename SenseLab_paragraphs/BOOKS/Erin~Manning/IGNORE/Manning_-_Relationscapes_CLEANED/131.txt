An intensive figure does not represent. It durationally evokes. It provokes and propels. A figure is active transience from one form to another, a molecular, mattering-form that transduces. Referring to Cézanne’s theory that the figure produces sensation, Deleuze writes: “The figure is the sensible form related to a sensation; it acts immediately on the nervous system, which is of the flesh” (2003, 31). Sensation is what is produced, but not a sensation of, a sensing-with and toward. Moving relationally we sense not the step per se (though we do step it, otherwise we would not walk)—we sense the intensity of an opening, the gathering up of forces toward the creation of space-times of experience into which we move. As the movement begins to fold into another movement, we feel its elasticity, opening the movement’s shape to its inevitable deformation.
