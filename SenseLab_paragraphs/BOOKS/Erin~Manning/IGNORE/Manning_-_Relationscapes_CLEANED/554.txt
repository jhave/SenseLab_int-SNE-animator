The story of Karntakurlangu tells of more than the women dancing with their digging sticks. There is a continuation of the narrative told by other related Dreamings, which involves a snake ancestor called Walyankarna. The snake got its name because of the meeting place—Walyankarna—where the snake was cast into the air by the dust of the ancestral women’s digging sticks. The second part of the story, as narrated by Tiger Tjapaltjarri (qtd. in Nicholls 2002, 64), reveals that the snake resumes traveling and begins to follow the women, soon becoming a snake-man.118 Having reached them, he begins to stalk the women, spying on them dancing in long lines with their digging sticks, their movements following the cracks above the yams growing underground. In the ensuing battle between the snake-become-rapist and the ancestral women, the snake-man is killed by their digging sticks. This last portion of the story is not actually part of Napangardi’s Dreaming. It is called Two Snake Dreaming and belongs to a different skin group. But perhaps its virtual presence is what we feel in Napangardi’s Karntakurlangu Jukurrpa (2000b) as the violence of a certain force of possession taking over.
