Salt on Mina Mina reverberates with the movement of digging sticks dancing. It is one iteration of a story Dorothy Napangardi will tell many times in the years to come. In this painting, the pathways are multiple, their meeting points infinite. Up and down and across, the dotted lines transverse the cloth, populating the canvas with a thousand potential convergences. And yet despite the majestic quietude of the work, it will not sit still long enough to allow us to determine exactly where the encounter takes place.
Stephen Page describes Aboriginal dancing as “foot to earth” (qtd. in Mundine 2002, 68). Dancing low to the ground, the movement concentrated in the knees, it is as though the earth itself were moving the body. Salt on Mina Mina dances the earth moving. It does not represent women dancing: it dances their digging, moving-with the trajectory of their passing. These are not dots left behind: they are dots in the making. We feel the force of their taking-form. This is why we can’t stop looking, our eyes roving over the work, incapable of finding a resting-point.
