Physical transcendence involves transmutation from force to form, where the force field continues to be immanent to the experience of the taking-form. Transmutation produces not simply a change of state; it invents a new process. Physical transcendentalism for Boccioni is immanently material, material not in the sense of material stability (if there were such a thing) but in the sense of the becoming-molecular of matter’s virtual tendencies. An event is physically transcendental when the virtuality of force is felt in and through the material stratum, such that its materiality exposes and makes felt the virtual potential of its force. The physical transcendental is the mobile cut that produces “mysterious affinities which create formal and reciprocal influences between the different planes of an object” (Boccioni 1970b, 61).
