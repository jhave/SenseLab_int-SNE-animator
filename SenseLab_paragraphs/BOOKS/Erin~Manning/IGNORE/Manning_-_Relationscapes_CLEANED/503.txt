Two series stand out for me—though it might be possible to speak of Kngwarreye’s whole oeuvre as a giant, modulating, dancing series—because of the activity of relation felt across the planes of intensity that take the form of conceptually connected panels. The first of this series is entitled Utopia Panels. It was made in 1996 and comprises six panels of black horizontal lines on a white background. What is eerie about this series is the fact that although the black paint is applied to a white surface, the black and white interweave such that the white “background” folds forward into the black lines, thus foregrounding its backgrounding. Background here takes a more Whiteheadian meaning, referring not to a predetermined state but to an activity of interrelation that makes felt the virtually emergent. A virtually emergent state is one that has not yet appeared as such, yet holds within itself the potential for transformation. This potential is entirely relational: a background is a nexus of past actual occasions poised to be reactivated into appearance. Whitehead explains this incipient pastness through the concept of non-sensuous perception. He writes: “We can discern no clean-cut sense-perception wholly concerned with present fact. . . . The evidence on which these interpretations are based is entirely drawn from the vast background and foreground of non-sensuous perception with which sense-perception is fused, and without which it can never be” (Whitehead 1933, 181). A foregrounding of the non-sensuous evokes the has-been of the notquite-yet. This prehension of pastness is a direct perception of a relation that is barely actual. In Utopia Panels, the becoming-white of the black lines evokes the perishing of the discreteness of past and present, white and black. “The present moment is constituted by the influx of the other into that self-identity which is the continued life of the immediate past within the immediacy of the present” (Whitehead 1933, 181).
