Like a looking-into thin air, imaging landing sites have a quality of daydreaming. They are perceptions at the level of presentational immediacy, where what we perceive is the experiential qualities of perception in the making. The film of Rosas danst Rosas experiments with perception dancing, capturing both the specificity of the measure of choreography landing and the haze of its microperceptual imaging. We become sited in the fielding of the quasi chaos of microperceptions, an experience that leaves us out of breath, our muscles tense with the twitching of kinaesthetic empathy. We move with the intensive magnitude of the micromovements moving.
