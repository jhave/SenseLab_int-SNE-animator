Eternal objects fold into an event as its qualitative differential. They inflect the event’s final form without necessarily changing its content, creating nuance within it at the level of small perceptions. “It is the differential relations among these infinitely small actuals that draw into clarity; that is to say, that constitute a clear perception (the color green) with certain small perceptions, obscure, and evanescent (the colors yellow and blue)” (Deleuze 1993, 90; translation modified). They determine the character of perceptions in folding.
