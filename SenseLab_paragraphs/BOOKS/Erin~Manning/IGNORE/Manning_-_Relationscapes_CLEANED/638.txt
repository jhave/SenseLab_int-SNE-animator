Taking form always begins with the terminus. The terminus is not an end point but the energy of a beginning. The terminus kick-starts the process of articulation. There is no causal finitude here: we never know what becomes of a beginning. The directionality we have “in mind” is a relation of tension, a reaching-toward that makes us think, always more than a goal. The terminus is a force of thought toward articulation.
We often assume language’s termini are words. Words are not language’s termini; they are only one of the events along the way. The terminus of language is the relational folding-through of prearticulation. Language emerges not through an already-constituted thought: it merges with thought’s tendency toward relation. How thought becomes relational is how language begins to take form. With prearticulation comes a feeling-with that proposes the potential of a taking form. This event in the making articulates itself in an infinity of ways, sensingly, linguistically, affectively. The terminus of language is the propensity for expression that forces an immanent conjunction into appearance. The concept proposes an actual occasion that affects experience-in-the-making by foregrounding nodes of relation that are themselves relays between different qualities of potential expressivity. Language folds in on termini, its impetus for expression always allied to the force of its prearticulation.
