The digital—the locus of the “techne” in most new technology—operates in a much more stable manner than does the analog. Its parameters are preset, even when change in state is what is at stake. The result: you had to know in advance what could happen. This effect of preknowing what a body could do limits its technogenetic potential. For technogenesis to occur, what must be sought is a way to foreground the effects of unknowability that are virtually present in all movement. The incipiency of movement’s emergence must be tapped. This access to virtuality is not yet available to digital computation, which must conform to actual ones and zeros. By bringing the analog into the digital mix (by intermixing new technologies with dancing bodies such that the dancing body is emergent with the technology rather than simply added to it), the technical system might tend toward ontogenesis, toward technogenetic evolution.
