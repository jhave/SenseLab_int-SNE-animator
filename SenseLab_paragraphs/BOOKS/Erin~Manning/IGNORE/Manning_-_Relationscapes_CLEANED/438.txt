Polyrhythm is the capacity to become through movement on more than one plane at once. It merges becoming-movement with becoming-rhythm. Most of the time, Riefenstahl builds in polyrhythm, creating an architectonics through the montage while overlaying it with audio rhythms and bringing them together to create ever more complex rhythms. Durations layer and begin to move, the movement felt in its incipiency. This creates a sensation of cutting-across that prolongs the potential of one rhythm while adding to it, which is no doubt why capturing her images is such an uncanny proposition, each capture as evocative as the last. Composition reaches the heights of commanding form when it exceeds the sum of its parts. This more-than must survive multiple repetitions and must produce difference each time. It must be open, yet controlled. In Riefenstahl, the sum is dense with rhythm. It is dense with the constraint of the structure of composition that will culminate in a polyrhythmic movement-image that works. To work, the polyrhythm must produce the effect of an overlayering, whereby the body expresses itself electrically even while it backgrounds itself atmospherically. The body-becoming is the protagonist onto which polyrhythmic surfaces expand, fold, bend, emerge, collapse. For Dalcroze, musical rhythms can be appreciated only in relation to the atmosphere and space in which they move, only in relation to silence and immobility. “Musical rhythmics is the art of establishing due proportion between sound movement and static silence, of opposing them, and of preparing for the one by means of the other, according to the laws of contrast and balance on which all style depends” (Dalcroze 1921, 149).
