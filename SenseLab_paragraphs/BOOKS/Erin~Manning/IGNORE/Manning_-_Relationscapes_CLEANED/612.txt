Nietzsche implores, “Value! Don’t evaluate!” He proposes we conceive of value as a differential vector in the process of creation. Valuing is a form of prearticulation tantamount to the incipient process of movement’s preacceleration taking form. It underscores the force of expression. In language, valuation is how words are culled from the nexus, their enunciation always coupled with their force of expression. Foregrounding valuation within language emphasizes the amodal relays that make words felt. Words: valuations that move between complex relays from gesture to sound, from vision to touch. Valuing the incipient quality of expression is to feel language’s impulse, to express the taking form of thought moving. Valuation is an immanent process that situates expression’s final form in a relational attitude toward the world where language dances thought’s becoming-form.
