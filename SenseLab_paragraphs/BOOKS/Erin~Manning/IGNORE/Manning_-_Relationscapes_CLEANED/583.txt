Landing sites choose us, creating an associated milieu that worlds the bodyenvironment. “The events are decision-like but far from . . . decisions” (Arakawa and Gins 2002, 9). Decision is used here in a Whiteheadian sense as the becomingactual of a virtual potential. For Whitehead decision is what gives the event form, and by consequence, creates an individuation. The decision of the landing site is its focusing into experience. We land into the focus of an awareness that becomes us. “Actuality is the decision amid potentiality” (Whitehead 1929/1978, 42). The decision is the separating-off, the honing in that makes a particular tonality take form. A decision creates the potential for consciousness, not the other way around. A decision is like a “hook onto the environment to gain traction on it” (Arakawa and Gins 2002, 8).
