A choreographed encounter is never wholly what it seems. You can’t really choreograph movement. Movement slips through the grid, it micromoves into morphings not only unforeseeable but even unseeable, microperceptions more virtual than actual. I can train you to move-toward a sense of space, toward a quality of speed, of extension. I can offer you openings for the creations of experiential space-times. But I can’t choreograph your landing sites.
