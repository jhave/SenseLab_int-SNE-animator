Duration is a way of thinking space-time qualitatively without subsuming it to a certain measuring out of space. Duration is the rendering of what Bergson calls intensive magnitudes: “Pure duration might well be nothing but a succession of qualitative changes, which melt into and permeate one another, without precise outlines, without any tendency to externalize themselves in relation to one another, without any affiliation with number; it would be pure heterogeneity” (2002, 61). When space-time is no longer entered but instead created, it becomes possible to think the body-world as that which is generated by the potential inherent in the preacceleration of movement. Movement takes time. But movement also makes time. Forsythe suggests that the velocity of the movements he proposes to his dancers could not be choreographed without first slowing them down. To choreograph is to hold incipiency to measure.
Movement provokes duration even as duration provokes movement. Measurable quantity is anathema to duration. This is why the displacement itself—the movement from a to b—is not what is essential about movement. Movement is the qualitative multiplicity that folds, bends, extends the body-becoming toward a potential future that will always remain not-yet. This body-becoming (connecting, always) becomes-toward, always with. I move not you but the interval out of which our movement emerges. We move time relationally as we create space: we move space as we create time.
