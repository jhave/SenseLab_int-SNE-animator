Technogenesis cannot be premapped. How then can it work alongside a technological system whose parameters are set? The ontogenetic coupling of digital technology with the originary technicity of the individuating body must take this into account. Rather than mapping the technology—as a prosthesis—onto a moving body, it is necessary to incite the movement to appear out of the technological process that is the machinic assemblage of individuation.
