This is Marey’s quandary. On the one hand, he is drawn to the satisfying results of concrete division. On the other hand, he is moved by the interval. His work posits clear distinctions between movement and body. And yet he never begins the process of experimentation from outside the experiment: he experiments from the middle. He posits the body as preconstituted, and yet creates experimental devices that foreground the body’s permeability to forces, its transitions coloring its becoming-states.
Marey’s crossing-over from positivism to radical empiricism and back can be felt most strongly in his chronophotographic images, which experiment with the idea of overlapping states of transition. Even as Marey defines his results according to precise coordinates of movement in time and space, he continues to devise ways of perceiving the transition from incipiency to displacement as the interplay of relational movement, thus creating a moving space-time in a durationally multilayered environment. Through his chronophotographies, Marey ultimately explores the animation of space-time where different layers of bodies in transition interweave. This experiential overlapping of states is what Bergson calls pure succession, an interplay of fields of intensity and qualities of movement melding that produce the feeling of the force of form.
