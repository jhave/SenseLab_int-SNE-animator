Now take a sidewalk and add walking: you are moving quickly, trying to get through the crowd to catch the bus. You have two blocks to navigate, and the crowd makes it difficult. You weave through the people, taking bigger and smaller steps, looking for holes and then filling them, inhabiting them momentarily before they close. Hopefully no child, friend, or lover is lagging behind: sidewalk holes are rarely big enough for two people. And yet walking “alone” does not exist. Walking in/with the world: the only kind of walking.
