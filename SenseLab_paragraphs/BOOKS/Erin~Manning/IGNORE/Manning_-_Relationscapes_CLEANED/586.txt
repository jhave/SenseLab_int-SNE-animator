Arakawa and Gins outline three categories of landing sites: some are “perceptual,” some are “dimensionalizing,” and some are “imaging.” The perceptual landing sites work as a foregrounding of a conscious perception from the murkiness of experience as a whole. The dimensionalizing landing sites give the foreground a sense of measure, a traction. The imaging landing sites field widely, working-through a haze of microperceptions in the folding. To look-with movement moving is to experience this third kind of landing. Imaging landing sites are active at the level of the as-yet unprocessed, at the cusp of what James calls pure experience.
