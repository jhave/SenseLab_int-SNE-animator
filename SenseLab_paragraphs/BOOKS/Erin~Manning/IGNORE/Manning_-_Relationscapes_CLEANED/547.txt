Painting the Dreaming means working with the force of its potential for reiteration. An encounter with a painting such as Napangardi’s Sandhills of Mina Mina (2002) is therefore both an event in itself associated with a time and place,116 and an engagement with the Dreaming as extensive continuum. Participating at both levels of expression, Napangardi’s paintings foreground the activity of the Dreaming’s reiteration that orients the Dreaming to its ontogenetic potential. The Dreaming becomes a double iteration of multiple sense in the plurality of constellations of its form-taking. Napangardi’s work activates the Dreaming’s potential to create new kinds of futures in the present. Through her work, the Dreaming becomes both a technology of the future and a technique for the present, opening the present to its potential for experiential complexity. Open to the indeterminacy of experience, Dreamings such as those evoked through Napangardi’s work resonate with an ontogenetic plurality of sense(s).
