Deformation—topological becoming—gives relational movement its rhythm. The sensation of moving the relation is rhythmic, a topological transformation that folds to infinity. The sensation is multiple, but not multiplied. It works on many levels at once—macroand microperceptual—operating on planes rather than in divided sequences. These planes of sensation are amorphous—they never produce a recognized feeling that can be repeated in the same way. They are felt not in their form but in their effects. Sensation is accumulated, it morphs and coagulates and disperses, always operative between levels. Sensation is in and of movement.
