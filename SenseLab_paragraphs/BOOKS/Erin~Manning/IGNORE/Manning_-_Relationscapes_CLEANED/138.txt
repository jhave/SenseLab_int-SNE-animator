Inflection is inseparable from infinite variation. There is no elastic point that resides on the curve in the same way each time. The curve creates an elastic point as much as the elastic point becomes the curve. The elastic point is a traveling node along a fluctuating line that has no beginning nor end, “enveloping a world infinitely spongy and cavernous, constituting more than a line and less than a surface” (Deleuze 1988a, 23). This is not a measurable point— its elasticity makes it infinitely malleable. It is a folding point, a curvilinear detour that moves not from point to point but in an infinite circumvolution that becomes the movement itself. The interval created by relational movement is the plane of consistency of this circumvolution, elasticity the plane of composition.
