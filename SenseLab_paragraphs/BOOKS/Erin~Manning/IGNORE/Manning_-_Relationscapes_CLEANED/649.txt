Without transduction, propositions have no force. Transduction is the unity of an event across its different phases, a processual individuation across strata that creates affinities between levels of experience. Propositions provoke transductions that alter what a particular relation can do in a given instance. Not every relational object is evocative in every instance. Each material shape-shifts into different affinities of purpose. Dynamic osmosis, Clark would say (Rolnik 2005).
