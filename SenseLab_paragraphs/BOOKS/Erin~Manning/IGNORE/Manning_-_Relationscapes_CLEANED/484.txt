The country for which Clifford Possum is response-able forms a wide arc with a radius of some 100 km centered approximately 200 km northwest of Alice Springs. It stretches from Waltunpunyu, west of Central Mount Wedge in the south, up through Napperby and Mount Allan stations, northwest as far as the blue hill of Wakulpa just north of Yuendumu, and northeast across Mount Denison and Conisten Stations (Johnson 2003, 21). From the perspective of a Cartesian geography, this is Anmatyerre country. Topologically, Anmatyerre country is more complex.
