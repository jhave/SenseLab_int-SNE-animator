The blue quivers in a quietness the red does not propose. The blue calms the one side of the animate sculpture, inviting us to view again the inverted bodylegs of the becoming-bull. But we canâ€™t distance ourselves from the red, which catches our eye in an incessant calling. We find the blue cannot be seen without the appearance of red. Red here expresses itself as an active multiplicity. This multiplicity rears its four heads, each head a play of forces of appearance and disappearance, a coming forward and moving back into the colored light of perception perceiving. We feel the threshold here, insistent and persuasive, between color, light, and movement.
