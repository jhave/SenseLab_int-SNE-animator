Creating an actual occasion harnesses an event, foreclosing momentarily the potential for recombination. There will of course be simultaneous recombinations at the level of the nexus, but a singular actual occasion—like Gottfried Leibniz’s monads—will always remain what it is in this instance. When this instance has outgrown its potential, the actual occasion will perish, leaving an opening for a repopulation of the recomposing nexus. Only the interval will survive this perishing. Although the interval as such can never be grasped or contained, it “ingresses” into new actual occasions, magnifying the potential within them. This shape-shifting of the interval is a rhythm that returns as a refrain, emphasizing that which populates the in-between. There is no empty space: space is the interval that creates refrains, rhythmically altering body-worlds.
The refrain is used here to convey time-slips within territorializations. To territorialize is always to stop movement, to begin the analysis from a stopping, and then to make the body move. To think movement through the refrain allows us to locate the interval as an absolute tempo whereby “time ceases to be exterior in order to become an intensive nucleus [ foyer] of temporalization” (Guattari 1995, 16). Rhythm is experiential duration that dislodges any concept of universal time. “From this perspective, universal time appears to be no more than a hypothetical projection, a time of generalized equivalence, a ‘flattened’ capitalist time; what is important are these partial modules of temporalization, operating in diverse domains (biological, ethological, socio-cultural, machinic, cosmic . . .), and out of which complex refrains constitute highly relative existential synchronies” (Guattari 1995, 16). Incorporeal becomings are made up of rhythmic intervals, rhythms that are detected as they are produced only to find themselves always already there.
