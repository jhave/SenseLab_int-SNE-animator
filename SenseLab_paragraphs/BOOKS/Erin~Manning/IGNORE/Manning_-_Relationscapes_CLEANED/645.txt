For Whitehead, each occasion of experience is characterized by a flash of novelty. This flash is an appetition, a desire at work. Appetitions propel propositions. Propositions are theories in the making. “The primary function of theories is a lure for feeling, thereby providing immediacy of enjoyment and purpose” (Whitehead 1929/1978, 184).
A proposition is never a judgment. Nor is it necessarily true. It is a terminus-in-action. Focusing appetition on the transitional relation that makes thought felt, propositions cut through the event, shifting the ground. For Lygia Clark, a proposition is the capacity for any object to take relational form. “Nothing, in Clark’s propositions, was ever reducible to a concrete body, empirical or organic” (Rolnik 2005, 9). Propositions move the concept into action, this movement always emergent, its creative potential never preestablished. “What I know now is that the body is more than the body” (Clark, qtd. in Rolnik 2005, 9).
