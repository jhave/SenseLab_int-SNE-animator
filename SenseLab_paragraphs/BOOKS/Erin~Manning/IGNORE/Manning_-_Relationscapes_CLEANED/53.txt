Rhythm comes to the fore through techniques for invention. Gilbert Simondon (1995) defines techniques as modalities for the creation of machinic resonances that defy a machine’s strict organization. He suggests that a technical system is one where the whole cannot be subsumed to its parts, where what converges is more than the sum of its coordinates. Techniques are imbued with rhythm, they move-with the machine’s own forces of recombination. To understand the relay between technique and machine, it is useful to be acquainted with Guattari’s concept of the machinic. For Guattari, the machinic expresses forces of creativity: “A machinic assemblage [is] an assemblage of possible fields, of virtual as much as constituted elements, without any notion of generic or species’ relation” (1995, 35). Machines demand life: they process always in the realm of the more-than, constantly recombining. Pure plastic rhythm is a machinic way of redefining what a body is, and even more so, what a body can do.
