The biogram works in a strange paradox of time. Take the series javelinball-discus. This series connects to itself through the repetition of the act of throwing. This repetition is already a difference, not only because of the different bodies or because of the different objects, but because each preacceleration of the throwing body qualitatively alters both what a body can do and what an image can do. Thrownness becomes body. Yet the becoming-body takes form only retrospectively in the biogrammatic conjunction of the series. What conjugates the series is the fact that a body will emerge. Composing the image while keeping its potential for flow alive is one of Riefenstahlâ€™s remarkable strengths.
