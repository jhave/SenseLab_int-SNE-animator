Marey’s machines are evolving techniques, themselves open to experimentation, working not to fulfill goals already written into their functioning but toward the invention of new milieus. These new milieus are in turn conditioned by the experimentations they provoke, always reconstituted according to the results toward which the experiments are geared. For example, when Marey seeks to understand the movement of the walk, he discovers that in order to get a clear picture of the movement itself, he must background everything except the walking. To do so, he develops various techniques of appearance/disappearance. He calls this simplification, situating movement in these cases as an extraction from the surrounding environment. In this series of experiments, Marey narrows the body-apparent to its simplest form for rendering its movement, choosing to highlight only certain points of the body as it moves, allowing the actual (the visible body) to slide into the virtual (the body unseen), such that what is actually perceived is the incipiency of movement moving. As the quasi virtual takes shape perceptually (the movement foregrounded instead of simply the body moving), what we experience is far from a dialectic of inside/outside that would separate environment and body: Marey creates an uncanny dance of appearance disappearing. We feel the palpability of the imperceptible. Body, movement, and environment have become one. Here, the trace of preacceleration is almost actualized, felt through the visualization of the flow of movement moving. It is as though he had not simply foregrounded how movement works but given movement back to movement, “drawing vision drawing.”
