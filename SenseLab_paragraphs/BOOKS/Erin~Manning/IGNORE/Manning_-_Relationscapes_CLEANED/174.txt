We are aware of the quality of our movement without being conscious of it. You might ask: what about pain? Aren’t we conscious of pain when it “gets in the way” of our movement moving? Pain produces a shift in awareness that makes us conscious of how we can’t move, but this consciousness is not of the movement per se. It is consciousness of how movement hurts. This awareness interrupts the intensive magnitude of a durational attitude. Pain shifts the texture of a movement. It makes the quality of the movement felt: a particular intensity in the durational attitude of the movement has differentiated itself. We feel the safe parameters of movement moving and resist those that cause a resurgence of pain. The negative of the movement has made the movement’s edge appear for consciousness. As Whitehead writes: “The negative perception is the triumph of consciousness” (1929/1978, 161).
