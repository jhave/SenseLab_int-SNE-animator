Blanchot speaks of “releasing the part of the event which its accomplishment cannot realize” (qtd. in Deleuze and Parnet 1987, 73). Marey does not simply create movement-events: his movement experiments create experiential space-times. He operates on more than one level of experience at once, working with the virtual becoming of elastic forces and with the actual becoming of curvatures of movement. Marey creates out of a dynamic ground that propels eventness to take form visually. His work offers a bringing-to-expression that continuously exceeds its original parameters for measure.
