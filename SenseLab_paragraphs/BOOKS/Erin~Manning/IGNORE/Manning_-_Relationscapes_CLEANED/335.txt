Since relations are always of different degrees of intimacy, measure does not suffice to make them known. What is necessary is a technique of the inbetween that does not seek to assess only the form-as-such (the object, the body) but that is also invested in the milieu through which it comes into emergence. All of Marey’s work operates through this tensile environment between measure-representation and rhythm-relation. This is a productive tension, fascinating in the way it challenges Marey’s commitment to positivist science and its modalities of measure. He produces, it seems, a continual doubling of experimentation, where he posits the result as the culmination, even while he continues to rebuild the machine that in its next rendition will open incipient movement toward new vistas of unmappability. If Marey were content with measure as such, there would be no need for a new machine, or a more complex technical system. Yet he keeps devising them, creating not only new machinic processes but new techniques of relation, plotting not representational movement in its discrete elements but relational movement, expressed through its incipiency.
