Napangardi paints the complexity of life’s contrasts, inviting the Dreaming to take form at the interstices of shades of becomings. These shades of becoming come to expression in movement throughout the work. Inventing-with the Dreaming’s incessant movement, she paints its abstract concreteness, experiencing its abstraction as real, inviting the virtual to coexist with the actual force of the work-emergent. The work’s appetite is felt as the force of the virtual taking form through the movement of its dance.
