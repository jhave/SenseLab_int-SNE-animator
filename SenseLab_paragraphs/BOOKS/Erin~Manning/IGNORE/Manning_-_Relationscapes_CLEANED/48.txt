Thought is ontogenetic: it propels more thought. Relationscapes takes this idea to the limit, proposing various engagements with movements of thought, from Leni Riefenstahl’s complex movement-images to Umberto Boccioni’s atmospheric body, from Dorothy Napangardi’s dance with the ground to Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri’s maps and Emily Kame Kngwarreye’s own relationscapes. With the concept of individuation—which also becomes infra-individuation—Relationscapes attempts to create a vocabulary for how movement becomes thought and vice-versa. In this eternal return of movement-becoming-thought and thought-becoming-movement, what emerges is the uncanny realization that movement tells stories quite differently than does a more linear and stable historicization.
