Clifford Possum’s maps do not ask to be read in this way. Never overly concerned with the time and space of representation, Clifford Possum painted his great map series by moving the canvas around him. Through the act of painting, the land shifted, and with this shift so did its relations to space-times of experience. Instead of strictly linking locations in gridded geometrical space, the canvas’s painted surface turns its attention to the Dreaming’s intensive movement. This immobile voyage moves toward experience rather than location: Clifford Possum takes his bearings not with a concept of due north but with the living relation that is the Dreaming.
What is at stake in Clifford Possum’s maps is not the omnipresent observer’s bird’s eye view of the landscape operating according to preestablished coordinates of space-time, but the relation between aspects of a Dreaming from the standpoint of a morphogenetic body. Like a tracker who continuously updates his or her bearings and alignment in space with each change of direction in the chase, Clifford Possum does not create an archival representation of land. He creates land/his Dreaming in relation to a communal painting becoming-body. He does not represent the Dreaming but indexes its intensive passage from the virtual to the actual.
