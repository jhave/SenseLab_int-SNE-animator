The event of force taking form is a definite fact with a date. In the becoming-active of force, a fight to the death has taken place between active and reactive forces. This becoming-active can never be felt as such—it can only be known in retrospect through the creation of novelty. Causing a change in nature, the becoming-active of force is a transmutation of value. “The transmuted feeling . . . is a definite physical fact whereby the final subject prehends the nexus” (Whitehead 1929/1978, 253). The becoming-active of force in Napangardi’s work is the activity of pulsation we feel through her work. There is a lot at stake in this work, which so masterfully plays the forces of containment against the forces of expression. The experience of participating in the force of her work taking form gives us a feeling for the Dreaming’s own will to power. This feeling for the Dreaming is experienced through the evolution of the transduction from actual occasion to nexus to extensive continuum. We feel the movement not as a given but as an active force of self-determination. This is a political act.
