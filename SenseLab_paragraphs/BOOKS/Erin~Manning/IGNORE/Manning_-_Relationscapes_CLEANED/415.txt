For Boccioni there is an implicit connection between rhythm and force. Forcelines are what bring materiality to life. In Riefenstahl, they move intensively, folding topologically, transmutational across series—from grass to hoop, from thrownness to sky—expressing the potentialities of matter. Matter becomes force before it becomes form. Modeling the atmosphere is not about creating an outside for a sculpture. The inside-outside dichotomy must be dissolved: with rhythm there are only folding surfaces. Transmutation is vital to this process, because rhythm is not about content: “Rhythm is not on the same plane as that which has rhythm” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 313). Rhythm is a force for mattering on the cusp between the actual and the virtual, felt both actually and virtually in the between of the series, causing a change of direction, a jump, a syncopation. Rhythm is that which propels the force of movement (the energetic throwing—of the discus, the javelin, the ball) and not the displacement as such. Rhythm takes hold in Olympia not where the bodies can be differentiated as individuals but where movement becomes body and body becomes movement. Rhythm in Riefenstahl is the n + 1 of the body in movement, the more-than that creates—tangibly, affectively—a becoming-body.
