These techniques are also preinscribed in her camera work. In the marathon sequence in Olympia, for instance, Riefenstahl attaches cameras to the bodies of the runners to impart the sense of rhythm of their running and then overlays the image with an orchestral movement so quick and powerful that it seems to qualitatively alter the running: through the relation between audio and image, it feels as though the runners are moving more slowly. As the music increases in crescendo, the cadence of the runner dissolves such that a rhythm emerges that no longer conforms to the measure of the steps hitting the concrete. We feel a thrownness of experience that is neither the running as such, nor the music per se. What we prehend is their internal mixing, their infolding. This multiple rhythm creates an affective layering whereby sheets of time begin to coexist. This thrownness is a polyrhythmic preacceleration whereby what is felt is becoming-movement more than actual spacing. The race becomes the body becoming orchestral.
