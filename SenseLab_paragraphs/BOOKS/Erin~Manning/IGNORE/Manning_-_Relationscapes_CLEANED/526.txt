Napangardi is a custodian of the story of the ancestral women with the digging sticks. Her telling of the story keeps it alive as it keeps her Dreaming: the Dreaming fashions her even as she recreates its eventful momentum in the future-past. Dreamings meander, alive with elements of futurity even as they continue to lay down the Law for generations to come. Like all stories, they are told again and again, taking form in their journey from one iteration to another, inviting the past into a present of its own making. This does not make them any less factual: Dreamings constitute facts even as they express the force of change.
