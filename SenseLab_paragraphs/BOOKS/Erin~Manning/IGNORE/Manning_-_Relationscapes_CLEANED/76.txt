William Forsytheâ€™s technologies of improvisation are a rich lexicon for the interval. Forsythe explores movement as both extensive and intensive space. His interest in what a body can do takes the movement-space of the body and extends it as far as the body can reach. He pushes the limit of extension, exploring how space is created through the infinite lines of flight of expansive bodies.16 In a space-time of continuous reorientation, not only do bodies metamorphose, but so does the space created by the incessant reorientation of the malleable coordinates of stagecraft. Space and body are in continuous shifting dialogue.
