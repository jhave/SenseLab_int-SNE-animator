Part of what keeps movement out of equilibrium is the way it worlds. Every movement is not simply of the body but moves-with the associated milieu of the body-world nexus that enfolds it. Reaching-toward can be a trip as much as it can be a touch. “It is not always at all easy to decide whether a particular movement has originated as an immediate response to a provocation from the environment, or if we ourselves have initiated the stream of motor activity” (Feldenkrais 1981, 139).
