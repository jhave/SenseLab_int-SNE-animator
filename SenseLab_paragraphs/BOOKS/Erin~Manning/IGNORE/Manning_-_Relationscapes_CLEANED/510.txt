Kngwarreye creates an artistic plane of composition that engages the plane of immanence. Her work is of potential, of sensations that are always at once percepts and affects. In What Is Philosophy, Deleuze and Guattari explain: percepts are not perceptions, and affects are not affections (feelings). Percepts are “independent of a state of those who undergo them” and affects do not arise from subjects but pass through them (Deleuze and Guattari 1994, 169). Affects are becomings-other of sensation. Kngwarreye’s art moves the body through the interpellation of increasingly complex sensations that are connected not to one final event but to the perpetuation of events alive in the “whole.” Compositions of forces are alive in her work, creating sensations as reachings-toward that do not capture the Dreamings but set them in motion, rendering the imperceptible perceptible and the perceptible imperceptible. Her paintings do not call forth the songs of the Dreamings, they dance them: “The refrain in its entirety is the being of sensation” (Deleuze and Guattari 1994, 184).
