Amanda Baggs’s In My Language is a proposition for conceptual thought. Propositions, in Whitehead, are not rules imposed on a concept from without: they are how feeling becomes conceptual. “If by the decision of the concrescence, the proposition has been admitted into feeling, then the proposition constitutes what the feeling has felt” (Whitehead 1929/1978, 186). Propositions constitute a “source for the origination of feeling which is not tied down to mere datum” (Whitehead 1929/1978, 186). They are the prearticulated force of the feeling making its appearance.
