Perception infolds thoughts in the making. It does not reflect the world, it ingathers its relational fact into a feeling for its future infolding. An object becomes the threshold for thinking feeling. The event is not “seeing an object” but folding the “objectile” that contributes to perception’s infolding. We perceive-with objects, catching the edges of their contours, participating in the relations they call forth. Eternal objects make ingress into this object-world individuation, creating the potential for future relation. The objectness of the object is how it is felt relationally, rather than simply its actual matter-form. How it takes form on the nexus is how we prehend it. This quality of relation is what gives an object-event its potential infinitude. Perception is the force for the world’s infinite unfolding.
