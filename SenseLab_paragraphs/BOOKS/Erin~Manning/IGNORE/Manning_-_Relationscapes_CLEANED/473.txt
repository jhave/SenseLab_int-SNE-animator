“To paint a Dreaming is at once to regenerate one’s forces and to connect the object or the person to the earth and to the space-time of the hero who ‘dreams’ the life of people and their environment” (Glowczewski 1989, 83).90 To dream is never an individual affair. Even night dreams in Aboriginal communities extend beyond the individual body: my dream may be your dream experienced through the vessel of my becoming-form. The earth-as-body is the support for the traces of ancestral bodies and the metamorphoses of experience in the present. It is a mnemonic for the Law of the Dreaming. To dream is to be in contact with others, to dream their dreams: “The agreement of others is necessary. An oneiric vision is attested as ‘real’ only on condition that it is connected to pictorial forms and narratives . . . that have been transmitted for hundreds of generations” (Glowczewski 1989, 151). There is never a single version that works for all Dreamings, but as many versions and contexts as are necessary for the story to be composed again.
