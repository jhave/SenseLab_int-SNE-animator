For Whitehead, consciousness is always felt after the fact. Consciousness is a recollection of a movement having moved. We cannot be conscious of posture as such because it is a durational attitude of a becoming-movement. It is the breath of movementâ€™s in-gathering. The quality of posture is expressed virtually in the displacement that follows. Posture is the threshold, the incipient grace, the texture that contributes to having known what it felt like to move. It has a consistency, which explains why other people can recognize postural tendencies when they watch you move. But you cannot know it as such because how you move movement is not something you are conscious of.
