Standing still makes felt the incipient force of micromovements reconfiguring the body’s stilling. Since we’re not so busy getting somewhere, we can feel our movement moving still. The feeling of losing our balance is amplified by the quietening of the reconfiguration. This is not yet consciousness of a movement. What we experience are virtual forces recombining, microperceptions shifting. Consciousness comes after the fact, when we realize we’ve lost our balance. A shift in space-time makes us aware of the displacement. We know what we’ve felt when we are no longer in the feeling.
