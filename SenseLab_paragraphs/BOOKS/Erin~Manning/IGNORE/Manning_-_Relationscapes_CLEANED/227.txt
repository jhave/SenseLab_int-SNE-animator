Evolutionary systems that build on accumulation are emerging. Still, too often the “emergent” quality of the system depends on how the body moves with the software. Here’s the paradox: moving-with the software means learning to move the software. Whether you plan it this way or not, the choreography becomes determined by the software, which qualitatively limits what a body can do. Where technology was supposed to open the body to a wider relational potential, it actually reduces the body’s capacity to create experiential space-time through micromovements in the making. The dancer learns to traverse space rather than to create it. For technogenesis to occur, the dance must surprise even the dancer—it must move toward relational eventfulness. For this to take place, recompositions of potential (movement taking-form through virtual recombinations shape-shifting into displacements) are necessary, activated not simply by or in relation to an external source but in tandem with the co-composition of an event in the making.
This is not a plea to return to a pretechnologized body, or to abandon a technologically enhanced dancing body. It is an invitation to explore the potential of technogenesis for the sensing body in movement. For this, a vocabulary of process is necessary. Process here means working with enabling constraints that create the conditions for ontogenetic emergence. To experiment with a digitally enhanced post-technologized body beyond the dichotomy of the organic/prosthetic is to ask what a body can do such that it is not the prosthesis that enables it—as a tool supplementing the imposed thanness of the body. The very more-thanness of pure plastic rhythm must come to the fore. We must move beyond the prosthetic as an external category toward an exploration of the originary technicity that technogenesis taps into.
