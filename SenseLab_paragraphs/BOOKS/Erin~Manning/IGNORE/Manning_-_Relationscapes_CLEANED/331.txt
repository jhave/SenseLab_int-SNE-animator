The issue of intensive magnitude (multiplicity in duration) versus extensive magnitude (quantitative multiplicity) is akin to the question of divisible and indivisible movement in Bergson. When movement is counted, and when its counts are considered equal to one another in both form and content, it is rendered divisible by the fact of its being pulled out from its previous durational indivisibility. This is necessary for all quantitative research. The difference between positivism and radical empiricism is not necessarily to do with the act of counting (radical empiricism can also seek results) but with the issue of how the point of departure is conceived. Whereas positivism begins with the divisible number as a given, radical empiricism works from the premise of relationality that foregrounds the indivisibility of duration (as pure experience). When radical empiricism counts, it begins in the middle (milieu). “We must distinguish between the unity as experienced and the unity which we set up as an object after having thought of it, as also between number in process of formation and number once formed. The unit is irreducible while we are thinking it and number is discontinuous while we are building it up: but, as soon as we consider number in its finished state, we objectify it, and it then appears to be divisible to an unlimited extent” (Bergson 1910, 83).
