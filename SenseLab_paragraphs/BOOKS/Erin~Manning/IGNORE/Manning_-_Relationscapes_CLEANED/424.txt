Boccioni writes: “Let’s split open our figures and place the environment inside them!” (1970b, 63). The commanding form of a work makes felt the effects of the virtual by making the inside-out of a work felt. Work becomes environmental, no longer distinct from the “where” of its taking form. The environment becomes embedded in the work, foregrounding new centers of activity through which the work continues to evolve. This evolution is less an actual taking-form than a virtual shape-shifting that alters the qualitative dimensions of what an image or a work can do to shift with and through time. From content to line of force. This is what Boccioni means. Make the environment “part of the plastic whole” (1970a, 18). Not environments of but environments with: worlds for the taking whose force lines produces infinite surfaces that fold, drawing out not the form as such but its potential for transformation.
