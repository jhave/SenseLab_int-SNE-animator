The biogram makes itself felt in the intensive passage from one intensity— one series—to another. This shift is never a passive transition that leaves two series intact. It is a transmutation, the biogram the virtual node between the series. The biogram carries the movement of the event even before the event has expressed itself as such. The biogram cannot represent anything because it has no pregiven form. It creates out of the plane of consistency that it preempts. It is diagrammatic because it has not yet determined its function. It resides on the plane of consistency because this is the plane of incipient relationality. The biogram propels a process of determining that always resists final form. It is a relational concept that operates at once from within the series and at the edges of its deterritorialization.
