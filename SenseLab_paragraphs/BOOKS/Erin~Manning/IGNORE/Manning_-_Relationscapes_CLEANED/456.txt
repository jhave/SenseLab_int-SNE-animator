Spriggs’s work invites us to see-with what is not actually there and to movewith the constellation of what we’re beginning to see. Moving-with perception composing itself, we experience the dynamics of form. We no longer simply observe—we are moved by the experience of watching, and we move with it. We note the contours but feel the colors. We see the lines but feel the rhythm. We see-with the becoming-work. We participate in the activity of plastic dynamism expressing itself through the emergence of a body-sculpture constellation. Plastic dynamism is not simply about how we see an object but also about how an object appears for our embodied perception: “Plastic dynamism is the simultaneous action of the motion characteristic of an object (its absolute motion), mixed with the transformation which the object undergoes in relation to its mobile and immobile environment (its relative motion)” (Boccioni 1970a, 92). Entropy (2007). Look at it and feel its force. Your eyes refuse to focus. Even when you try to see the distinctness of form, what you see is blurriness—the becoming-form’s absolute motion.
