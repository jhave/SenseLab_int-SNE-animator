“Whatever terminates that chain was, because it now proves itself to be, what the concept ‘had in mind’” (James 1912, 58). The terminus is not what you think you knew, not the idea you thought you had, not the way you expected to express yourself—it is a movement of thought pulled forth from the relations of tension that make up the passage from prearticulation to the concept to enunciation. Expressibility is the terminus of a thought in motion, its incipient directionality: the terminus is rarely where you thought it would be. The terminus is a relational nexus that forces thought to take form. Lodged neither in the human nor in the object, thought propels creativity as the activity of the in-between that makes relation felt, activating the “how” of the event, inciting inquiry, curiosity, play.
