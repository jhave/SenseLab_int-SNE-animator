What comes next is magical: the image snaps into a quickness, a wispy lightness as the women’s weight shifts onto the tips of their fingers. This is how the image unfolds: the infinitely heavy upper bodies are held by the women’s arms through a close-up accentuating the weight on a woman’s tensed wrist. We feel the weight of the waiting physically as we watch. When the dancers suddenly lift palm to fingernails, the affective tone lifts perceptibly. We feel an intake of breath, as much our own as theirs, as we watch the bodies morph into weightlessness. The camera is not there only for the recording; it feels-with the bodies’ shifting tonalities.
