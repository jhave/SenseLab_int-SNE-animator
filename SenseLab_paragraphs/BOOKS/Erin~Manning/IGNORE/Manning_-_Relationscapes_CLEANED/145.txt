Every new interval is the virtual node of that actual occasion. As the elasticity of the curvature makes itself felt, we feel the completion of what Whitehead calls the subjective form of the event. The actualization of the subjective form marks the almost-perishing of that actual occasion because it satisfies the event. Satisfaction occurs when the event has fulfilled itself and is ready to be backgrounded into the nexus of perished actual occasions.
