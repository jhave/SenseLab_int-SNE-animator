Take a later image of Riefenstahlâ€™s: the Nuba woman, black, statuesque, glossy, photographed against a blue blue sky, captured slightly from below. This is another instance of the extraordinary physical transcendentalism with which Riefenstahl creates and out of which no straightforward disciplinary or state racism can be delineated. There is a racism, I believe, but one that is immanent to the becoming-image, to a space-time without predetermination, a racism active on the biopolitical plane of populations, affective tones, and compositional series. What emerges: a becoming-multiple of the body that does not normativize a body before calling for its physical transcendence.
