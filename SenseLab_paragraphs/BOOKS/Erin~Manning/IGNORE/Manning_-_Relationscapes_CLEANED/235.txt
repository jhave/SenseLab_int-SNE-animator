Novelty—or creativity—occurs always in the present: novelty emerges through the time-slip between reality and appearance. Because the present takes form on the threshold of appearance and reality, the present must be conceptualized as operating in the midst of the virtual becoming actualized. Prehension catalyzes reality into the movement toward appearance. Reality contributes to appearance by bringing experiential pastness into the present. This experiential pastness transduced into the present brings a certain preexperience to the event of perception. Whitehead calls this aspect of perception causal efficacy in order to remind us that what we perceive first is not an object but how it worlds. This causal aspect of perception is the directly perceived relation between objectness and experience. Activating perception means activating the relation that underlies the object’s very capacity to be perceived. As outlined in the previous chapter, causal efficacy is the active link between objectness and experience that allows the object to take form experientially.
