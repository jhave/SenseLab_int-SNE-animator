The chaos that measure attempts to colonize is what rhythm feeds on: “From chaos, Milieus and Rhythms are born” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 313). Chaos is not the opposite of order. What we experience—the event of force taking form—is always prehended from a certain quasi chaos: the indeterminacy of the not-yet-actual. As the virtual passes into the actual, in this in-between passage where force begins to take form, a chaos of incorporeality can be felt. This chaos is the intensive magnitude of potential. Positivist science seeks to overlay potential with order, imposing measure from the outside. Radical empiricism works from the quasi chaos of the not-yet, beginning in the rhythmic middle of a becoming event. As the events reach what Whitehead calls their subjective form—their completion or concrescence—the quasi chaos of their taking-form is overlaid by the factness of their completion. But events always in some sense remain invested with this quasi chaos, for they have been prehended from the indeterminacy of the forces that compose them. This indeterminacy is a living aspect of the event. It is what rhythm feeds on.
