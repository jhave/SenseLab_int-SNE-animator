A concept takes form at the threshold of expression. It cannot be defined according to categories of judgment. Judgment is a theory of coherence “concerned with a conformity of two components within one experience” (Whitehead 1929/1978, 191). The concept does not judge or evaluate the work: it values the work’s rhythmic pressure. The concept is a gear-shift mechanism that acts on blocks of sensation, oscillating between thought and articulation. It pulsates between the actual and virtual realms. On the virtual stratum, concepts propel the becoming-event of thought: they feel its force. On the plane of composition, concepts articulate the dynamic form of prearticulation: they express the feeling of force. Concepts make multiple sense. “There is no event, no phenomenon, word, or thought which does not have multiple sense. . . . A thing has as many senses as there are forces capable of taking possession of it” (Deleuze 1993, 4).
Concepts appear as the force of expression in its incipiency. We feel a concept in the making when we are on the verge of expression but cannot yet quite articulate the passage from feeling to language. Conceptual work does not happen in already articulated language: it takes form in language’s prearticulation.
