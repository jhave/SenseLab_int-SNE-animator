Diagrams give value to thought in the making. Valuation orients thought, proposing it as a concept for future thinking. It is integral to the process of an actual occasion taking form, but is felt as such only in the eventâ€™s final satisfaction. With this satisfaction comes an inclination toward determinate expression. The process of valuation self-selects tendencially, leading the event toward certain areas of potential on the thought-world nexus. Each valuation adds a singular resonance to the nexus and becomes a potential for other actual occasions to take form, inflecting novelty into the world.
