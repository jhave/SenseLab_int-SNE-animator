What is calculated in the mapping is experience + ability. If you ask Clifford Possum about distance, he will speak in terms of walking days, or car hours. How do I get there? The “how” of directionality creates a permutation such that space-time shapes itself around continuous shiftings. The ground trembles. The desert is not one space: it is many overlapping space-times of experience that Aboriginals call Dreamings. These Dreamings can be drawn into maps, but such maps will never lead us anywhere if we expect them to do the walking for us.
