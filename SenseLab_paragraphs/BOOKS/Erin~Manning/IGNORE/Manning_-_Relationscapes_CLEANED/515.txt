Deleuze speaks of marks made accidentally. These accidental marks are freeâ€” free of the medium, free of the context of their representation. They are not unconscious but hyperconscious. They are marks out of which new concepts are born. To watch Kngwarreye paint is to watch a woman dancing, her whole body engaged in the act, the plane of composition emerging directly from her shoulder along the elbow, wrist held firmly, both hands involved.110 She was not a writing woman: she was a dancing woman, her wrists taut with the activity of reaching-toward and moving-with. Her paintings reflect this force of movement-with through the wholeness of the emergent line or dot, through the becoming-form of the body-land-canvas.
