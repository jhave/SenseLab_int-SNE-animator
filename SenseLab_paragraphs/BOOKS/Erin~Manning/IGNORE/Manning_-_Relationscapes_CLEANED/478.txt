This is not a premapping of experience. Prehending the Dreaming, paintings such as Alhalkere feel the resonance of all that Dreaming can do, drawing its eventness onto the canvas. Transversally political, these paintings call forth a new way of feeling seeing, a seeing-with that moves the body. This elicited movement-with is affective: its tonality (its modalities, its resonances, its textures) alters both what a body can do and how the world can be experienced (Whitehead 1933, 176). To experience Alhalkere is to feel the recomposition of a living landscape that is not separate from the perception of perception that recomposes us. Alhalkere is the Dreaming insofar as it incurs concern for the event that is the shape-shifting of experience. Moving-with its own eventful becoming, Alhalkere is a metastable system that cannot be thought outside the experiential field it opens. Touching (with) us, Alhalkere asks that we have concern for the Dreaming.
