Consider . . . the repetition of a decorative motif: a figure is reproduced, while the concept remains absolutely identical. . . . However, this is not how artists proceed in reality. They do not juxtapose instances of the figure, but rather each time combine an element of one instance with another element of a following instance. They introduce a disequilibrium into the dynamic process of contraction, an instability, dissymmetry or gap of some kind which disappears only in the overall effect. (Deleuze 1994, 19)
Marey’s process of repetition and difference leads to transductions where movement machines become movements of thought, which in turn become machinic perceptions. Just as his ten seagulls flying is an intimate conjunctive play of what air and bird can become, his machines are associated milieus through which previously unthinkable assemblages take form. The machine becomes the event for the next rendition of movement’s elastic curvature, a technique for the co-constitution of the technique-feeling-thought series that is the foundation of experimentation.
