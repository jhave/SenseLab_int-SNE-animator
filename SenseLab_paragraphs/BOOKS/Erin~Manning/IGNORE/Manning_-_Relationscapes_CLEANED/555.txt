Napangardi would never purposefully evoke a Dreaming not hers to tell. That strands of Dreamings emerge ontogenetically within tellings of adjacent stories emphasizes the inherent fact of relationality that is at the heart of Dreamings as a whole. In her evocation of the Karntakurlangu Jukurrpa (2000b), Napangardi does not tell the story of the snake’s rape, and yet its presence within the larger Dreaming nexus seems to taint her Dreaming. The force of the eternal return of the Dreaming seems to be felt in Karntakurlangu Jukurrpa (2000b). This feeling is not a narrative that seeks to tell a missing part of a story. It is a force for the telling that is violent in its expression.
In Napangardi’s evocation of the Karntakurlangu Dreaming in Karntakurlangu Jukurrpa (2000b), what is also noteworthy is the recuperative power of the violence. This is not reactive force personalized, resentfully reclaiming the past in an act of ressentiment. It is a future-taking of the present, a reaching-toward creation.
