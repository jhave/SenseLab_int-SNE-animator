In Riefenstahl the body becomes “an involuntary medium for the expression of thought” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 85). The movement of thought Riefenstahl creates around becoming-bodies foreshadows a new aesthetic that is immanently political in its consequences. Riefenstahl is right to say she does not stage ideological political encounters. Her politics are not of the ready-made kind. They are affective politics. Through the shifting biograms of her work on the body-becoming, Riefenstahl opens politics to affects that resonate through bodies not unlike contemporary political tendencies. Such affective politics draw from certain aspects of fascism, but are much more powerful in their creation and mobilization of images than is Hitler’s so-called fascist aesthetic. Unlike Hitler’s aesthetic, the affective politics in Riefenstahl’s work do not have to concern themselves directly with disciplining the elusive body. Riefenstahl creates (with) affect. She creates with affect’s incipient movement. Riefenstahl thus creates a becoming-body that transcends its simple location, continuously moving toward an infinity of recombination. Conjunctively, biogrammatically, Riefenstahl creates the ultimate body without organs. Pure plastic rhythm.
