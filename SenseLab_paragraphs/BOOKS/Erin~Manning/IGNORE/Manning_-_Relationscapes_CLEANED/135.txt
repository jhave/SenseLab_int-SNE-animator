Relational movement produces a curve or curvature. The elasticity is felt more than seen. It is an intensive curve that was never led as such, because created relationally. The law of curvature is the law of folds, and folds have a tendency to refold, to pleat, to crease, to wrinkle. As the fold compresses, what results is not necessarily a smaller movement but a more intensively compact one. This compactness produces a force that opens the movement to its taking-form. The curve does not result from the movement. The curve is the movement, a contraction into an elasticity that moves the relation. The body-elastic is pure plastic rhythm, the body of the between where the movement is on the verge, quasi-actual, almost virtual, hanging, pulsing, spiraling.
