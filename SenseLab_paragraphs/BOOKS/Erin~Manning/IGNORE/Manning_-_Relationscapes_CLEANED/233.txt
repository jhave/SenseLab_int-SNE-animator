This virtual nexus is how Whitehead defines reality. As the actual occasion perishes to give way to the next actual occasion, the actual occasion melds into a reality virtually populated by all of the positive (having been actualized) and negative (having remained inactivated or virtual) prehensions that make up our experiential worlds. This nexus of perished actual occasions—reality—can be conceived as a wealth of potential out of which possible worlds emerge. Reality is therefore always more than and less than appearance: less than what appearance can be, and more than what appearance is. To be experienced, reality must be activated. Even then, it is not strictly “what it was” but “how it can become.”
