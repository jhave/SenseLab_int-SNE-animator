To look at Marey’s photographs is to feel them. Feeling is an amodal experience that is a passing-between of sense-modes. Perception is constituted by feeling-tones. Perception lures feeling, coalescing visual experience into a force of feeling. Affectively, feeling works on the body, bringing to the fore the experiential force of the quasi chaos of the not-quite-seen. This not-quite is the quality of potential we perceive in many of Marey’s movement images.70 These images do not represent movement, they move-with the movement of the feeling taking form. They are affective because to see is to feel-with, to participate in the intensive passage from the virtual to actualization. What is amodally felt, perceived-with, is the microperceptual appearing at the threshold of sight, but not actually seen. Working at the limit of a body’s capacity to actualize, this perceiving-with affectively reworks what a body can do.
