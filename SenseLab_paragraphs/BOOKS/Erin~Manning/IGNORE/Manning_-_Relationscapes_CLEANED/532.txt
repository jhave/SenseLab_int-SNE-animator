Digging sticks (Karlangu) are strongly associated with Warlpiri women in Aboriginal culture and are used to dig for yams, goannas, witchetty grubs, and other bush foods. They are also used in the culture for making shelter, fighting, and funeral ceremonies. Napangardi’s investment in the digging sticks is twofold. On the one hand, the Dreaming for which she is custodian is intricately linked with the digging sticks. Her work depends on their integration as part of the story she tells. And yet her use of the digging sticks is singular. She also uses them as a technology of movement: she paints dots as though digging with the sticks through the earth. This usage of the digging sticks as a technique for painting sets her slightly apart from the tradition of dot-paintings that emerged in Australia around the 1970s.112 Where many painters used the dots as quasi-representational devices (figuring campsites, waterholes, etc.), Napangardi’s focus is on a technique for digging, a tool for making dots. Before she paints content, Napangardi paints technique.
