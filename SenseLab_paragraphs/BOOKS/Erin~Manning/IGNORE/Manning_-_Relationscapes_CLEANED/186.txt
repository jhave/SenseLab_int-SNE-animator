Not so with post-encephalitic patients. Nothing can make them think their way from absolute movement to displacement. Perception has been damaged such that a thought gets them nowhere. Rose R. explains: Whatever I do or whatever I think leads deeper and deeper into itself. . . . Everything I do is a map of itself, everything I do is a part of itself, every part leads into itself. . . . I’ve got a thought in my mind, and then I see something in it, like a dot on the skyline. It comes nearer and nearer, and then I see what it is—it’s just the same thought I was thinking before. And then I see another dot, and another, and so on. . . . Or I think of a map; then a map of that map, and each map is perfect, though smaller and smaller. . . . Worlds within worlds within worlds. . . . Once I get going I can’t possibly stop. It’s like being caught between mirror, or echoes, of something. Or being caught in a merry-go-round which won’t come to a stop. (qtd. in Sacks 1990, 76n54)
