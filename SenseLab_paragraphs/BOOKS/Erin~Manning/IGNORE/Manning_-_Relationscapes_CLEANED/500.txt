Almost immediately after beginning to paint, Kngwarreye’s paintings were cast among the great works of the twentieth century, lauded as some of the most important landscape art ever produced. Margo Neale writes: “Kngwarreye was arguably Australia’s greatest painter of the ‘landscape.’ No artist has painted the country the way she has, inflecting it with her personal vision and innovative style. . . . Hers is not a view of the law, but rather an experience of it. She rescales the landscape to a cosmic dimension—more akin to the holistic landscape of the Aboriginal mind” (1998, 31).
