This extensive-intensive relation is felt everywhere in Napangardi’s work. It is a tension alive in the lines she carves into the canvas through the digging-stick dots. In Karntakurlangu Jukurrpa (2000c), measuring 122 x 122 cm, this tension is foregrounded. Another square painting (in its dimensions), Karntakurlangu Jukurrpa (2000c) evokes a complex surface of dots becoming-squares unbecoming-squares, the tone a rust color with white on a black background. This painting makes the force of the landscape’s curvature felt. Along the edges, the squares are quite uniform, but as they begin to merge toward the middle, the dotted lines seem to bend. The activity of the squares’ deformation is the event of the work. This intensive becoming-topological of the painting’s folding surface draws the gaze to the left-of-center of the canvas, where the squares seem to recede to make space for the painting’s eventual deformation. Here, the painting’s becoming-form pulsates. The dynamic encounter is not between background and foreground but between curve and line, making felt a qualitative transmutation that morphs the painting from its squareness toward an intensive infinity of infolding. This diagrammatic infolding is less a shape than a feeling of force pushing into the painting’s insistent deformation. The collapse of Euclidean geometry is felt as the tension of topological undoing. Force fights form, exposing the inner relations of tension in the becoming-landscape’s curvature.
