Concern for the Dreaming is an ethics of encounter with the unknowable— an event in the making—that far exceeds the specificity of a particular piece of land. This is not to dismiss the importance of land claims in Aboriginal politics, nor to romanticize space as ephemeral. It is to take the immanent materiality of the Dreamings seriously and to note that what paintings such as Alhalkere do exceeds the parameters of their landmarks. Their concern is for the embodied eventness of land, not a predetermined location. It is not based on an identity politics that would promote an exclusive dialectics of inside/outside. Experience itself is at stake, in the making. The fluidity of experience of paintings such as Alhalkere does not limit itself to preinformed historical circumstances. It is radically empirical: it is an invitation to invent with the unspeakable, the imperceptible, the as-yet-unfelt. “Dreaming stories and ‘icons’ [do] justice to the force and effect of these paintings in the material terms they themselves effect” (Biddle 2003, 61).94 The immanent materiality of these paintings calls forth an empiricism that is directly experienced, that is directly relational. And that is how they reach me, 10,000 miles away.
