Marey’s work can be seen as engaging actively in the study of movement as divisible (quantitative measure) and as indivisible (duration). Different kinds of numberings produce different results. As Marey’s work demonstrates, both the quantitative and the qualitative are necessary for the invention of new processes for experimentation. While Marey only chooses to give academic credence to one aspect of his method, the intensive magnitude felt in his visual results definitely seems to play a role in the subsequent designing of new techniques for measurement.
