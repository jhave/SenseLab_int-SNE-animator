The radical empiricism of Marey’s  machinic  experimentation  can  be felt in his continual reinvention of techniques not only for the capturing of movement-passing but for its ghostly evocation in its various quasi-chaotic states of becoming. William James defines radical empiricism as “an empiricism [that] must neither admit into its constructions any element that is not directly experienced, nor exclude from them any element that is directly experienced” (1912, 42). For James, radical empiricism is radical because it begins with the actually imperceptible—relation—and asks how relation produces events of knowledge. In radical empiricism, there is nothing prior to direct experience, and no way to work outside of experience’s incipient relationality. “For such a philosophy, the relations that connect experiences must themselves be experienced relations, and any kind of relation experienced must be accounted as ‘real’ as anything else in the system” (James 1912, 42). In Deleuzian terms, this means that what is foregrounded is not the object, the word, the concept but the assemblage through which ecologies of practice emerge.71 This process of assembling is never individual—it is collective. Speaking of enunciation as an assemblage, Deleuze explains, “The utterance is the product of an assemblage—which is always collective, which brings into play within us and outside us populations, multiplicities, territories, becomings, affects, events” (Deleuze and Parnet 1987, 51). Radical empiricism experiments with assemblages such as the associated milieu, an environmental in-between that never preexists the force of its taking form. “This is assembling: being in the middle, on the line of encounter between an internal world and an external world” (Deleuze and Parnet 1987, 52).
