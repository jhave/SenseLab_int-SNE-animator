Baggs creates relational nexuses that expose the world at the incipience of its sensory becoming. This sensory becoming is a form of thought. Articulation of that thought implies restricting the complexity of thoughts’ prearticulation to a content-based structure of expression. Baggs resists this simplification, opting not against words but for relational complexity. Baggs explains: Far from being purposeless, the way that I move is an ongoing response to what is around me. Ironically, the way that I move when responding to everything around me is described as “being in a world of my own,” whereas if I interact with a much more limited set of responses and only react to a much more limited part of my surroundings people claim that I am “opening up to true interaction with the world.” In My Language elaborates the sensory experience of thought’s immanent prearticulation. It feels the world, thinking with it, rather than simply speaking of it. “But my language is not about designing words or even visual symbols for people to interpret. It is about being in a constant conversation with every aspect of my environment, reacting physically to all parts of my surroundings.”
