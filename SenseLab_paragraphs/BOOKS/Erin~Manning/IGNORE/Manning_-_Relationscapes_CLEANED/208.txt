Sacks:    But how can you possibly think of nothing?
Rose: It’s dead easy, once you know how. . . . One way is to think about the same thing again and again. Like 2=2=2=2; or, I am what I am what I am what I am . . . It’s the same thing with my posture. My posture continually leads to itself. Whatever I do or whatever I think leads deeper and deeper into itself. (Sacks 1990, 76n54)
Without symbolic reference, experience empties. It is not only nothing: it feels like nothing.
