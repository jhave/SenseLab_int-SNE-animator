Frances D.’s space-striators awaken her to the complexity of space striating, triggering causal efficacy: their “tiny whiteness” immediately “incite” or “command” her to take the next step (Sacks 1990, 63). But these striators by themselves do not cause her to move. They create the conditions for the relation movement-body-space to rejig into activation. This propels into motion the inertia that is beginning to set in, transducing absolute movement into preacceleration into displacement. Space striators are techniques for moving through movement for those who have lost their capacity to world. They can take the form of music, a loud-ticking watch, horizontal lines drawn on the floor, balls thrown, an obstacle course, a boulder, stairs. Anything that intercepts the seeming emptiness of smooth space potentially works. Because to freeze, according to Lillian T., is “to freeze in empty spaces” (Sacks 1990, 63n47).
