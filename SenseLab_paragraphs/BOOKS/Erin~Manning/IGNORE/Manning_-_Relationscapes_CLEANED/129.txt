It is not simply the speed of the movement that keeps form from holding to a step. It is incipient movementâ€™s wave, of which the elastic is the emergent force. As the wave forms, we feel an interval creating itself. Through the interval, we feel the elasticity, the becoming-form of a relational movement. This is a microperception, active only in transition, at the cusp of the actual. As the elasticity compresses, the impetus for becoming-form is infinite. But if we lose it by allowing its intensity to disperse, or if we want to hold onto it for too long, the elastic point of the movement will evaporate and only the step will be felt.
