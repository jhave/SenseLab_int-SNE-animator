Thought prehends prearticulations from the complex nexus that is the world in motion. Prearticulation is the preacceleration of language: it is where language’s affective tonality comes to expression. The world in motion is made up of planes of experience. The passage from the plane of sensation to the plane of articulation, a movement toward the actual from the virtual stratum, depends on thought’s capacity to extract from the virtual quasi chaos of experience’s potential unfolding. This extraction is a kind of editing of the nexus.
