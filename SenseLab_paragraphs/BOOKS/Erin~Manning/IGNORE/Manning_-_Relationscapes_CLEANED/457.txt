Flatten your gaze, and what you feel is the relative motion of Entropy’s force. You feel its spiral as a centrifugal rhythm. You see the droplets of water as they recombine with the force of Entropy’s movement. You find it impossible to stand still. You move to the side, to where the sheets of Mylar themselves begin to curve. The animate form follows your movement moving: you realize your vision has curved in the process of feeling the force of the rhythm’s contours. You see rhythm contouring.
