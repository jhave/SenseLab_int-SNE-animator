Baggs’s finger plays in the stream of running water. She speaks—her speech delivered by a voice synthesizer: “In this part of the video, the water doesn’t symbolize anything. I am just interacting with the water as the water interacts with me.” Language does not replace the sensual exploration of the relational environment: it moves with it, becoming one more technique for composition. For Baggs, communication through words remains inadequate to the singular experiences of sensation the world calls forth. Words are an extra component of the experience of articulation, not its final form. Words, Baggs suggests, cannot fully express experience’s complexity. Her “translation” must therefore evoke more than the manifestation of words. It must transduce the event of language’s becoming-with sensation. Language must be called forth as a layering-with of the affective tonality of expression.
