Landing sites flock experience into a univocity. They are singular and multiple at once. In the scene with the heads slowly moving to the floor, the landing site is both a certain quality of hardness as well as a grounding of weightlessness. The siting of ground is also a landing into thin air—“even a mere intimation of a singling-out equals having landed on and sited” (Arakawa and Gins 2002, 10–11).
