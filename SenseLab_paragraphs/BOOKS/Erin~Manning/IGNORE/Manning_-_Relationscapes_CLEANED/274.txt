“A ‘relation’ between occasions is an eternal object illustrated in the complex of mutual prehensions by virtue of which those occasions constitute a nexus” (Whitehead 1929/1978, 194). The sharing of qualities opens the world to relational potential. Each event is contemporarily independent from all other events even as it holds within itself—via its infinite foldings—the potential to create an associated milieu. This associated milieu does not change the actual form of the occasion, but it does alter its resonance. It foregrounds a quality that would otherwise be backgrounded. These kinds of mutual prehensions give life to the already-quasi-formed, emphasizing the capacity for morphing inherent in all events of the future-past.
