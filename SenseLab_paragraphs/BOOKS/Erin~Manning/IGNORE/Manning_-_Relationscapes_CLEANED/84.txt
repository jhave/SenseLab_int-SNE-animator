Novelty is produced by the body-becoming. Novelty is dynamic, active through the plasticity of its rhythms, emergent always in excess of its form. “You make a voluntary decision, and you let yourself move into space and then gravity and velocity and several other factors are going to affect that decision and force you into another one” (Forsythe 2003a, 24). The interval cannot be shaped as such. It creates a folding into which bodies capitulate, an opening into which we surge. Bodies become many-timed, many-spaced: “Then your body would take over and dance at that point where you had no more idea. I see that as an idealized form of dancing: just not knowing and letting the body dance you around” (Forsythe 2003, 26).
