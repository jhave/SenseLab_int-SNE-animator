“The veritable perfecting of machines, that which we can say elevates the degree of technicity of a machine, corresponds not to a production of the automatism, but on the contrary opens up a margin of indetermination within the machine itself ” (Simondon 1969, 11). The dynamic ground out of which Marey’s work evolves is an associated milieu for the rethinking of the rift between the sensuous and the non-sensuous, between the sensing experience of the present-passing and the non-sensuous future-feltness of the past. Each of Marey’s experiments evolves out this dynamism. The processes for vision he creates are platforms for relation for the perception of perception. Perception becomes machinic in the sense that it is no longer a stable given in the process of exploring movement, but itself becomes a milieu through which experimentation takes place. In the exploration of margins of indetermination for the machinism of perception, what Marey continuously foregrounds is the imperative to make the machine sensitive to change. From experiments of movement to experiments with movement, Marey’s work begins to foreground how perception fields the relation between incipiency and displacement.
