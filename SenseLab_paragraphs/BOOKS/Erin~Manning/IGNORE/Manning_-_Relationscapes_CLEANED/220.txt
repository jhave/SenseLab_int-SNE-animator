In a situation where the dance modulates sound and image in real time based on extrinsic movements of a dancing body, attention tends to shift from the qualitative to the quantitative. Because of the system’s prosthetic apparatus and its emphasis on subjecting the dancing body to its predefined parameters, the participant’s attention tends to be drawn to the workings of the system rather than to the movement’s microperceptual qualities. We catch not the dancer’s preacceleration in its present-passing, but the ways in which her movement stimulates a transformation of the video image. We want to know when and how the music is modulated and due to which kind of displacement. We watch the dancer for this shift, trying to locate the specificities of the technology and its gestural syntax. This concern for the technology soon situates the dancing body on the techno-dance stage as a preformed organism onto which the technology is grafted. The question shifts from “what can a body do” to “what can technology do.” This experience of the dance performance is directly related to the limits of the system. The body movement is reduced to bits. Gestures become data for technology rather than contributing to movement’s experiential wholeless. Attention is distracted from the subtleties of pure plastic rhythm. What stands out is actualized displacement in the service of the software.
