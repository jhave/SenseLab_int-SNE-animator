The teachings that allow us to conceive of landscapes as perspectival entities operational in space-time are in the main Euclidean. In Euclidean geometry, we know one space from another not primarily by the ways in which our bodies create that space but by the ways in which we inhabit or enter it. Space becomes a container for experience. By privileging inhabitation (where space always preexists experience), Euclidean geometry enables a rendering-abstract of space, abstract in the sense that it is empty before the arrival of content to fill it. Because of this abstraction of space, what is measured in Euclidean geometry is considered concrete: space is abstract, bodies and landscapes are concrete. Body and space are not one, co-determining: they are always two, 1 + 1, body + space. It is due to this linear grammar of geometry that the colonizer is able to assert that seemingly empty space is uninhabited.
