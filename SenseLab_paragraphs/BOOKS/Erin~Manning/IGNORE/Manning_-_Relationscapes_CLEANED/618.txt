Feeling is a pulsion to think, a sensitivity that situates thought in the world: through feeling, thoughtâ€™s affective tonality is foregrounded. Feeling is affect bleeding into thought, activating complexities on the verge of expression. At the threshold of thought as creation, feeling provokes an aperture for that which has not yet been thought. Thought is a lure for feeling that prearticulates the virtual inflections of its incipient expression.
