But this is not the only kind of numbering, nor is it the only counting at work in Mareyâ€™s experiments. Marey also works with intensive magnitudes, where what is numbered is individuation rather than self-identity. When the trapezoid moves through the smoke, it qualitatively alters the shape of the trapezoid, the smoke filaments, and the air in the surrounding environment. It creates atmosphere, altering the experience of space-time. The counting here is not a quantification of elements. The air can only be known in its transformation. What is measured is as much beauty or feeling as it is shape. This is a transductive operation, whereby different endurances take hold, inviting different kinds of processes to take form.
