Diagrams are prearticulations of thought in motion. They foreground the work’s elastic points, its tendencies. Like biograms, which express the virtual node through which a body becomes, they are nodal points around which the future of thought’s exfoliation circulates. They make the elasticity of the almost felt, exfoliating the work’s potential across its shifting surface. Diagrams move thought, inviting the conceptual escape of “the action of invisible forces on the body” (Deleuze 2003, 36). Diagrams rhythmically call forth the relation thought-expression.
