A dancing ground is a technogenetic element in the dance. A technique of composition, the ground becomes a condition of emergence for the ontogenetic body. Techniques conceived this way are technologies composed with, for, and through a dancing body. They foreground the more-thanness of pure plastic rhythm. Grounding is a key aspect of technique: even without being told, the dancer learns to continuously relocate the ground as an element of experimental space-time, creating momentum with and through the ground toward gravity-defying re-vectorization.
