Marey’s machines are techniques of relation. As open systems, they do not simply measure preconstituted bodies moving, they invent techniques of relation for the creation of becoming-bodies of movement. Marey’s machines produce margins of indeterminacy that call forth new machinic processes. How we see what we sense is Marey’s main concern, resulting in a generative practice of creating assemblages that generate open passages between sensing bodies and machines: an ecology of practices.
