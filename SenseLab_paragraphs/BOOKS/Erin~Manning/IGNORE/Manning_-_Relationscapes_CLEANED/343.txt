Although his research on birds did not ultimately lead Marey closer to creating a flying machine, it did invigorate his work on movement, producing some of the most extraordinary photographs of his career. In 1883, with the help of a photographic gun (a precursor to his chronophotographic apparatus), which revolves at different speeds on a stable axis, Marey deepened his research on the movements of birds. The series he eventually develops out of these experiments is well known, entitled Flight of the Seagull: 25 Images per Second (1887). Later sculpted in bronze (see earlier image), this series is particularly remarkable in its ability to bring to life the intensive passage from form to force. Working with gliding, Mareyâ€™s experiments become explorations of the force fields inherent in the intensive relational movement of flying. Intensive movement is key, he thinks, to understanding how gliding relates to the flight of the bird. Perhaps it is best not to study the movements of the wings themselves but to explore how the air moves around the bird? This transition in his experimentation to the study of the movement of gases will take another decade to come to fruition.
