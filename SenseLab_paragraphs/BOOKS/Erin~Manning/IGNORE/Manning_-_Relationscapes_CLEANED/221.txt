Such a dance-event is typical of many of those situated at the nexus of dance and new technologies.40 In such cases, technological experimentation involves a body whose movements trigger a system that can read certain kinds of displacements and translate them. These technological systems operate prosthetically and are often attached to the human body. They operate on the basis of the more-than, “enhancing” a dancing body’s capacity to create space-times of experience. These dance/new technology experiments emphasize how digital technology can foreground previously untapped dimensions of the moving body, creating a body that is sensually emergent, alive with image and sound. But are these new technologies really opening up the body to its technogenetic potential? Can the vocabulary of the prosthetic re-generate the moving body toward sense modalities otherwise untapped?
