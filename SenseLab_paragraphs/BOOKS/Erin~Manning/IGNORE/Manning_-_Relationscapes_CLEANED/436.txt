Riefenstahl produces not specific politics or bodies as such but milieus of potential. The biograms she foregrounds are rhythmically created in an architectonic of audiovision where the sound never precedes the image, and where affective tone takes precedence over content. This is even the case in her editing: when Riefenstahl creates a work, she catalogues the film not strictly according to content but according to what she calls “atmosphere.” Riefenstahl inscribes rhythm directly into the process of editing, already emphasizing in the precomposition phase the image’s skyness, its laughter or sadness, its darkness. The protagonists in Riefenstahl’s films are affective tone, lines of force, polyrhythms. Her techniques are never created outside or in addition to the body in movement. Her shots are events.
