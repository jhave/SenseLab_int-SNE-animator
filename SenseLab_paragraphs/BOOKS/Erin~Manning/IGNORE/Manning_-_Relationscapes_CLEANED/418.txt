In this play of appearance/disappearance, the rhythm of the image is interlaced with the marching cadence of the orchestral music. We prehend the scene in quick bursts, our perception of the juxtapositions of various verticalities polyrhythmic. The cadence does not take over: the measure is more than one. The provocation is affective. The audio is not outside: we feel its movement as part of the image’s force. Polyrhythms of appearance-disappearance shift the affective tone of this experience of almost-seeing. Riefenstahl intensifies this affective tone as the scene progresses by alternating rhythmically from Hitler’s body to the military bodies and the crowd. The one-many is achieved through quick succession: the crowd grows in consistency while Hitler’s body defines itself as the locus of singularity.
