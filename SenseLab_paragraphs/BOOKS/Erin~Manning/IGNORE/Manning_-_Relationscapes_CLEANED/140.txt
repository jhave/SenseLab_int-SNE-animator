The elastic point is preemptive. It anticipates curvature. In the becoming-curve of movement, elasticity is always operative, but not always felt as such. Often, this elasticity is curtailed—for example, when a change of direction is fallen into, rather than moved into. But when it is felt, it is experienced as though after its occurrence, an “after” that is copresent with its actualization but feels differed because elastics take time. Elasticity is the durational element in the becoming-curve of movement.
In relational movement, elasticity always produces spirals. Whether these spirals are extensive movements or whether they remain intensive, force is centrifugally recombined with movement moving. The interval becomes intensively relayed with the force of the spiral, creating a turbulence that moves the relation. This can be a quiet, even serene turbulence, a graceful intensity, or it can be a wild, excessive turbulence. Either way, it envelops the contours of the steps, creating a spur, a trace of the line of flight that characterizes the displacement of the moving relation.
