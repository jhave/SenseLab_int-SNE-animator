The solo dancer in Pas de deux dances her own form-taking, her displacements soon no longer discernable as such. Foregrounding the virtual event of movement moving as animate form, McLaren makes the process of force’s contribution to form felt. Incipiency is perceived not in the execution of a movement per se, but in the elastic force of movement’s decomposition, allowing “form to occupy a multiplicity of possible positions continuously within the same form” (Lynn 1999, 10).
