Perception’s force-field is a complex surface of as yet undifferentiated experience. We see not an object but its activity of relation. We see holes: contours, edges, active intervals moving. We feel wholes: experiential duration not yet divided into actual objects. We see not only what we actually look at but what we remember ourselves seeing. What we remember ourselves seeing is actualized through non-sensuous perception, which refers to how an experience of pastness—past seeings—finds its way into our present as a force of potential. It’s not just that we see what we’ve already seen—it’s that what we’ve already seen contaminates what we feel we see and re-composes what we’re actually not seeing.
