In their frozen states, such activators are necessary for post-encephalitic patients. The causal efficacy at the heart of activation seems to have gone missing. While they know how to move, they have no capacity to get moving—they are missing the relational field that brings motion into action. They sense, and yet their sense perceptions seem to know no bounds. Inwardly convulsed within absolute movement, their prehensions of sensa fold into themselves. Neurologically, the “with” seems to be blocked. Without causal efficacy, moving-with the world worlding is impossible.
