In an intimate embrace, our relational walk moves counterclockwise around the dance floor, our bodies beginning to take on the rhythm of the intervals our movement is creating. These intervals—fed by the preacceleration that is the feeling of movement-to-come—are the virtual nodes through which each initiated movement becomes the invitation of a step. In the interval, the direction we’ve chosen gains a texture that encourages the step to fold through movement moving. The complexity of relation translates displacements into open prearticulations. We preaccelerate to prearticulate. Displacement is hardly felt as such. When our bodies begin to fold around the interval, we know we are creating a dance.
