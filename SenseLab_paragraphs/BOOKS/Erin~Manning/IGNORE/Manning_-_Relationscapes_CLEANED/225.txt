The technogenetic body is infinitely more-than, but not within the confines of the prosthetic. It takes the body as pure plastic rhythm. Bringing transduction into the mix means provoking a change not only of state but of dynamic. Nudging a process to a new level suggests making the body-as-event the subject of the composition. This can only occur through an embedding of some kind of analog process into the dimensions of current technologyâ€™s potential.47 The analog is key to this process because unlike the digital, the analog always has virtuality embedded in its open system.
