This first long scene that begins with the rain, with the camera moving through a space that seems to be an endless labyrinth of windows, is a scene heavy with the languor of a relation forming between bodies, ground, and partitioned space. The presence of the camera is felt as though it were another body forcefully moving us to watch, constraining us to see not only a location or a dance but the tensile rhythm of groundedness itself. The camera works with this ground, pulling the dance into its weighted lethargy, into a vibratile exhaustion that is not a mimesis of grounded bodies but emphasizes the groundâ€™s very resonance as a dancing medium.
