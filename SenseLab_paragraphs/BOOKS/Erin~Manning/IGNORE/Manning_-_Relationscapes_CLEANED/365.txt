She moves alone at first. Then, her alone is met with the trace of her movements evaporating. Movement emanates from the poses of her movement stilling, traces of her becoming-movement left behind. And then she leaves the pose of her stilled body to move somewhere else. At different time intervals, the posing body follows her continuing movement, creating a refrain of past movement in future becoming. Soon these traces of the surplus of movement passing begin to take over the apparent stillness, folding through the animationâ€™s dance, landing not into the next pose, but into the surfacing of its disappearance.
