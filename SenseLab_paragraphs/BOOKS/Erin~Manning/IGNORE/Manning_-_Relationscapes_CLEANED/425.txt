The becoming-body in Riefenstahl is a force to be reckoned with, not least of which because it reinvents space-time. It is a force for the future. Certainly, its dynamism remains imbued with the charisma of Hitler’s fascism. Yet it is also more-than: it becomes beyond the boundaries imposed by the era of its inception. It is more dangerous, more powerful, more evocative than what has been called a “fascist body” or an “aesthetic of fascism” because it is infinitely more malleable even than the regime itself. While the regime instantiates rigid planes of organization onto its population, thereby creating a continuous shift between the biopolitical and the disciplinary, Riefenstahl’s bodies barely require the disciplinary. She begins there, certainly, working with the trained bodies of the military and of Olympic athletes, yet departs from their individuality as bodies of a certain time and space toward the creation of a becoming-body of absolute movement. The body she creates is beautiful, but not only in its human dimensions—it is a body-becoming-sky as much as a body-becoming-limbs. It is a plane of consistency of swaying grass opening onto sculptural flesh, the becoming-body emerging in the between. The becoming-body of the not-yet.
