When movement is conceptualized as an add-on to the sculpting of matter— when environment, atmosphere, preexists the sculpture—movement becomes indexical to space. We are left with movement as defined only by the actual bodies taking a stroll around the sculpture. To say that a sculpture moves is to say something entirely different: it is to suggest that form becomes matter in the mattering of form. It is to say that dynamic form is the molecular transduction that creates space rather than inhabiting it, physically transcending matter as precomposed form. Sculptural exfoliation. When the sculpture physically transcends its materiality, it does not become any less material. A becoming-body takes form that is neither strictly sculptural nor strictly physical: physical transcendence.
