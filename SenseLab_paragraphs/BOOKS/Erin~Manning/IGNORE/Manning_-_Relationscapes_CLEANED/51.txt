The elasticity of movement as developed in chapter 2 makes a case for bodies always reconverging around the elasticity of their becoming. Riefenstahl’s work makes this elasticity felt both within and across the frame, opening thought toward the articulation of how movement can also be felt within stillness (within a “still”). Working from a perspective of incipient movement, I explore how force takes form through an elastic movement that is curved through inflection. Inflection is a mathematical concept that demonstrates how lines are moved by nodal points that not only change the line’s direction but also alter the parameters for its mapping. Inflection makes apparent how even a “still” can move as it curves with the force of preacceleration: movement’s elasticity is felt in its curving-through a nodal shift that redirects its force. This nodal shift is movement’s elastic point.
