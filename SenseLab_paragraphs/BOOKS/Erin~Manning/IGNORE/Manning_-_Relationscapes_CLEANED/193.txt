The key to auto-activation is change. To move, we need space-time to appear, to make itself felt as such. The danger of infinite smoothness is precisely that there is no appearance, no “standing out.” Without it, nothing can be felt as such: the field of perception flattens. In this eternal smoothness, what is left is hardly more than the “nothing” of Rose’s “just the same thought as I was thinking before. . . . Worlds within worlds within worlds” (qtd. in Sacks 1990, 76n54).
