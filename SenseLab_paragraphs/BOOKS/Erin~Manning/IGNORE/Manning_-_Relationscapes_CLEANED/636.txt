Not all thought transduces into a concept. Concepts are forces that take form at the junction between the emergence and expressibility of thought. Concepts move-with the force that is the virtual plurality of each incipient event. In conceptual articulation, forces work imperceptibly, and yet their virtual prearticulation can be felt. Concepts emerge in tandem with the forces’ struggle for valuation within the work. The concept is an elastic point in the passage from the virtual—thought—to the actual—articulation. Concepts inflect thought toward expression. Concepts are the points of inflection that move thought toward language.
