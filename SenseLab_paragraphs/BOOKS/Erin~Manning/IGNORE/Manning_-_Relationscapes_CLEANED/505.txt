A second series that stands out is called Untitled. It also comprises six panels, and is made one year earlier, in 1995. The activity of paint is similar here, drawing the background into the foreground, creating a direct perception of the activity of relation felt through the heavy, impatient line. As with Utopia Panels, there is a sense of paint exhausting itself (and the canvas) by the end of the series—as though Kngwarreye’s brushstrokes used all the paint the brush could hold, in one infinite gesture. In this series, the colors range from white to red to yellow, creating a pink-orange-brown-blue-greenness emergent in the mixing of the paint. Again, the lines are danced, materialized from the range accessible from shoulder to hand in a single movement that never dissociates the shoulder from the body: each line moves a body.
The first of the six canvases of Untitled (1995) backgrounds the yellow, creating an almost uniform surface of whitish-pink strokes across, up, and down. These strokes are fierce but relatively constrained, short in length as though staccato, marking the surface without giving in to it. This panel bleeds yellow into the next canvas. The second panel—in shades of white on a brownish yellow-green—is less controlled, mad with layering, a mix of colors that seep into the background, creating a brownish-yellow-green. The lines here are mostly whitish, continuous with the first canvas, but more complex due to the thickness of shades out of which the lines emerge, the background coloring caused, probably, by paint mixing before it dries. This is an impatient canvas, lines of differing widths no longer simply moving across and down but spiraling as well. Unlike the first panel, which seems to be what it proposes, the second panel is disruptive, continuous with the first, and yet disjunctive, thus forcing the body to keep moving toward the next panel.
