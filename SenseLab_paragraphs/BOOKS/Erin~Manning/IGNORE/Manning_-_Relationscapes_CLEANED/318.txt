Marey’s images of the smoke filaments are capsules of intensity that foreground the process of perception taking form. The movement of the air emerges for perception as a graceful dance that couples the outlines of the forms passing through the smoke with the sensation of their passing. We feel the grace of this passage. The future of movement moving feels like it is taking form in the present. To create an experience of the future in the present requires a foregrounding of the immanence of movement within sensation. Grace taking form is not an experience-of but an experience-with that takes on the color of the inquiry even while it invents new uses for it. Weaving novelty into the very act of perception, Marey’s images produce incorporeal becomings, imbuing the experiential process of worlding with the grace of a movement-with that would otherwise remain virtual. Vision curves into its own potential.
