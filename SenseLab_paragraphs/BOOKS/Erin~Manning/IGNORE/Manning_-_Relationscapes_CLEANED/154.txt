The different planes that compose a given movement are like modes. The movement composes itself through each of these modes in its own singular way. When a mode fulfills its process, another mode takes over. In relational movement, modes would include preacceleration, intervals, spirals. The planes of movement are felt in the shifting of preacceleration toward the creation of an interval (moving the relation) through the propelling of a spiral, curving into the elastic point toward the becoming-form of the almost, leading back into preacceleration. Although there is a certain linearity in these modes, it would be a mistake to think of them divisively. Each of these modes produces the opening for the next mode, and together they constitute an event. This event produces an affective tone that gives rise to the consistency of that particular movement-experience. This affective tone is the concern—in Whiteheadian terms—for the event itself. Leader and follower are no longer individuals expressing their roles in a movement of steps: they are co-constituted by the very experience they are relationally creating. Concern is not concern for but concern with.
