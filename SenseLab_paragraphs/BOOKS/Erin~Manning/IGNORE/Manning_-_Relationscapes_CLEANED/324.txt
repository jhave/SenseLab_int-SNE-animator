As the co-arising impulse to measure and experience coalesce within Marey’s work, what increasingly emerge are movement machines—machines that do not strictly represent movement but create new modalities of perception. These machines produce more than results. They produce novelty, which sparks thought, which leads to more experimentation. Movement research that may have begun as an exploration of an already-constituted reality becomes a machinic intervention into the not-yet-seen. While Marey-the-positivist continuously strives toward creating more accurate techniques for the measuring of movement, Marey-the-radical-empiricist creates speculative assemblages that induce complex sensations in the name of the perception of perception. The irony: the degree of precision he seeks in the production of quantifiable results contributes to the creation of event-based machines that provoke an active coupling of movement, bodies and milieu.
