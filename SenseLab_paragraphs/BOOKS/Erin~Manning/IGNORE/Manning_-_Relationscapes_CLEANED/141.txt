The elasticity of the almost shifts the associated milieu of the interval toward a field of curvature. The movement curves and the two bodies moving feel the approach as a joining of the forces of movement. The effect opens the dance to an actualization that is not a displacement per se but a virtual intensity becoming actual. We become spiral. Intensive connection. To remain in the elasticity for as long as possible is the goalâ€”but remaining on the edge of virtuality is a challenging task. Sometimes we linger.
