To see is to feel-with movement moving. Vision is not a passive receptive surface—it is a duration expressed. “The retina is an active surface gathering durational variations into the clarity of a line which was never seen as such. In any given instant, the line receptively speaking was a blur. Its clarity emerges through duration as a function of variation” (Massumi 2006). Vision produces the very novelty Marey’s animated images also seek to convey. The experience of the imperceptible is exactly what vision plays with, animating not a stable surface but creating-with the very potential of the not-yet. There is no seeing that is divorced from movement.
