“An intensive experience is an aesthetic fact,” writes Whitehead (1929/1978, 279). Napangardi moves-with the Dreamings, dreaming their movement. She dances the dance of her people, low to the ground, movement barely seen but intensely felt, its magnitude multiply sensed. Inviting the force of movement to take hold of the image, her work propels the Dreaming toward the multiplicity of its univocity. “Once more!” it sings. Here, where the many become one and are increased by one, Napangardi dances.
