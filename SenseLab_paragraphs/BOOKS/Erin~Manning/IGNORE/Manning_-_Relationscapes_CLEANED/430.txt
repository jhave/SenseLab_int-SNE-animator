Affective politics are not moral politics. An emphasis on movement does not promise an emancipatory politics. Affective politics are what we preconsciously make of them. They are of us and with us: we recompose with them. In this way they are much more dangerous and much more powerful than content-driven politics. They are politics for the making. Affect makes bodies even as it is made by bodies. It preempts what a body can do. In this way, Riefenstahl’s work is prescient: hers is a contemporary political vision.83 This is a politics affective in resonance, imagistic in content, polyrhythmic in style, a politics that has long left behind the figure of Kant’s rational modern subject. This is not a politics already territorialized by the sovereign state. It is a micropolitics of the body through which force-lines create biogrammatic tendencies that beg the question of what politics can do. What politics can do in Riefenstahl’s work is a question of affective tone, of expressivity, much more than it is a question of content.
