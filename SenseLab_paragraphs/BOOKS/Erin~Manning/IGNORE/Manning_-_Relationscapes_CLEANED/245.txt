There is a link to be made here between the dancing and the walkingto-the-bus-stop body, even if the same kinds of technique are not emphasized. The shiftiness of ground may be less palpable with respect to a walking body rushing to a bus stop, but it is nonetheless virtually present: you might, for example, experience a “loss of ground” due to a shift in the level of the sidewalk that causes you to lose your balance. The dancer is trained to defy the ground as stable surface, whereas the everyday walker tends to depend on the ground’s stability. But that does not mean that the ground necessarily conforms to the expectations of the walker.
