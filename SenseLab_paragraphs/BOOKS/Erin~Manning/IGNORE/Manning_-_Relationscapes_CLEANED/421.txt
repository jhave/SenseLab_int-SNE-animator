A similar shot a few years later from the second part of Olympia underscores this tension between disciplinary transcendence of physical transcendentalism. This scene focuses on dancers choreographed by Mary Wigman performing movements inspired in part by Dalcrozeâ€™s Eurhythmics. The scene begins with the camera focusing on a few women dancing, their arms waving as their bodies seem to dissolve into one another. The plane of consistency appears through the dancing arms moving in contrapuntal rhythm with the sky. The swaying of their arms gains in consistency as the camera begins to pan out first horizontally and then vertically. The bodies become atmospheric in a way reminiscent of the earlier arms-grass-hoop series, the immanent movement of arms holding pins swaying together not unlike that of the flags in Triumph of the Will. Womendancing-with-pins merges into the swaying of a multiplicity. Like the earlier shot of the moving flag series, this series is constructed on a plane of immanence that moves toward physical transcendence. Its movement moves us beyond the material into the physicality of its virtual tonalities even as it remains material.
