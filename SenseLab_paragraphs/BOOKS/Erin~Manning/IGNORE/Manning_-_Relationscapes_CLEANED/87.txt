“At any given moment you have to be able to say: What is the potential of this configuration of my body?” (Forsythe in Mei 2003, 1). The potential of a movement is its ability to dynamically extend the many from the one. “The novel entity is at once the togetherness of the ‘many’ which it finds, and also it is one among the disjunctive ‘many’ which it leaves; it is a novel entity, disjunctive among the many entities which it synthesizes. The many become one, and are increased by one” (Whitehead 1929/1978, 21). The potential of a configuration is its evanescence: the ways it will have become. This evanescence can be heard in Whitehead’s concept of concrescence, which is the way he combines togetherness and the production of novelty. The potential of a configuration must always be the production of novelty. This production will always be based on a togetherness where the interval will guide and extend/extrude the process. This togetherness is the relationality out of which all consequent (and simultaneous) intervals are produced. Concrescence is, literally, growing together.
