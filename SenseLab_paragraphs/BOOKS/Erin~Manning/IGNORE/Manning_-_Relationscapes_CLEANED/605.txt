Language and thought are often situated at two extremes of a process of enunciation. For Baggs, the sensory experience of worlding does not imply a lack of language: enunciation is simply one aspect of language’s tangible expressivity. Other forms of languages-in-the-making exist. These can be felt in the emergence of concepts for thought in motion articulated throughout In My Language. For Baggs, concepts are connected to feeling—the sensing of a texture is as important as the reading of words. These languages are not “less than” spoken words—they are the more-than of language’s expressibility. Spoken words are the selected extraction from the nexus of experience that converge into appearance.
