To speak about bodies is ﬁrst and foremost to explore the ways in which bodies move. I locate touch as one way of thinking this body-in-movement. This is not to give touch preferential treatment: throughout, touch is to be understood synesthetically, operating along relational vectors always in dia- logue with other senses (of which there are likely many more than ﬁve). To think touch synesthetically is to appreciate all of the ways in which move- ment qualitatively alters the body. As becomes apparent by the end of Poli- tics of Touch, the senses prosthetically alter the dimensions of the body, in- citing the body to move in excess of its-self toward the world. Sensing toward the world implicates the body in a worlding that re-organizes con- ceptions of space and time.
