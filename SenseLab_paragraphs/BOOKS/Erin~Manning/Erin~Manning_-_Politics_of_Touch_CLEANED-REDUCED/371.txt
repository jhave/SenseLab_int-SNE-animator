A politics of touch is an impossible politics. It is a politics of the future anterior (the will-have come), a politics that is impossible because it has no horizon. A politics of touch is a passage rather than a presence. My skin marks this passage, my wrinkles betray time as ﬂeeting, my touch reaches toward the incongruity that is my own alterity, your difference. I cannot be indifferent to that which I cannot even conceive. This is the challenge of a politics of touch. “Now” is the time of a politics of touch, but not a “now” which remains in the present, rather a “now” that dances between tenses, undulating on the inner crevices of the skin of experience, expressing itself through a touch that cannot quite capture the passage of time even while continuing to reach out. Now is a recurrent potentiality: now is to be negotiated, again and again.
