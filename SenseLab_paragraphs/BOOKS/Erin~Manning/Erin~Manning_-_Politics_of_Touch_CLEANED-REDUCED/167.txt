Sensation’s excessiveness is what Fai experiences in these lonely moments of upside-downness. These are moments when he perhaps realizes that Hong Kong will continue to be upside down, depending on the position from which one perceives it. There is no ultimate directionality, no ultimate positionality. There are simply moments, chaotic moments of sensation and choice, moments when we sense our political present through touch, through bodies in motion, through friendship, through writing. These are moments, as Massumi writes, in which “the world concretely appears” (2002a, 98), where we realize that we world our crossing of paths, the imbrication of rhyzomatic sensations, the texturing of writings. Sensation is an event. It creates spaces for experience as well as gaps, holes, emptinesses and losses. “Meaning” is not guaranteed.
