In Rogues, Derrida presents once more his concept of a democracy-to-come, this time in the name of rogue states. He writes: “The democratic is possibly impossible and the political possibly possible” (2005, 46). Quoting Nancy, Derrida suggests that politics has not yet been capable of thinking democracy, nor democracy the political.
It is possible that for this reason it may no longer even be possible, in the future, to think in terms of “democracy,” and it is possible that this also signiﬁes a general displacement of “the political,” a word we have provisionally mobilized here: perhaps a liberation of the political itself. All things considered, what is lacking is a thinking of the freedom that is not established, but that takes itself in the act of its beginning and its recommencement. This remains for us to consider, perhaps beyond our entire political tradition—and yet in some ways the direction of this imperative has already been thought by at least one part of the revolutionary tradition. (Nancy 1994, 78–79)
