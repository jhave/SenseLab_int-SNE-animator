An impossible politics does not disavow time. Rather it invents time through a re-cognition of the passage of “nows.” This is also what touch does. When I reach out toward you “now” and I touch you, I mark one instant. In the sharing of skin—even if touch is not skin to skin I always touch a surface—I leave an imprint. This imprint is ephemeral. To be felt again, it must be repeated in another now, rendering the touch “in time” impossible if time is to be gathered into a narrative of presence. Touch is a trace, always deferred, always leading toward another moment, another imprint, another touch. A politics of touch calls forth a democratic movement toward justice that releases judgment indeﬁnitely. In practice, this means experiencing justice as the opportunity of postponing a ﬁnal decision even while engaging fully in an act of reaching-toward. To engage fully is to admit responseability. A politics of touch recognizes that there will always be time(s) for another judgment, for another justice that itself will call forth the irreducibility of time.
