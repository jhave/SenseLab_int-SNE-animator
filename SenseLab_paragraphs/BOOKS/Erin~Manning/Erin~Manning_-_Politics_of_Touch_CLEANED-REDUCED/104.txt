Happy Together is a ﬁlm about love, friendship, about two bodies seeking sensation, about translation and strangeness, about touching bodies moving toward multiplicity. It is a ﬁlm about gay men, about tango, about the impossibility of staying in one place, at one time. More than anything, it is a ﬁlm that warns us not to accept the myth of the body’s static encampments in time and space. This is a ﬁlm where the bodies move, where they ﬁght and make love, where they dance and suffer, where they encounter one another not in time and space, but across time and space. This is a ﬁlm about the multiplicity not only of origins, but of beginnings and endings, the multiplicity of identity, of displacement, of encounter. This multiplicity—what I will later call a certain politics of friendship—enables a re-reading through Happy Together of the manner in which bodies challenge the very idea of movement, of touch, of sensation.
