Deleuze and Guattari’s Body without Organs is not a metaphorical concept. The BwO is “of” and “and” the body. The BwO is a way of asking ourselves how we could ever have thought of the body as a unit, as a uniform singularity. The body is never its-self. We have several bodies, none of them “selves” in terms of subjectivity. Touch as reaching toward already alerts us to the downfall of discourses of subjectivity: if my body is created through my movement toward you, there is no “self ” to refer back to, only a proliferation of vectors of intensity that emerge through contact. This contact is not an end-point; it is not a moment of arrival where something like two bodies “meeting” happens. It is far beyond tact. Rather, it is a signaling of a reaching that arrives, momentarily, only to have to have been arrived at, relationally, again.
