The skin challenges this version of biopower, reinscribing within biopower the idea that a body cannot be controlled as such because a body never preexists measures of control. The procedure that renders a body docile—that sustains the national body-politic—must either be reinvented each time the skin ﬁssures, or the skin must become airtight. Skin provides a vocabulary for the political body whose prerequisite need not be actualization. Skin as a biological and political construct reminds us that biopolitics are as virtual as they are ﬂeshy. Biopolitics speak of a body incorporeal, where power is already affecting the body before it has become a body, and the body is already affecting politics before politics has been deﬁned as such. Yet, skin is both corporeal and incorporeal. The body of skin is an extension, always, of the body as it is not yet. Skin reminds us that the body moves all the time, composing and decomposing itself, sensing all the while. Senses play on and beyond our surfaces — our skins — enabling not only new ways of coming to experience, but different ways of thinking the relation between making sense and sensing, between knowing and sensing, between expression and content, between surface and depth.
