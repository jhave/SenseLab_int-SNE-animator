Bodies operate in the crease where past and future coexist. Bodies are in movement and to move they must fold-in, fold-out. “The moments of time are dimensions of each other’s unity of movement into and out of each other. They are co-operating dimensions of transition” (Massumi 2002a, 200). Deleuze’s vocabulary of the virtual is essential here. Bodies—especially the bodies constrained to the discourse of the national body-politic — have been sequestered in a discourse of the actual. Bodies cannot be strictly actual because they are never strictly actual to their movements. They are virtual in the sense that  they  are  always  reaching  toward.  The  abstraction  of the body is the reconceptualization of the difference between actuality and virtuality. “Incorporeal: abstract” (Massumi 2002a, 204).
Bodies are technologies of movement, of transposition. Bodies do not take us home.
