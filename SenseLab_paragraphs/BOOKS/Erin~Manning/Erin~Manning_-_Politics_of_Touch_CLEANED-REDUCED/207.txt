This negotiation of space is a political event. Its politics are in contradiction with a linear and bounded conception of space-time proposed by state sovereignty. A politics of touch does not adhere to the notion of a strict interiority and exteriority. Rather, it expands the chronotope of the body through a qualitative expansion of exfoliations and surfaces. The decoding process is no longer one made in a vertical relationship between the sovereign and the citizen, or the national and the refugee. There is no decoding process as such. There are experiences, events, that operate in and through the spacings of the body: a listening, a seeing, a tasting, a smelling of the senses of the body through touch, a providential integration of one surface into another only to realize that these singularities cannot be meshed but must instead stand alone, side by side, in the third space they create together. What emerges through touch is not a decoding but a qualitative translation of time and space as regards the body, a transformation of space into spacedtime, timed-space.
