I project my body. My projected body is a BwO that envelops a relation of movement and rest. My body is the relation of the relation. Sensing, I embody that engendering relation, I charge that relation with an embodied-event. Touch is eventful. Now to ratify: touch is not knowledge. Touch is expression. A politics of touch is not about knowledge but about the projection of experience that results in expression. It doesn’t end there. Expression is not a result. Expression engenders the desire to reach again. Expression calls forth the concept. The concept calls for a redeﬁnition: politics of touch will never be One.
