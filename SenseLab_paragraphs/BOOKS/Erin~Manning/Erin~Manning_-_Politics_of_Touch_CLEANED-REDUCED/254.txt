Touch is not a conﬁrmation, not an accomplishment, Jesus seems to say. Touch is reaching toward ﬂesh, but not as proof of presence. Touch is the promise that you can reach again and ﬁnd me on the threshold of your senses. “The exposed ﬂesh does not reveal a secret self that had been hidden, but rather dissolves any self that could be apprehended. We not only have nothing left to hide, we no longer present any separate thing for the eyes to grasp. We become imperceptible” (Hardt 2002, 80).
