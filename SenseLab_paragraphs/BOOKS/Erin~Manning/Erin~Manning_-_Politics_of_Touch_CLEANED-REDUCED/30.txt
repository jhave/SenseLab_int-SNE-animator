Bodies without Organs (BwO) take central stage in chapter 6, where the consequences of exploring sensing bodies in movement become palpable: If bodies emerge in the act of reaching-toward, creating space-time through a “worlding” that can be violent, can we still conceive of the body as “organic”? Artaud’s concept of the Body without Organs evokes the strangeness of a body-becoming that is always, in some sense, unreachable, both biologically and conceptually. Politics of Touch will not have been about a body we already know. Chapter 6 asks: If the body can no longer be deﬁned as such, is it possible to secure this body? If the body is always in excess its-self, what “body” is there for the state to secure? These questions mirror the concerns of chapter 1’s dance between national identity and transcultural negotiations of difference: is there a body of the nation-state?
