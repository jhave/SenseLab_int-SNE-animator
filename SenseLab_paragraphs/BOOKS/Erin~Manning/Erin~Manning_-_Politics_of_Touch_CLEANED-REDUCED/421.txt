To think democracy through touch is to begin to reconsider the role of sense, the senses, and making sense. If democracy is no longer to be assigned a secure space within the grids of intelligibility of statecraft, we are left with a more productive idea of the political that speaks of aporias, of sensation, of movement, a notion of the political that is difﬁcult to grasp. What is easier to grasp is the idea of “making sense.” This is because making sense calls forth a politics of common sense that would seem, at the surface at least, to work within the grammars we already understand and thereby to negate incommensurability, lack of measure, uncountability. But when we take a step further and recognize that, at least for Aristotle, common sense referred to touch, we are struck by the realization that sense is never made consistently—how could it be, when sense senses?
