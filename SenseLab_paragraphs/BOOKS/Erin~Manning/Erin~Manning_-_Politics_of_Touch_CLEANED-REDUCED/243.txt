Touch errs. Being in relation is about the experience of erring, which is at the heart of any desire to reach toward. It would be fallacious to argue that the body is always constant in its directionality. A politics of touch must be errant.10 Social consensus is precarious precisely because it rests on an injunction not to err.11 Consensus, as the mechanism for a prescribed democracy ordained within the state system, is the ultimate form of unidirectionality. It embodies a different violence than that of erring toward an other. State violence takes count only of the goal, and not of the process. Consensus ignores the fragility of an erring movement: it pretends that its displacements are always known in advance. The violence of consensus is most hazardous, since it believes it cannot err.
