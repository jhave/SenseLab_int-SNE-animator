For Butler, the sexing of bodies is a process that takes place through the (political) regulations of norms established in and through language. These norms regulate how bodies are represented, where our bodies ﬁt into the spectrum of diversity and differentiation, and, I would add, how our bodies are touched and touching. Since touch always implies a reaching toward an other who must always remain untouchable, touch can be considered as largely non-normative, at least in the ﬁrst instance. Touch manifests itself as material in an incomplete process of materialization. Materialization cannot be “completed” through touch since touch necessitates a return that will always in some sense destabilize its initial commitment toward an other. Given the fact that, as Butler writes, “bodies never quite comply with the norms by which their materialization is compelled” (1993, 2), touch could be said to operate as one of the many potential resistances to the normative process at the heart of materialization, bringing to the fore the complexities within the form-matter matrix on which the differentiation of bodies depends.
