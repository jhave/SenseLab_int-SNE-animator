A Being without violence would be a Being which would occur outside the existent: nothing; nonhistory; nonoccurence; nonphenomenality. A speech produced without the least violence would determine nothing, would say nothing, would offer nothing to an other; it would not be history, and it would show nothing; in every sense of the word, and ﬁrst of all the Greek sense, it would be speech without a phrase. (1978, 146–47)
