Politics of touch are about potential energy. The actualization of potential energy alters states, causing shifts from individuation to individuation through the metastability of transduction. In other words, engenderings alter the relation between time, space, and bodies as bodies time space and space time. What a body can do is in-formed and de-formed by this potential energy at both the level of the individualizing individual and at the level of state politics. Energy can actualize in myriad forms. In the case of gender politics, what too often happens is that energy is located only at the level of the individual body. In Bodies That Matter, Butler suggests that it must be possible to use the terms “matter,” “gender,” and “sex,” while at the same time subjecting the terms to a critique that interrogates the exclusionary operations and differential power-relations that construct and delimit feminist invocations of “woman.” Without this critique, she argues, feminism loses its democratizing potential through a refusal to engage and become transformed by the exclusions that put it into play. What is of particular concern to her, in a renegotiation of gendered bodies, is the normative aspect of all genderings, and the conjunction between this acceptance of a gendered norm and the discourse of politics: sex not only functions as a norm, but is part of a regulatory practice that produces the bodies it governs... whose regulatory force is made clear as a kind of productive power, the power to produce—demarcate, circulate, differentiate—the bodies it controls.
