Concepts only go so far before they must be reinvented. The notion of posthumanity is in many ways heavy-handed. But what is evocative about it (and its coupling with the delightfully heavy-handed BwO) are its connotations of incompleteness, its prosthetic indeterminacies, its insecurities of embodiment. The post in the human suggests not that we come afterwards as prosthetic newcomers, but that we were always already embodied in excess of our organs.15 My goal here is not to trace the history or the contemporaneity of the posthuman. Rather, I present the concept to offer one more entry point into how bodies are not only continually constructed through the senses, but are also relationally inter-created in a ﬁeld of prosthetic in(ter)vention. At the same time, I want to draw attention to the fact that technologically, there is nothing “new” to the posthuman. What is new, perhaps, is to think the senses as prosthetic. Posthumanity, as Hayles points out, is not a concept of the future, but a concept of the past that has been strangely overlaid with a conception of human bodies as humanistically static. We have always been posthuman.
