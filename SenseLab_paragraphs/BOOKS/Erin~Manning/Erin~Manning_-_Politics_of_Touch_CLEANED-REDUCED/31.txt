The BwO stands in for the becoming-body, the body that will-have-come. Bodies without Organs do not suggest that you have to divest your-self of your biology. To create a BwO means that you move toward the world in excess of your organsâ€™ organization. Politics of touch are politics concerned with bodies that are always qualitatively more-than their internal organizations. Bodies are not discrete entities facing one another in neutral space-time. Politics of touch imply reachings toward the world that create timed spaces and spaced times that themselves create bodies in relation. Bodies interrelate, extending form into matter and matter into form. BwO not only create relational networks with the world and with each other, these relations themselves become embodied. Bodies incorporate by becoming more than them-selves.
