Inﬂuenced by the tactile bodies etched by Michelangelo, Blake celebrates ﬂesh and sensing bodies in movement in his writings and etchings. For Blake, the ideal human form is not to be found in the “Garden of Love.” The ideal form is not a disembodied spirit, not an eternal soul. The ideal human is a carnal, ﬂeshy, sensing body in movement. This body is not ﬁxed as a determinable or measurable form, as a unitary or self-contained individuality. This body is indeﬁnite, ever-changing, relational. In many ways, it is a Deleuzian or Spinozean body, where life is understood not simply as form, but as a complex relation between differential velocities, between deceleration and acceleration of particles. In this relational body, the senses are deﬁned as “windows” (Europe 3:1,5) rather than surfaces, as openings that liberate the vast realms of experience. The window in Blake is not a transparent surface through which one gazes. It is an opening which exposes the world in all of its inconsistencies. Through the window, bodies move and senses are unleashed.
