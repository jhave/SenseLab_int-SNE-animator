Recombinations involve transductions. In genetics, transductions refer to the transfer by a bacteriophage of genetic material from one bacterium to another. Simondon uses transduction to convey the idea of reaching-toward or leading across toward dynamic form. Transductions suggest a de-phasing in the system through which new individuations emerge. Individuations are multilayered processes of engendering whereby the activity of becoming extends in multiple directions beyond unity and identity. Transduction can be conceptualized as the relation between individuations through which composite bodies are engendered. Transduction does not happen to the body. Transduction is of the body, operational constitutively within its systems of in-formation. Transduction may quantitatively alter matter and form, but it is more likely that it will not, instead activating matter and form toward qualitative individuations. Bodies will become other not in their carapaces but in their potentialities. “[T]o think the transductive operation that is the foundation for the various levels of individuation, the notion of form is insufﬁcient” (Simondon 1995, 33). Transductively, form becomes in-formation. This supposes the existence of a system in a metastable state that is open to individuation. Ontogenesis, not ontology.
