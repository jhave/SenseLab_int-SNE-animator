as relational rather than as individual, the violence morphs and with it the imaginary of power-as-hierarchy that inhabits state bodies. Sensing bodies in movement produce power, violently, perhaps, but relationally, always. I cannot affect you violently: I affect us. To touch is to violently or gently encounter a surface, a contour. To touch is to feel the perceived limits of my contours, my surfaces, my body in relation to yours. To touch is to expand these contours, creating new perimeters. We share our surface in the moment of touch, we interrupt our-selves.
