Since the nineteenth century, few political theorists have concerned themselves with an exploration of the sensing mechanisms that drive the body and force it out of the grids of intelligibity that would like to capture it for service to the national body-politic and its measures of qualiﬁcation. A link could be drawn between the normalization of state sovereignty and its adjacent body-politic, and the denial of the sensing body in movement. Without a commitment to the ways in which bodies move, bodies become stabilized within national imaginaries in preordained categories, such as citi- zen, refugee, man, woman, homed, homeless. Deliberately avoiding the entanglements inherent in articulating (and ordering) sensing bodies in movement, the state can claim that its body-politic is uniﬁed. The body can be described and its politics can be deﬁned. Within state discourse, com- mon sense is at stake, not the senses. To reclaim the sensing body in move- ment is therefore to think both alongside and against the nation-state.
