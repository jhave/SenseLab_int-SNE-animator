It is in this sense that bodies are machinic. Bodies cannot be measured solely by adding their parts (their organs), thus creating an ambulatory whole. Bodies engage symbiotically, incorporeally, virtually, always becoming more- than they already seem to be. They are as real as they are abstract, as virtual as they are actual. In the words of Deleuze and Guattari, they are abstract machines: they lack determinate form or actual content deﬁnition in any ﬁnal way. BwO are central to a politics of touch because they reinforce the injunction to invent, operating always in the space-time of the “will have been,” a future anterior that discloses the fact that we can never completely latch onto them. Bodies—all bodies—escape our grasp. They are not graspable partly because they exceed our expectations of them. Bodies are never quite there. They are not quite there because movement is characterized by its engagement with space-times that have not yet been charted, analphabetic space-times as yet undisclosed, undiscovered. Bodies are strange machines, machines because they produce extensions of themselves, because they generate systems both in and far from equilibrium, systems that resist strict organization.
