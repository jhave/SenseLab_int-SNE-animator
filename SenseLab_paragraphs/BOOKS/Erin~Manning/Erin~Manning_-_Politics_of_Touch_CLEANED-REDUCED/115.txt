Happy Together is not a democratic ﬁlm, if we understand democracy as a fraternization between those of similar strands of identity. There is no ultimate commonality, either in the representation of Buenos Aires, nor in that of Hong Kong. In both places, the decentering of commonality takes precedence, whether in the image of Asian boys playing European football in the streets of Buenos Aires or in the upside-down images of Hong Kong. The world has fallen on its head, and with it a politics of fraternization we have come to understand as “the democratic.” What is at stake here is something different, an operation that seeks not to recognize the “friendship/democracy” (the fraternity) at hand, but the creation, the production of the possibility of friendship under another name. This politics of friendship is an act rather than a state, it is a movement toward multiplicity that loves before being loved. As Derrida writes, “One must start with the friend-who-loved, not with the friend-who-is-loved, if one is to think friendship” (1997, 9).
