Is the asignifying body thinkable? Perhaps it is uncountable, incoherent, but not unthinkable. A new vocabulary of the surface seems necessary, however, to address the strange incorporation of bodies into skins and skins into bodies. To begin with, we must renegotiate the binaries within the language that frames the body: skin, bones, ﬂesh, inside, outside, mind, matter, reason, sense. Skin and bones may not be as dichotomous as we believe they are. When bones are conceived as layers of skin, the body thins (we have a tendency to think the body’s weightiness from the inside out, focusing ﬁrst on the bones, that is, the structure that holds it together). As Taylor remarks, at the point where bones and skin are no longer juxtaposed, “the body is deprived of its substance and appears to be on the verge of disappearing” (1997, 139).
