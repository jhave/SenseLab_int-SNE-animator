This does not mean that it is violent in and of itself. What it means is that the risk of reaching out to touch you is an engagement in an ethicopolitical decision. This process of decision-“taking”2 is always in negotiation with an economy of violence because it implies an articulation that is a rendering-other of myself. As Derrida writes, “Each little gesture of an other towards me obligates me to respond by sacriﬁcing an other of an other, his or her. . . other gesture” (1995, 68). This response-ability toward an other is a demand of an other to return the gesture, for there is no such thing as touch without consequence. Touch induces a repetition, a response that is unique, since it is a reaching toward the unknowable. Touch is a reaching out toward the discursive silences and noises of the body, to the temptations of life on earth.
