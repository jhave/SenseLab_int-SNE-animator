Individuation is a process that takes place in the moment, a juncture that is strictly speaking neither past, present, nor future. To work with the process of individuation through which democracy emerges, we must there- fore resist nostalgic narratives that attempt to hold time in place, presenting us with pseudocomforting images of an all-encompassing touch. Such narratives sound like this: “In the past, there was real contact. Now we barely speak any more, all of us obsessed with our new technologies, cell phones attached to our ears, hands shackled to our keyboards, eyes focused on our screens.” There is no such touch of a pre-lived past for us to miss: to feel touched we must continuously replenish the touching. Touch will only have occurred again: touch touches toward the future. There is no sensation of touch  that  remains  alert  without  reinstantiation.  Touch  is  a  change of pace. Touch keeps us moving, inciting us to sense beyond this moment toward another moment. Touch is very much in-time with the troubling and exciting rifts caused by the accelerations of timed-spaces in the contemporaneity of which Connolly speaks.
