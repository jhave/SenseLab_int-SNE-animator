We should therefore, without playing, ever, on the words, listen (entendre) and tender (tendre) tenderly these words. Tender and tender.... To tender is to offer, or give, what can be given without rendering, that is to say without exchange, or without waiting for an other to render—or to arrive (sans attendre que l’autre vienne rendre—ou se rendre). (Derrida 2000, 111)
