We are tempted to believe in a standard, “normal” two-gender sexuality, but over the long haul, genders change. Imperfections, developmental abnormalities, kinks, sports, “monstrous” new forms of behaviour, including reproductive behaviour, arise and persist as sexual organisms undergo social trans-formation.
