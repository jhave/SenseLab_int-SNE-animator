“Now as throughout Earth’s history, living associations form and dissolve. Symbioses, both stable and ephemeral, prevail” (Margulis 1998, 12). Symbioses call forth surprising engenderings. These engenderings mark all kinds of transformations. They permit the ontogenesis of the rigidity of gender identities through the construction and reconstruction of forms and functions of reproduction. Positing engendering as my point of departure, what I seek to explore is how human sex practices (and adjacent politics of gender identity) are embedded in our historical and cultural roots8 as mementos to practices of segregation, imposed difference, essential traits. Mind-body dualisms ﬁgure prominently in the naturalization of discourses of gender identity, most often re-entrapping the body in pre-established conﬁgurations overdetermined by linguistic, political, and evolutionary signiﬁcation. “The continuous displacement of the signiﬁer ‘sex’ does not succeed in detaching feminine desire from ﬁxed nature as it fails to challenge the fundamental problematic of the body, biological identity, the imperative of sexual procreation and ultimately the metaphysical conception of matter (ﬁxed, stable nature, where matter is inert)” (Parisi 2004, 10). The concept of engendering invites us to think the project of gendering bodies differently, emphasizing the manner in which bodies individuate, evolving into forms that highlight the nonlinear dynamics and unpredictable potential of matter’s trans-formations.
