The tango opens the way for an engagement with a cultural phenome- non that is at once ﬁercely nationalistic and startlingly inventive. To think tango both as a transcultural improvisation and as a national artifact is vital to the project of Politics of Touch because it reminds us that there is no clean slate onto which bodies are written and politics are made. Even while they potentially resist the boundaries of the state, transcultural phenomena often remain embedded  within national  imaginaries. Politics—like  bodies— emerge out of frictions, accidents, disagreements, and interlockings that are both ﬁrmly institutionalized within pre-constituted space-times and that create emergent space-times. We must remember, however, that whether sanctioned by the nation or positioned transculturally in excess of the national body-politic, there is no body that exists before it moves. This means that bodies must always be stilled to be characterized. It is a back- gridding process. When stilled, politics—and bodies—can be stabilized in the name of a larger system (state sovereignty, the nation-state, the body- politic). But even then, these “stable” compositions must be ferociously maintained and contained, lest they begin to reach toward one another, engaging in compositions that remind us that bodies are always stranger (unheimlich) than they ﬁrst appear.
