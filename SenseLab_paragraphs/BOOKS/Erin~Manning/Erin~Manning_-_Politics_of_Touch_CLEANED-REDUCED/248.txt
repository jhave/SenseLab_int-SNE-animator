The parting words of Benjamin’s Critique of Violence lead us back to God’s Word: “Divine Violence, which is the sign and seal but never the means of sacred execution, may be called sovereign violence” (1978, 300). God has spoken: to touch is to be violently expelled from the garden. The violence of the Fall, the violence of sovereignty, is transposed into the word. John writes: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God” (John 1:1).
