For Derrida, democracy is still to come: “We do not yet know what democracy will have meant, or what democracy is. For democracy does not present itself, it has not yet presented itself, but that will come” (2005, 9). The issue is not how to place a politics of touch within an already-existing discourse of democracy, but how to think touch in such a way as to allow us to re-negotiate a politics of time and space that would not be anathema to a democratic politics. This is not a small task, as William Connolly underlines, for narratives of democracy (as an already-existing phenomenon) are themselves changing: in a world replete with asymmetries of pace and an acceleration of speed that often supports corporate colonization of new spaces inside and outside highly organized capitalist states, “the ensuing politics of capture often foments reactive movements in the name of nationhood and religious purity, expressed as attempts to slow the world down by returning to a unity imagined to have been intact sometime in the past” (2002, 143). Politics is speeding up, and with it, the concept of democracy is changing: “The question for me, then, is not how to slow the world down, but how to work with and against a world moving faster than heretofore to promote a positive ethos of pluralism” (Connolly 2002, 143).
