Violence is potentially productive as well as destructive. To touch is always to attempt to touch the incorporeality of a body, to touch what is not yet. I do not touch the you that I think you are, I reach toward the one you will become. There is always singular becoming, but singular in the sense of a collective event, not in the sense of a coded number within a series.
