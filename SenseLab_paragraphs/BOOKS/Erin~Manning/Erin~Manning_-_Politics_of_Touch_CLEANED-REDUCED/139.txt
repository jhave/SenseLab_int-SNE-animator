Po-Wing’s inﬁrmity leads to his imprisonment within Fai’s domain. We watch as Fai prepares Po-Wing’s bed, Po-Wing’s head captured on the screen from behind the bed’s cast-iron bars. Fai washes him. “Did you get to see the falls?” Po-Wing asks Fai. “No. Did you?” “I was waiting to go with you,” Po-Wing responds. “We’ll go when I’m better.” “We’ll see,” answers Fai. This exchange signals a change occurring within Lai-Yu Fai, who is not yet able to give up Po-Wing, but already understands that the nostalgic dream of the falls is an impossibility in the world they have created. Ultimately, the hierarchical caretaking will lead them to the same place of nostalgic impossibility as the dream of the falls, but for the moment Fai only seems to understand the one impossibility and not the other. Both caretaking and touristic image-seeking are pursuits based in a discourse of the state, but for now only the more obvious of the two is apparent to Lai-Yu Fai.
