“Sensation,” writes Massumi, “the substance of the body, is not the presence of the ﬂesh in its envelope, but the presence in the ﬂesh of an outside force of futurity” (2002a, 115). My body opens toward yours. Even without contact, there is no closure of the body, just a holding-in, a slowing down of the movement. In movement, I sense you, I alter the space that I cross between us, that you cross to reach me, I allow you to touch me, to make con-tact. “The body is opening itself to qualitative change, a modiﬁcation of its very deﬁnition, by reopening its relation to things” (Massumi 2002a, 116). Sensation is the potential to invent, to invent the in-betweenness out of which my body, your body, moves, senses, and multiplies. Sensation reconnects the body, not to its-self, but to relation. Desire is one of the main ingredients of this re-cognition. I sense to desire, even if I do not necessarily desire to sense. I touch contact. Movement is not indexed to position, our positionality is our movement, our politics is our friendship, our touch is our politics.
