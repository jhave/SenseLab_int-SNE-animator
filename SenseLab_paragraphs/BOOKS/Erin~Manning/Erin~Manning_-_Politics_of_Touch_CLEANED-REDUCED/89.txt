If there is no world without you, it is because reaching toward you initiates the creation of both my becoming-body and my becoming-world. My becoming-world occurs at the intersection of our touch. The political gesture that is our touch occurs in the entre-deux which makes inter-relation with you both possible and insurmountable. Faced with each other, we experience a being-with that must remain, always, a being-without, a simultane-ous moment of feeling the direction of your body, and knowing that this touch, though directed at me, will serve to mark the separation, the schism between us. This is politics: the moment when I re-cognize that to touch an other is to touch the impenetrable.
