An incommensurability of politics signals the necessity to reassess, continuously, where politics takes place. This can only be successful if we become aware of the manner in which we space and time, actively, virtually. A concept of liberty cannot be other than a concept involving moving bodies. A free body is not a secured body. Liberty, politics, bodies have no preestablished form. But they can form, their shapes mutating in the process, individuating, expanding, intensifying. “Freedom: to measure oneself against nothing” (Nancy 1994, 71).
