Faced with this “perhaps,” Po-Wing and Lai-Yu Fai eventually go their separate ways. Before their ﬁnal leave-taking, we observe Fai on the phone in endless conversations with Po-Wing who we assume is waiting for him at home or in bars. We watch as Fai slowly pulls away from Po-Wing, looking at maps of Iguazu with a solo journey to the falls in mind, a journey he still thinks will eventually lead him “home.” Home still ﬁgures in Lai-Yu Fai’s vocabulary, even if it has become somewhat unmoored by his recent experiences in Buenos Aires. This desire for “home” is also present in Po-Wing’s narrative, though we have no sense of home being somewhere in particular for him. He does want his passport back, but we do not know if it is for a return to Hong Kong or merely for the illusion that he once “belonged” somewhere. A relationship that has been framed by a tacky lamp is coming to an end.
Friendship is never far from enmity, according to Carl Schmitt. For Schmitt, the enemy is the ﬁgure at the heart of the political: losing the enemy would imply a loss of the political itself. In order to conjure the political, the enemy must be invented: “The speciﬁc political distinction, to which political actions and notions can be reduced, is the distinction between friend and enemy” (Schmitt 1996, 26).
