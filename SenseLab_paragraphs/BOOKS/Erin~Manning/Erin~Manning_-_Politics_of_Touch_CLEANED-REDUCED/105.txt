When the body is ﬁgured simply as discursive, it is held in a place where it can signify but not sense: sense is not something than can easily be captured linguistically. As Brian Massumi writes, “Sensation is utterly redundant to [signifying gestures’] description. Or worse, it is destructive to it, because it appeals to an unmediated experience” (2002a, 2). Too often, when we speak of sensation, we stop the movement of the body. This happens because we have delineated the body as a signifying subject in language. In and of itself, this is not a problem. The issue is, however, that when we position the body to signify only discursively, we often stop its movement, placing it on a grid from whence we render it intelligible. But sensation cannot be stopped, and this is the reason it is difﬁcult to render sensation within a linguistic signifying system. To sense, we must cut through time and space, moving, challenging both semantic and geographical boundaries. Sensation is not a coding of bodies. When we sense we are not pro- ducing a map that will lead us back to an “origin.”
