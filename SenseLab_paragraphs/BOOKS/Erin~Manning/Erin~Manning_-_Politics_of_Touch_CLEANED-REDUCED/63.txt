A potential naming occurs not only in the spoken enunciation, but also in the textual moment of decision-taking, in the resounding silence of tango, during that moment that incites me to reach out to touch an other, not only with my words, but with my senses. Potentiality is at the heart of this reaching-toward. As Agamben writes: “If the ‘thing itself’ in language exists in the mode of potentiality, then it follows that language must originally have the form not of actual signiﬁcation but of the mere capacity to signify” (1999, 18).
