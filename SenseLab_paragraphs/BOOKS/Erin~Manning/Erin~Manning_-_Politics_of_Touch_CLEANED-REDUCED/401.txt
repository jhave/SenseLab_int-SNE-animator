For Connolly, a certain asymmetry of pace is critical to democratic pluralism. Yet, asymmetries of pace also foster the fragility of democracy. It is this fragility that is of particular interest here as regards the intersection between politics, touch, and democracy. The movement invoked by a reaching-toward must always be uncertain: when I reach toward you, I do not know what I will touch â€” I do not yet know how your touch will return to me. I know only that I am willing to take the risk inherent in the movement of reaching-toward. This uncertainty is predicated on the double-take of touch. If I pretend to know the outcome of my reaching-toward, I am not really reaching-toward. In other words, when space is preconstructed (when the space between is overdetermined by my certainty about you and your simple location11 in the world), there is no space to cross, there is no chronotope to create, and ultimately, there is no potential for touch as a reachingtoward. Touch becomes political the instant I reach out toward you in an uncertain movement of unknowing, of unknowability. Touch, when I reach you, does not then transfer into a knowable commodity, but into another possibility of reaching out: I touch you to touch you again. To touch is not to know.
