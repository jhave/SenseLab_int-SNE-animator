If the body cannot be reduced to a language, how can we speak of the body? How can we articulate touch as a mechanism in and of the body? How can we locate the importance of the concept of touch for the political? And, ultimately, how can we disentangle the body from the straitjacket of the nationally and state-sanctioned body-politic? Perhaps we can begin by suggesting that space is “modeled” by the body itself (Gil 1998, 17). If space is no longer something the body “inhabits,” where space is conceived of as a premade container for the body, we can begin to think of the body as a mechanism for reaching out across and instantiating time and space. As Gil writes, bodily movements impress in space the traces of essential corporeal form,  and create conﬁgurations there (in the relation between things) for which the matrices and lineaments are made up from the morphogenetic forms and possibilities of the body.
