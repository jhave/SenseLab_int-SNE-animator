In fact, between 1962 and 1965, tango was the most popular musical genre in Finland, and this not for a reproduction of a tango born in Argentina, but for the dissemination of a tango native to the aspirations and disappointments of a very particularly Finnish population. Finnish tangos, like their Argentine counterparts, are passionate, but the Finnish passion is not as polyvalent as its predecessor. Finnish tangos are slow and the dance is measured, described by some as a rigid interpretation and exposition of emotions and social protestation.
