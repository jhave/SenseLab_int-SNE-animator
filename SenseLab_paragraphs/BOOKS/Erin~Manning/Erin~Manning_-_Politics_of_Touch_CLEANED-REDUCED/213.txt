Touch, as an ethico-political moment, breaks with the false alternative between ends and means that paralyzes both the ethical and the political within the matrix of regimes of state-imposed territoriality. The mediality of touch is nothing more than a process made visible, a process geared toward the creation and dissemination of my body through the reciprocity of your body, not as an entity as such but as a potentiality. Because touch makes the means of reaching out visible, it can be envisioned as a counterpart to a political moment of encounter, a moment in which there is an emergence of the being-in-mediality of humanity. This moment is ethical not because of the intentions of the one who reaches toward, but because the reaching does not assume anything beyond the intermediacy of a response, that is, beyond the creation of a third space. Even if I pull back and do not quite reach you, I have already altered the space that modulates our bodies-in-relation. The gesture that is touch, whether it reaches you or not, becomes the communication of a communicability. This gesture does not speak in sentences, it speaks the body, reminding us that our skins are always in movement through time and space, shedding themselves, shedding our-selves.
