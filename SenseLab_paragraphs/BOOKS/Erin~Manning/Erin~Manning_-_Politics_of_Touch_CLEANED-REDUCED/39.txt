Central to Politics of Touch is the notion that to touch is not simply to put organs in contact with the world. Touch foregrounds the senses as machinic assemblages. I would like to think of the senses as prosthetic devices, always more and less than single and singular bodies. To think the senses prosthetically, I turn to the concept of originary technicity. Originary technicity suggests that a natural, originary body does not exist. Technology is not something that is simply added to the body from outside. Technology is a supplement, an aspect of the body that adds to it while it qualitatively alters that very body. “The dynamic of technicity will thus be the dynamic of the prosthetic—and thereby the human as non-proper supplementarity—in general” (Bennington 1996, 181). Originary technicity draws out the human, exposing humanity to its prosthetic attachments. Senses can be thought as prosthetic exfoliations of the body’s technicity.
