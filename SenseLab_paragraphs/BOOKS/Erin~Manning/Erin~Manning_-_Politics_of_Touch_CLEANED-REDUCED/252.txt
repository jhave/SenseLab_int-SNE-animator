the difference as the untouchability that will forever draw me outside my “self.” Untouchable, I realize that I have no self, that I exist in relation, that I am in relation to my own untouchability. My body is not One.
Over and over in the Bible, Jesus is touched and his touch heals. This touch is a laying of hands,14 an ingestion of an other not unlike the swallowing of his body in the form of the host. Only once does Jesus ask not to be touched: when he returns to his grace and Mary reaches toward him. This moment of touch/untouchability takes place when Mary is faced with a different (incarnated) body. Jesus’ resurrection alters the status of touch. He seems to say: “Do not touch me, do not restrain me, do not think you can catch me or reach me, for I am leaving for the Father, that is to say, again and always toward death’s power, and I am leaving from death to death, I am melting into my nocturnal lustre on this spring morning” (Nancy 2003, 31). Reach out but do not touch. Believe in the untouchability that always precedes and exceeds our relation. Have faith.
