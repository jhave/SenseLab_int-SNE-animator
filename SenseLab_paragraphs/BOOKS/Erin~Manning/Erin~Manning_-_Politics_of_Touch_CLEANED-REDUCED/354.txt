When we consider the engendering body, we can see its operation as that which not only individuates in potentially antagonistic ways, but also as that which creates antagonism within the national body-politic. In the moment of touching an other (within or across time and space), my body re-engenders itself, causing a potential ﬁssure in the national body-politic. My engendering body is difference incorporated symbiotically, difference not sexed through stratiﬁed evolutionary narratives, but difference embodied through engenderings toward politics that reach toward differing understandings of what a body can do. “One does not represent, one engenders and traverses” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 364).
