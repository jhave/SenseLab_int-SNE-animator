From Helsinki to Tokyo to Barcelona to Portland to Rome to Istanbul, tango continues to be danced, altered, exchanged and sent back, changed, to Buenos Aires. Tango expresses itself differently from one environment to another, from one couple to another: most often a heterosexual encounter in Argentina, tango in Holland increasingly blurs gender and sexual boundaries by challenging and altering the roles of the leaders and the followers. Hence, however adamantly ideologically withheld by those who seek to possess it, tango can be thought of as a music and a dance that lives through ï¬‚exibility, mutation, evocation, pluralization, and transculturation.
