A politics of touch engages a milieu that is continually under construction. This milieu is incorporeal in the sense that it does not exist except in the relation that will emerge through individuations that have not yet materialized. This milieu is as much a transitory location as a spring board for individuations to occur not at the level of the individual body, but in relation. This milieu is an energetic force ﬁeld that constitutes form and matter beyond notions of internal and external pre-conﬁgurations. Symbiosis of matter and form emerge relationally. This calls forth engenderings. The engendering body is a body not only in relation but of relation. Relation is activity, intensity, movement toward. Engendering is an event through which emergent bodies take form.
