Sensory and motor tonus of the skin are uninterruptedly stimulated by the environment: nerve ﬁbers conducting tactile impulses are generally of larger size than those associated with other organs. Coetaneous stimulation is essential for the adequate organic and behavioral development of the organism. Newborn animals must be licked if they are to survive (otherwise they are at risk of dying of a functional failure of the genitourinary system and/or the gastrointestinal system). In humans, this licking is replaced by a long period of labor, during which the contractions of the uterus stimulate the fetal skin. Infants who are not adequately touched after birth often suffer tremendously, sometimes even dying as a result (Montagu 1971, 82). Skin performs such essential tasks that it is rarely, if ever, “busy.” The skin remains quiet in order “to increase its capacity to learn, to become habituated to codes that cannot be interfered with under any conditions” (Montagu 1971, 152). The vibrotactile or electrotactile signals of the skin cannot be shut out, nor can the skin close its eyes or ears or hold its breath. Even in sleep, the skin remains the most alert of the organs, and it is the ﬁrst to recover upon awakening.
