An interesting aspect of Michelangelo’s image of Adam and God with ﬁngers almost touching is that it is difﬁcult to tell who is reaching toward whom. In this regard, the fresco symbolizes touch in its most transparent reciprocity. I cannot touch you without you touching me in return. I cannot feel your skin without you feeling me. This, it seems to me, is imprinted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel: Hands are dangerous, for in reaching toward an other, they can undermine  the  hierarchical  opposition  between  self and other, reducing this exchange to a moment of sharing that potentially exceeds the two individuals, the two bodies in motion. These are transactional bodies, bodies engaged in the decision to touch or not to touch an other. Through touch, bodies are created. Is that why, in this particular case, the ﬁngers do not touch? One interpretation would be that God does not decide to reach far enough toward Adam to actually touch him. Yet they are both reaching, meeting almost half-way, which might lead us to believe that there is something more at stake in the moment of unreachability between the Self-Same and the unknowable.
