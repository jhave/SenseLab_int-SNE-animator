To share absolutely is impossible. To share entails a remainder. Democracy as sharing must remain a chance, a possibility in the making. A democracy-to-come is rendered possible only in the constitutive rift of the moment, in the ﬁssure wherein resides the drive to decide between various directionalities, all leading toward the not-yet-known. This leading-toward out of which movement is generated becomes the condition of possibility of democracy, for it renders imaginable a political becoming that dares cross rifts and ﬂows.
