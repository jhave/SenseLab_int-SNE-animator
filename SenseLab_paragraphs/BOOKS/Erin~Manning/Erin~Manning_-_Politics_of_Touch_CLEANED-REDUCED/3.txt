Let me foreground one aspect of Meany’s work as a pertinent example of how research on the senses often continues to reconstitute the preconsti- tuted Cartesian body even while it attempts to expose the body to new sensing conﬁgurations. Meany writes that “fathers cannot be included in the experiment because there are not enough research funds” (2004, A6), thus taking for granted gendered assumptions as regards the senses and the reason-senses, mind-body dualisms. Meany does not know what the father’s role is in regard to the child’s sensing body not only because research funds were not sufﬁcient but because fathers have never been a research priority as regards the senses. Therefore, while Meany’s research exhibits a qualita- tive opening in the reason-senses paradigm, he is ﬁnally incapable of recog- nizing the body outside the normative constraints of the very Cartesianism that has held the senses captive for at least three centuries: the father con- tinues to be associated with reason and the mother with the senses. In addition, the senses remain organized within a motor-sensory system that retains the active-passive dichotomy between the one who touches and the one touched.
