There is no touch in the singular. To touch is always to touch something, someone. I touch not by accident, but with a determination to feel you, to reach you, to be affected by you. Touch implies a transitive verb, it implies that I can, that I will reach toward you and allow the texture of your body to make an imprint on mine. Touch produces an event.
