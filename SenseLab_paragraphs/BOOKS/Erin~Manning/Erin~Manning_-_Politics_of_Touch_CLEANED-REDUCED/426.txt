The problem with divesting signiﬁcation of sense(s) is that it reinforces a return to a process of conditioning whereby we move in a tight circle of condition to conditioned, signifying only to the extent that we already locate within our vocabularies the premises for signiﬁcation as good sense. In order for signiﬁcation to avoid this vicious circle, it must create a residue that avoids the form of the conditioned. This residue can be thought as the aporia, the sheets of time, the trace. The aporia within the discourse of sense betrays the uncanny relation between sensing and making sense. The senses are supplements to signiﬁcation in the Derridean sense not simply of adding to but also replacing: the supplement supplements. It adds only to replace. It intervenes or insin-uates itself in-the-place-of; if it ﬁlls, it is as if one ﬁlls a void. If it represents and makes an image, it is by the anterior default of a presence. Compensatory [suppléant] and vicarious, the supplement is an adjunct, a subaltern instance which takes-(the)-place [tient-lieu]. As substitute, it is not simply added to the positivity of a presence, it produces no relief, its place is assigned in the structure by the mark of an emptiness.... Whether it adds or substitutes itself, the supplement is exterior, outside of the positivity to which it is super-added, alien to that which, in order to be replaced by it, must be other than it. (Derrida 1974, 145)
