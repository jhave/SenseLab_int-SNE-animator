Ethology studies the composition of relations or powers between different things. Ethologies are not about knowledge as end-points but about accumulation and difference. They are about extension, about expressions, about events, about becomings. “[Ethology] is not a matter of utilizations or captures, but of sociabilities and communities” (Deleuze 1988b, 126). Ethology is about longitude and latitude. A body can be anything. Unformed, a BwO seeks not its form but its potential. Touch operates as the directionality of this seeking. Touch takes place in the intensity of a movement-toward, the body becoming other through relation. “The longitudes and latitudes together constitute Nature, the plane of immanence or consistency, which is always variable and is constantly being altered, composed and recomposed, by individuals and collectivities” (Deleuze 1988b, 128).
