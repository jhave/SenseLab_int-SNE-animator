To restrain desire—to  not reach toward an other—is to be weak. Only the weak are restrained. Desire is energy and “[e]nergy is eternal delight” (Blake 1975, 4, xvi). Desire attracts the devil: “When I came home: on the abyss of the ﬁve senses, where a ﬂat sided steep frowns over the present world, I saw a mighty Devil forded in black clouds” (1975, 6–7, xvii). Desire extends the senses and the senses promise experience, but with experience comes temptation. The choice is violent, but not to choose is to remain passive and to allow oneself to be governed. Temptations are to be lived, to be experienced: “The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom. / Prudence is a rich ugly old maid courted by Incapacity” (1975, 7, xviii). To live is to touch the world. Time is at stake, “Eternity is in love with the productions of time.” With time, as my body changes, my senses become more acute and my life becomes more complex. To live is to time space and space time, unleashing the energies of the sensing and transforming bodies in movement.
