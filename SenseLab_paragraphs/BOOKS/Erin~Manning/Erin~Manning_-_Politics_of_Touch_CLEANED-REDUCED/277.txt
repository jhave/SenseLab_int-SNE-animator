This is not to say that the materiality of bodies is simply and only a linguistic effect which is reducible to a set of signiﬁers. Such a distinction overlooks the materiality of the signiﬁer itself. Such an account also fails to understand materiality as that which is bound up with signiﬁcation from the start; to think through the indissolubility of materiality and signiﬁcation is  no easy matter. To posit by way of language a materiality outside of language is still to posit that materiality, and the materiality so posited will retain that positing as its constitutive condition. (1993, 30)
