Doyle writes:
The very success of the informatic paradigm, in ﬁelds as diverse as molecular biology and ecology, has paradoxically dislocated the very object of biological research.... This “postvital” biology is, by and large, interested less in  the characteristics and functions of living organisms than in sequences of molecules and their effects. These sequences are themselves articulable through databases and networks; they therefore garner their effects through relentless repetitions and refrains, connections and blockages rather than through the autonomous interiority of an organism.
