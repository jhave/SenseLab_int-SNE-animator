When we back-grid, we have a tendency to move toward common sense. Aristotle deﬁnes touch as the common sense. He suggests that all senses are embodied through the single sense of touch. Yet touch is anything but common. Touch reaches toward that which is most uncommon: the will-have-been. Common sense as it is usually understood connotes a consensual politics that decides in advance what are the limits of political qualiﬁcation. Common sense takes for granted a strict equivalence between bodies and the state. To be qualiﬁed politically within the nation-state system is to reside within the iterable bounds of citizenship. In this system, territory and iden- tity are conﬂated, assuring strict narratives of national identity that frame the grids of qualiﬁcation that permit us to speak authoritatively about the state as the organization of space and time. Yet, touch exceeds the state, calling forth that which cannot be securely organized. How, then, are we to consider touch and common sense together? See chapter 5.
