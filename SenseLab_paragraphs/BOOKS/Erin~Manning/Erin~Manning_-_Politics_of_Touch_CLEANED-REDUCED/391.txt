This is a strong argument for the fact that organisms have always already been networks. Marcello Barbieri also argues along these lines, suggesting that living systems must be understood as a tripartite ensemble of genotype, hereditary information primarily although not exclusively born by DNA; ribotype, the swarm of translational apparatuses that transform DNA into the  tertiary  structures  of  folded  proteins;  and  phenotype,  the  dynamic embodiment of this information and its transformations (in Doyle 2003, 23).
