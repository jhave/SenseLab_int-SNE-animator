States and bodies coexist despite their great antipathy. Re-articulating politics implies rethinking governing structures. Bodies disarticulate states. States live in fear of bodies. This is the subject of chapters 2 and 6. Control mechanisms for bodies abound: gender qualiﬁcations (and disqualiﬁcation), discrepancies between the rights of the homed and the homeless, racial inequalities, border patrols, war tactics, sexual stereotypes, election ﬁascos. Spinoza suggests the concept of the pact to think around the issue of states and bodies. Derrida suggests a politics of friendship. Pacts are about collec- tive individuation, about affect and will. To create a pact is to take a deci- sion within a multitude. A politics of friendship proposes the challenge of creating a relation that cannot be symbolized through a coding in a frater- nal nationalism. To create a pact is to explore the limits of what a body can do. It is to take response-ability for an active engagement with structures that mutate. To live is to risk. To risk is to rethink liberty. Liberty must be thought outside the triumvirate: fraternity, liberty, equality. Liberty can become a risk-taking enterprise that foregrounds the potential within any reaching-toward. Liberty  might  be  the freedom  to  touch,  a politics  of friendship with a sensing body in movement.
