Touch is a decision to engender that throws us off balance. A politics of touch asks us to be willing to lose our balance, momentarily, to not know in advance, to disagree.23 Antagonism is at the heart of a politics of touch. When this antagonism remains untheorized, we are left with a politics that understands consensus as the only alternative to antagonism. But if we think of antagonism as a moment when we accept our constitutive difference as a measure of our not being able to “know” (where reason and the senses are no longer associated in opposition), antagonism can be conceived as an aspect of the very Entwurfenheit that characterizes a politics of touch. For Jacques Rancière, political antagonism designates the tension between the structured social body in which each part has its place, and “the part of no part” which unsettles this order on account of the empty principle of universality. For Rancière, this identiﬁcation of the non-part with the whole is the elementary gesture of politicization. The non-part includes the bodies society cannot deﬁne or that resist their allocated subordinate space. Without antagonism we are faced with depoliticization. Antagonism is analogous to the potential violence of in-formation that creates the metastable systems through which individuations can take place. Antagonism opens the way for engenderings.
