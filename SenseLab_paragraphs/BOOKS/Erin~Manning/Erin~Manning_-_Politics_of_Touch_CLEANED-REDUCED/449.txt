I wonder whether it might not be related to the Body without Organs (BwO) that Deleuze and Guattari evoke in A Thousand Plateaux. Let me explain: a body that is always in the potentiality evoked by a reaching- toward is a body that must also always already be beyond its-self. This body is abstract in the sense that it is always virtually becoming its potential. Because there is no end-limit to becoming, this body-in-potential cannot be conceived of as a permanent space-time, but must instead be thought of as an exfoliating movement toward another exfoliating movement. The body as exfoliation cannot be grasped. But it can be thought—abstractly. An as abstract potentiality, this body is not solely contained within an enclosure—skin—which can be organized (tactfully) within a system of governance (a body-politic). The BwO is more than its discrete outside and inside. This body-as-multitude is a strata onto which intensities congregate. A BwO is a body that moves between metastable states, operating, always, within systems of protopermanence that seek to slow or even stop its movement. But even in their slowest instantiations, Bodies without Organs are co-forming so quickly that they cannot be located and secured.
