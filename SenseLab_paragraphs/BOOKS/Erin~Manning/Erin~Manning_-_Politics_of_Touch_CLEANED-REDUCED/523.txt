Inventions abound on the prosthetized posthuman body. Interventions are welcome. It is in this sense that the posthuman body can be associated to a BwO (even a biologically unaltered homo sapiens), especially if we consider the manner in which technologies of sense provide platforms of experience that extend beyond the organism, returning to the organism by altering the form of that organism. Form cannot but be altered: by whatever manner one deÔ¨Ånes form, it is an off procedure since it involves rushing from the conditioned to the condition, in order to think of the condition as the simple possibility of the conditioned. Here one rises to a foundation, but that which is founded remains what it was, independently of the operation which founded it and unaffected by it (Deleuze 1990b, 18)
