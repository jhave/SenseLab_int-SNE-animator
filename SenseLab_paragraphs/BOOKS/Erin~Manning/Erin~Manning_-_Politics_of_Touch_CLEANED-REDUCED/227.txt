Walter Benjamin makes a distinction between two kinds of violence: law-making violence and law-preserving violence (1978, 277). The founding violence is the one that institutes and positions law, the preserving violence is the one that maintains, conﬁrms, and insures the permanence and enforce-ability of the law. This suggests a complication for the state: the state must conceal its own founding violence in order to violently preserve its laws. Violence is inbred into the concept, the formation and the dissemination of state practice.
Foundational violence is the companion to preservational violence. In relation to law, individual violence is prohibited and condemned, not because it poses a threat to the individual as such, but because it profoundly threatens the very juridical order that sustains the state. “Law,” writes Derrida, “has an interest in the monopoly of violence” (1992, 33). This monopoly protects not legal ends, but law itself. Violence threatens from within, operating at the heart of state-sanctioned law-making practices. To think violence as that which does not emerge from the law’s exterior is to understand the implicit violence in state formations: “The foundation of all States occurs in a situation that we can call revolutionary. It inaugurates a new law, it always does so in violence” (Derrida 1992, 35).
