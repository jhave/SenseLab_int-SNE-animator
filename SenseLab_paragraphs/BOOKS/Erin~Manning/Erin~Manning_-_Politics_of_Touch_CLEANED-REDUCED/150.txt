The beginning of the tango scene has Po-Wing leading Lei-Yu Fai into a back step, neither one of them really listening to each other. In frustration, Po-Wing tells Fai to practice his “steps” alone (a sure sign that it is neither tango nor touch they are practicing at the moment). In the following scene, we cut to the sounds of Piazzola and the dock area of Buenos Aires and then return to the kitchen where Po-Wing and Fai hold each other, dancing something between an embrace and a tango, kissing. This sensual moment between the two men, something we have not experienced since the ﬁrst scene of the ﬁlm, frames, momentarily, the touch that has been missing since Po-Wing’s hands were bandaged and Fai refused to touch him. This scene is a recalling at once of the desire of touch in love, in friendship, and our disconsolate ability to be in proximity without contact, without movement, without desire, without touch. This scene recalls the difference between friendship and fraternity.
