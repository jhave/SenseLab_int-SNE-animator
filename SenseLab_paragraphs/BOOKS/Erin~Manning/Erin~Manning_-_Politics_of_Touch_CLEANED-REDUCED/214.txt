The encoding of information through the body’s sense organs is achieved through a relation between body and the environment. Sensory perceptions depend on the world meeting the body as the body becomes world. The senses translate the body not as the individual but as the relational exchange between worlds and bodies. As Gil writes, “[t]he exfoliations of the space of the body, as abstract forms, integrate the information coming from a perceivable body and make possible its translation into a different object belonging to a different sensual sphere” (1998, 25). The exfoliations of touch on the variegated surfaces of the body as space-time result in the disappearance of the One and the appearance of a singular difference in motion that forever deconstructs itself. Exfoliating, the body dissolves into space, becomes space, re-emerges as space.
