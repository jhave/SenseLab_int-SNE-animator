“Starting over” for Lai-Yu Fai and Po-Wing is a complex entwinement of the limits of friendship and love, of distance and desire, of treachery and betrayal, since “starting over” does imply locating the place of the beginning. If we seek beginnings, we will always ﬁnd ourselves — as Lai-Yu Fai and Po-Wing do—at the tremulous intersection between friendship and fraternity, between identity and nationalism, between stagnant homosexualized bodies seeking the ultimate experience of “together-ness.” This is the challenge expressed in the ﬁlm, a challenge wherein the body both yearns for and resists a straitjacket of belonging (in terms of gender, sex, nation) that would monopolize this life either as deviant or unique. This is not a ﬁlm “about” homosexuality and its relation to the speciﬁcities of “home.” It is a ﬁlm that questions the very premise that to speak of homosexuality would be any different than speaking of any other desire across time and space. It is a ﬁlm that cries out for a different way of thinking love, be it in the name of home, of encounter, of experience.
