Tango as a political gesture is the exhibition of the between: between my interpretation and your creation, between my lead and your response. Tango allows the mediality of experience to shine through, exposing the ethical dimension in the relation, celebrating the sphere of that which cannot be known. Of course, not all tango appreciates this challenge. Politics is never simple or straightforward. At its most common, tango replays the drudgery of the deÔ¨Åned roles of self and other, relishing the segregation of sameness. But even then, tango demands a response, a response that can never be accurately predicted.
