A politics of touch cannot be devoid of a concern for “a body,” or for “the body” of the sovereign. The concern remains. What changes is the exposure. A politics of touch suggests that even those bodies who seem to conform to the laws of static Being are potentially becoming: the sovereign would not have the power evoked by his or her presence were it not for the capacity to defy our expectations, to lure us, to capture our thoughts. All bodies are becoming. Static bodies are a myth, a stabilizing projection of the nation-state’s desire to construct an imaginary that can be reproduced only meiotically. The trick here is to ﬁnd a way to relate the static body to that very same body that is becoming. The challenge: to expose affects in their becomings, even when the bodies they inhabit are imposing stability.
