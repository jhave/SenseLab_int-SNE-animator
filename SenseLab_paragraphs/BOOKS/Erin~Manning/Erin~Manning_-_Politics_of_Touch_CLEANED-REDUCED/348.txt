Engendering gender gives us a sense of what a body can do. For Spinoza, a body is not primarily an organism or an organization. It is an assemblage of kinetic particles and forces, of motion and energy. A body is a network of imminent trajectories with longitudinal and latitudinal lines intersecting. This is a radical departure from the Cartesian axis, which situates matter and form in predictable hierarchies, prescribing a pre-established organization of the body in space and time. In Spinoza, matter and form are mutational: what is at stake is the relation between motion and rest and the capacity to affect and be affected. Bodies here exist in a concept of Nature which exposes the coexistence of matter-form unfolding in a continuum without equivalence.
