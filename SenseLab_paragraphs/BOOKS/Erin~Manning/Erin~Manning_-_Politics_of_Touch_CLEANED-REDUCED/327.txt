In the middle of the second tango waltz, I feel the movement beginning to take over our bodies. We begin to individuate together. A relation begins to take form. My body can no longer as easily be distinguished from hers. A symbiosis of movement begins to create engenderings we cannot yet predict. This makes us smile. The music leads us into unusual formations. I lead, she follows, I follow her following, she leads my following. A composition is emerging. Qualitatively, we are altering each other’s matter-form, in-forming ourselves through the relation between movement and music. We operate according to the codes of tango but our improvisation take us into compositions that modulate our reciprocal spacing of time and timing of space.
Reaching toward one another, our individuations qualitatively alter our “individuality.” Transducing, we become our leading and following, no longer altogether clear on who is doing what. The music takes hold of the ﬂoor. We follow the ground, participating in a larger metastable movement. We begin to dance with the room. The dance becomes a symbiosis that affects each couple. The music ends. We laugh, barely capable of containing the magic of the moment, suddenly uncomfortable.
