An emphasis on expression leads us away from a signifying subject to a becoming of relation. Expression is not reserved for the single voice of the speaking subject: expression dialogically produces chronotopes that expand the intervals between speakers and listeners. These intervals are not voids between discrete bodies; they are space-times alive with intonations, invocations, perturbations. To express is not to state a fact. To express is to speak-with. Any speaking-with implies a dialogue, an inﬁnite conversation. An inﬁnite conversation supposes that the work is yet to be invented.
