Friendship that gives and takes time, friendship that survives the living present, is a movement of desire that depends on the unknowability of an other. What Fai tries to steal from Po-Wing is his freedom, but even in taking his passport, all Lai-Yu Fai actually manages to take from Po-Wing is his friendship. For freedom is not so transparent as to exist solely in appearances of dependency such as those of citizenship and inﬁrmity. Freedom may be the opening toward friendship. Friendship is not about home, about identity, about ethnic similarity or cultural appurtenance. Friendship is that which retains unknowable potential because it remains other, unknown, of the present yet-to-come. The impossible schism between democracy (as it is lived within the state-system) and friendship thus becomes apparent: democracy cannot live up to its name without constraining friendship to fraternity. How can a politics of friendship and democracy be reconciled? Derrida writes of this paradox: it is “tragically irreconcilable and forever wounding. The wound itself opens with the necessity of having to count one’s friends, to count an other, in the economy of one’s own, there where every other is altogether other.... But where every other is equally altogether other” (1997, 22).
