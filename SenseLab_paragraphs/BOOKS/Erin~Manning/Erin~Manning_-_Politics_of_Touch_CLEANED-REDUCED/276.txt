What a body can do is a question of engendering. One way of activating this concept is through an exploration of the effects of language, as does Judith Butler in Bodies That Matter: The body posited as prior to the sign, is always posited or signiﬁed as prior. This signiﬁcation produces as an effect of its own procedure the very body that it nevertheless and simultaneously claims to discover as that which precedes its own action. If the body signiﬁed as prior to signiﬁcation is an effect of signiﬁcation, then the mimetic or representational status of language, which claims that signs follow bodies as their necessary mirrors, is not mimetic at all. On the contrary, it is productive, constitutive, one might even argue performative, inasmuch as this signifying act delimits and contours the body that it claims to ﬁnd prior to any and all signiﬁcation.
