Pacts are evocatively political: “every civil society, from the moment it can be thought of as the realization of a pact, is naturally democratic” (Balibar in Montag and Stolze 1997, 184). No populous is original, neither in Nature or in the state. Imaginaries preside over all manifestations of the multitude, including conglomerations of stratiﬁed bodies and Bodies without Organs: “in history there is not a unique form of the democratic imperium, but there are necessarily several: as many as there are ‘regimes’ corresponding to the imaginary representation of the common interest” (Balibar in Montag and Stolze 1997, 184). Within the imaginary representation of the common interest there need be no opposition between bodies, between states, between reason and nonreason. The deviation from imaginary to imaginary is the virtual process through which bodies become bodies in relation with other bodies. It is also the process through which Nature passes into states and states become Nature.
