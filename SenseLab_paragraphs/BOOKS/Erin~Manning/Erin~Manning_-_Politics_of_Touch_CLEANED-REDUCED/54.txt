Tango begins with a music, a rhythm, a melody. The movement of the dance is initiated by a lead, a direction, an opening to which the follower responds. Tango is an exchange that depends on the closeness of two bodies willing to engage with one-another. It is a pact for three minutes, a sensual encounter that guarantees nothing but a listening. And this listening must happen on both sides, for a lead is meaningless if it does not convey a response from a follower. As various tango aÔ¨Åcionados have pointed out, the lead can never be more than an invitation, as a result of which the movement in response will remain improvised. This dialogue is rich and complex, closer to the heart, perhaps, than many exchanges between strangers and lovers.
