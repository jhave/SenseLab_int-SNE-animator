Such friendship gives itself in its withdrawal, in the time it takes to touch. Touch involves a return, a return not to the self-same but to the body as it has shifted through the process of making time and space with an other. This is a politics of modiﬁcation, a politics carried out through an other as much as with an other, a space-fullness that carries within itself the ineluc- table inconsistencies inherent in the composition of timed spaces and spaced times. Friendship challenges linear displacements, offering itself not as a movement from here to there, but as a decision-taking process that reﬂects on everything that remains—and will always remain—to be decided. Friend- ship—a politics of friendship—inhabits the chronotope of the not-yet-decided through which bodies create themselves. A politics of friendship is not a certain state, but a quality in and of movement, a “suspended indeci- sion, the undecidable qua the time of reﬂection” (Derrida 1997, 15). Such a politics is a singular endeavor not to collapse an other into the same, but to bring forth the becoming-political of any reaching toward, the becoming- political as sensation, as decision, as choice. This is a politics in process where the question of democracy (of identity, citizenship, subjectivity) is re-posed not in a static manner, but in movement.
