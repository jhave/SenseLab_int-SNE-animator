Bodies matter in excess of themselves. As matter is potentialized, it actualizes into form. This form plays an in-forming role by exerting forces that limit the actualization of matter’s potential energy. This does not necessarily stop its actualization, but does in-form it. This process overspills the body’s envelope, suggesting that the body always exceeds its-self. When the relationship between form and matter no longer takes place between inert matter and external form, a relation becomes individuated between form and matter that results in engenderings that exceed the parameters of the systems embodied by the limits of force.
