To touch is to share. This sharing takes place as a trace, a detour, an erring. When I touch you I do not contain the experience within a preconceived narrative. To touch is to open us to a story we have not yet heard, to an unworked work, a narrative without a beginning and an end. To touch impenetrably evokes this undecidability of/in time and space, a dilemma of the entre-deux that necessitates both a coming-towards and a coming-between. I cannot envelop the space of our sharing. If I cross this space without regard for this sharing, I engage in a violent accosting that becomes a blow. To touch is to conceive of a simultaneity that requires the courage to face the in-between. When I touch you I reach toward that which I cannot yet deﬁne, a worlding of our own creation. This is a ﬁnite effort, an effort ﬁrmly lodged within a creation of our space-time, within a willed present. I am in con-tact with you. “Touch signiﬁes ‘being in the world’ for a ﬁnite being” (Derrida 2000, 161). There is no world without you.
