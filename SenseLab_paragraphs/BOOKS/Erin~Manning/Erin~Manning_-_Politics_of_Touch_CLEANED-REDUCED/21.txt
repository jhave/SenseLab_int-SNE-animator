Politics of Touch begins with transculturation-in-movement, a concept that exposes the ways in which interweaving cultures depart from the often stultifying narratives of the nation-state. Transculturation comes to the fore in chapter 1 through the specter of Argentine tango, the legacy of a dance that invariably exceeds its parameters, be they cultural or national. Trans- culturation suggests that culture is always more than that which the nation identiﬁes as its imagined community.
Transculturation proposes not only a cultural slippage but also a poten- tial alteration in the relation of space to time. Through tango, transcultura- tion encourages us to rethink the ways in which we touch and move together, and to explore how these movements instantiate new chronotopes. The foregrounding of space-time through the ﬁgure of the chronotope is a way of reminding ourselves that space and time (as deﬁned by the nation-state or by a concept of culture that is embedded in national politics) cannot exist separately. Space and time are always space-time. Bodies in movement space time and time space rather than existing in an empty container of space marked by the passing of a linear time line.
