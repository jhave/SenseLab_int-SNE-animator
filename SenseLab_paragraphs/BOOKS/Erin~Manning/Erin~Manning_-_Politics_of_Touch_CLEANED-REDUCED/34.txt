Mutants connote multiplicity. There is more than one way for a body to become. Multiplicity entails an undermining of the order of the system. Multiplicity is not 1+1. It is 1+ too many to count. The multiple does not simply refer to individuals en masse. The multiple is a rethinking of collective individuation, an agglomeration of Bodies without Organs moving toward each othersâ€™ incorporeality. Collective individuation is about more than community. To collectively individuate is to acknowledge the meta-stability of all machines as assemblages, to acknowledge that all communities are made up of more (kinds of) bodies than we can count.
