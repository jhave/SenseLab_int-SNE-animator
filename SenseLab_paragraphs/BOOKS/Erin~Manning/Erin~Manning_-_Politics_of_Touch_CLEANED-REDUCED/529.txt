I return to my initial question: how do politics secure sense? The better question at this point is perhaps: is security part of the pact(s) of a politics of touch? Security is essential to the sovereign politics of the nation-state. In disciplinary narratives of security, sense is secured in the name of territorialized reason. Even in a globalized world, we can not overlook the manner in which narratives of security continue to conﬁgure our understandings of what it means to live in time and space: whatever the loss of economic autonomy experienced under globalization, sovereignty is not passing away: it forms, instead, a complex and malign articulation of law, power, possibility and force that thwart a totalizing image of decline and irrelevance. Dominant public obsessions are with security and its violent, exclusivist, ontologizing technologies: counterterror, border protection, deterrence, “homeland security,” the “necessary” erosion of civil liberties and the rule of law.
