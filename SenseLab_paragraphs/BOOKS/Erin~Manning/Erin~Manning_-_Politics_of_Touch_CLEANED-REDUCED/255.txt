Jesus exposes himself in relation (to Mary, to Thomas, to God) on a positive logic of emanation. Materiality is intensiﬁed. Your touch goes right through me because there is no “me.” I am not eternal, I am eternally material. Material, I am the metamorphosing body, exposing my-selves to you, to your touch that never quite adheres, that never quite reaches the one I am not yet, the one I will never quite become. “Flesh is the condition of possibility of the qualities of the world, but it is never contained within or deﬁned by those qualities. In this sense it is both a superﬁcial foundation and an immanent transcendence—alien to any dialectic of reality and appearance, or depth and surface” (Hardt 2002, 83).
