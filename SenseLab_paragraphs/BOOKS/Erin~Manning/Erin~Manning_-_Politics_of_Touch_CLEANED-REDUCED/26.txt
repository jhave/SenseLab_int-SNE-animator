Improvisation engenders new concepts. Although operative throughout, improvisation comes to the fore in chapter 4, where gender, engendering, endosymbiosis, and touch come together. Chapter 4 takes as its point of departure the notion that to engender is to conceive of matter and form not as inert and stable but as relationally metastable. I suggest that form and matter regenerate through encounters with one another rather than occupying separate planes: the quality of matter is source of form, element of form. To borrow from Simondon, the transformation of matter-form involves metastable individuations. Metastable individuations foreground the fact that structures never precede individuations. An individuating structure partakes of transduction—the concept at the heart of chapter 4 —which is any process (biological, physical, social, technical) in which in-formation or new taking-form occurs, enabling reiterations of the matter-form matrix. Transduction is individuation in progress: invention. If we think identity, we have returned to a stable body. A moving body—a sensing body—cannot be identiﬁed. It individuates always in excess of its previous identiﬁcations, remaining open to qualitative reiteration.
