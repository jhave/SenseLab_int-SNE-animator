To think about the body is to think about desire in movement. Sensation is the embodiment of this desire. Desire exceeds the “meaning” of the body because it is continually in movement, in process toward the exploration of yet another desire. Desire is insatiable. Desire is the becoming of friendship, the ﬁeld of potential for a sensory meeting between two bodies. Desire is their ﬁeld of immanence.6 Desire is not linear, but a constant re-organization of emergent chronotopes of time and space. As Massumi writes, “It is only by leaving history to reenter the immanence of the ﬁeld of potential that change can occur” (2002a, 77). Change occurs within this immanence, this “perhaps” that is disconsolately dizzying and excruciatingly exciting. And it is this “perhaps” that continues to pull Po-Wing toward Fai despite the apparent closure of Fai’s all-knowing “we’ll see.” This “perhaps” is conﬁgured, in Wong Kar Wei’s Happy Together, as the tango.
