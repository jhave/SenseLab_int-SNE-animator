The body as a sensory modality engages with an other through a touch that exudes potential violence in its desire to transform the space between self and other. What differentiates this from the national body-politic’s organization of the body is the fact that touch as a reaching-toward is a means without an end. There is no ﬁnal destination where touch is concerned. In fact, there is no self or other as such. The body is the intermediary through which I create, with you, the shared space of our touch, our subjectivity-inprocess. Touch as a reaching toward is a gesture of espacement, an instance of the inexorable violence of difference, of the unknowable. Touch is a movement toward an other through which I re-cognize myself differently, spacing time as I time space.
