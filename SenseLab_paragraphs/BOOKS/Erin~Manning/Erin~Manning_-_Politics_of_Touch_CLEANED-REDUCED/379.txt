When time is concentrated solely in the constructed framework of linear present-past-future, we become blind to the potential of the law, disavowing our complicity in the compartmentalizing of justice in terms of a preorchestrated distribution of times and spaces, of grids onto which our bodies are placed and secured. This denial of the violence of law is a disavowal of time’s différance. It is a disavowal of the spacing of the body as it marks time and is marked by the timed spaces it creates. There is no time or space that is not of the body. There is no body that does not rework the parameters through which it operates. There is no law that is not predicated on the manner in which bodies instantiate spaced-times and timed-spaces.
