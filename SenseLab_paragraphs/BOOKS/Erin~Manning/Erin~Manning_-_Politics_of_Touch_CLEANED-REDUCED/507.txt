A politics of touch cannot be about moral harmony. Bodies without Organs do not necessarily get along. Neither is this about subjectivity. It is about intensity, about potential relations. Affections can slow down the body as much as they can activate it. Before bodies are anything, they are renewable. Politics of touch are composite politics, politics composed of inﬁnite variances of affects, politics reaching toward not an end but a means. An expressive politics ﬁnds no ultimate correspondence. A politics of touch is a concatenation of various effects. Perhaps the way to think a politics of touch is to conceive of a machine proliferating insistently against and beyond whatever you imagine politics of touch already to be. A politics of touch is adjacent, relational: it never stands alone. This machine does not necessarily correspond to politics as you meant to invent it, but it does feed on your imagination, on the invention you are yourself becoming. A politics of touch is every time in every instance a different and differing politics. In this regard, a politics of touch stands alongside Spinoza’s complex assessment of Nature as that which is always already “physical”: “a physics of intensive quantity corresponding to modal essences; a physics of extensive quantity, that is, a mechanism through which modes themselves come into existence; a physics of force, that is, a dynamism through which essence asserts itself in existence, espousing the variations of the power of action” (Deleuze 1990a, 233).
