Agamben writes, “because being-in-language is not something that could be said in sentences, the gesture is essentially always a gesture of not being able to ﬁgure something out in language” (2000, 58). The gesture of turning to an other, of inventing a movement with another whom I do not know and cannot anticipate, is a gesture attentive to a resounding silence, in which I am exposed as a body in motion. In the case of tango, my language is what I reveal to you in the intimacy of the embrace, a language that introduces you to a movement that invites you to respond to a direction we initiate together.
