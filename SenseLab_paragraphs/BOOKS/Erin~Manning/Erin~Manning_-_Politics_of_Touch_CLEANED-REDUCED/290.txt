A politics of touch is composed of engendered and engendering bodies. To engender is to explore the potentialities of form and matter at the level of individuations rather than identities. To engender is to reach toward bodies that are not pre-deﬁned as gendered, not pre-constituted within static representations that beﬁt the systems in which they operate. Engendering bodies are bodies that move, that metamorphose always in relation to their environments and to one another. Engendering bodies are relational vectors that space time and time space in an effort to re-locate themselves within systems of mutation.
