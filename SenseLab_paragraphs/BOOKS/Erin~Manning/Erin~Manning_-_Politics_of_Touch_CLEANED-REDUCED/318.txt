Cellular biology provides a vocabulary through which we can learn to identify how genders are codiﬁed through evolutionary practices. The adoption of one evolutionary model over an other may lead us to think that genders are already deﬁned as concrete processes of chromosomal truth. Endosymbiosis alerts us to ways in which selection happens on another level entirely, focusing not on gendered practices of selection as a primary criterion for reproduction, but on symbiotic engenderings. An engagement with this literature may allow us to better locate the ways in which gendered practices are taken for granted in everyday life.
Evolution is violent, all-consuming, world-altering. The constitutive violence that exists at the heart of engenderings is always operative in the relation between matter and form. Violence happens at all levels: this is a lesson cellular biology teaches us. Engenderings are not straightforward. Alterations cause mutations. Mutations cause infestations. Infestations become populations. But this is a violence at the level of individuation, not identity. Violence of individuation creates potential energy. Violence here operates as a denominator for instability: systems of individuation are volatile. Matter and form interact in an exchange that is not based on individual equality. Engenderings take form in ways that must always remain unpredictable, contingent on the environments through which they individuate.
