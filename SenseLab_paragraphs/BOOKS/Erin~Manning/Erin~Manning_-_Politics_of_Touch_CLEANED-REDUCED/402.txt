What I do have when I reach out to touch you is an idea. In his writing on democracy-to-come, Derrida foregrounds the notion of the idea:
We already have some “idea” of what “democracy” should mean, and what it will have already meant —and the idea, the ideal, the Greek eidos or the idea also designates the turn of a contour, the limit surrounding a visible form.Did we not have some idea of democracy, we would never worry about its indetermination. We would never seek to elucidate its meaning or, indeed, call for its advent. (2005, 18)
