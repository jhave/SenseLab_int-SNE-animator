Engenderings are crossings-over of matter-form from differing realms, be they political, technological, or biological. “The mutations of a body are not predetermined by a given ideal or an infrastructure deﬁning the realm of biological possibilities of a body.... [T]hese mutations designate the abstract or virtual operations of matter” (Parisi 2004, 14). Potential leads to actualization. Engenderings are actualizations of morphing body-mutations. Within each engendering is a virtual form. Actualization through engendering does not derive from pre-determined (already-formed) individuals: it incorporates the formation of new body-conﬁgurations.
