There is nothing unique in this relation between Po-Wing and Fai of friendship and love and yet it is absolutely singular. It is a relation like all others and a relation that plays itself out in the speciÔ¨Åc creative dimensions available to these two homosexuals from Hong Kong living in Buenos Aires, a relation that seeks its bearings in the space-time between two moving bodies who desire to move in rhythm with a world that challenges this very idea of motion. This is a contradictory desire that produces a friendship at once homesick for an impossible fraternity (of home, love, friendship) yet aware, ultimately, that fraternity can be nothing but the erasure of the multiplicity which both men seek, in their very different ways. Via this contradiction, a politics of friendship is evoked in Happy Together, a politics of sensation that is not arrived to but toward, which each character hesitantly moves while trying to re-locate himself in a space-time that calls for continued movement and re-positioning.
