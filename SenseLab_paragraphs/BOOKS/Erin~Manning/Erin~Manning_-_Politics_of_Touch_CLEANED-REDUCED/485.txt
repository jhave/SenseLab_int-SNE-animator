The selection of signs or affects as the primary condition for the birth of the concept does not merely imply the personal effort each person must make   on their own behalf (Reason), but a passional struggle, an inexpiable affective combat one risks dying from, in which signs confront signs and affects clash with affects in order that a little joy might be saved that could make us leave the shadow and change kind. The cries of the language of signs are the mark of this battle of the passions, of joys and sadnesses, of increases and decreases of power. (Deleuze in Montag and Stolze 1997, 27)
