Gregg Lambert suggests that the body of woman in the early Christian community marks “the site of touching and the fear of being touched,... the site of this extreme contradiction... between a body that is open to the touch and a body that is determined by the prohibition against touching” (2004, 4). Mary Magdalene is no exception. In Mark 16:1, it is reported that Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James went to the tomb with spices to anoint the body of Jesus. Against all restrictions around touch, these women go to the grave to touch and handle a corpse.
Despite echoes to the contrary voiced in The Gospel of Mary Magdalene,17 Mary Magdalene remains the biblical embodiment of ﬂesh and of the carnal body in the Hebrew Bible. It is in the shadow of her ﬂeshy body that Jesus reveals himself. It is with her that Jesus speaks of touch. It is toward her that Jesus becomes untouchable. It is alongside her that Jesus circumvents the violence of touch. Mary is touch embodied; she is the woman who reaches toward touch as untouchability. She is the body that opens itself toward the body of Jesus, allowing him to take leave, allowing him to take a place within her, to become her. It is Mary who is asked to relay the Gospel; it is Mary who is asked to have faith that to touch is always to reach toward untouchability. It is Mary who discerns what is at stake in the complicated politics of touch at work in the Bible. As Nancy writes, “[t]his violent paradox is not to be resolved, it remains the location of a gap as intimate as it is irreducible: do not touch me.” Mary is the incarnation of this interval, the body of woman who accepts the violence inherent in the decision to touch or not to touch, who lives the complexity of the engagement with the unknowable, the indeﬁnable.
