Politics of touch space time and time space in such a way as to make them indiscernible. They are never what they once were. I cannot locate politics in space and time. I create space and time politically. Space times and time spaces, generating Bodies without Organs. Bodies without Organs emerge through encounters that modulate such concepts as action, reason, freedom. “Reason, strength and freedom are in Spinoza inseparable from a development, a formative process, a culture. Nobody is born free, nobody is born reasonable” (Deleuze 1990a, 262).13
Predictable dichotomies are no longer evident: body/soul, reason/senses, nature/culture. Politics of touch make relational pacts. It becomes a question of compatibility and extension. Building Bodies without Organs that correspond to some kind of reasonable common-sense politics requires encounters with those whose Bodies without Organs circulate around concepts that promote this kind of reason. This is not impossible. In fact, it is common. What is uncommon is realizing that even those Bodies without Organs that seek to organize their intensities around concepts such as reason are themselves continually destratiﬁed in sensual relations to nonsense.
