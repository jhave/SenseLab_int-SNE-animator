Democratic politics is an event. An event is the reversal of the Platonic gesture toward essence and the substitution of movements of singularities.15 The event-ness of democracy opens the way for disagreement, for choice, for accidents. Politics is not something to be solved. Solutions “make sense” only when problems are prelocated within a logic of solutions. Politics focused on solutions is policy or police. A politics of touch does not yearn for solutions, but moves toward disagreement. This does not mean that a politics of touch does not learn. Knowledge imprints itself and is imprinted onto a democratic politics. The difference is that a politics of touch focuses on the redistributions of singularities rather than on results, each combination an event. “[S]ense,” writes Deleuze, “is never a principle or an origin, but... is produced. It is not something to discover, to restore, and to re-employ, it is something to produce by a new machinery” (1990b, 72). Democratic politics is one way to produce sense, to make sense of relations of emergence between sensing bodies in movement. Sense and senses are surface effects, that is, they are inseparable from the surfaces (the bodies) that are their proper dimensions. Senses are not about ﬁxed meaning, but about discovery, about reaching-toward, about relation. “Today’s task is to make the empty square circulate and to make pre-individual and nonpersonal singularities speak— that is, to produce sense” (Deleuze 1990b, 73). The distributions of sense are not linear: democratic spaced-times and timed-spaces must resist returning to teleological models of identity, territory, history: The paradoxes of sense are essentially that of the subdivision ad inﬁnitum (always past-future and never present), and that of the nomadic distribution (distributing in an open space instead of distributing in a closed space).
