Within political thought, politics has most often been conceived of as signifying. A politics of touch posits politics as asignifying, inviting us to think politics through its potential for expression rather than representation. Expression articulates a body that is not foreclosed by meaning. This body is a sensing body in movement. Sensing, signiﬁcation becomes mutational. A mutational politics might be an abstract machine, an asignifying dynamic, a tensile ethics. Politics of touch prolongs emergent dynamics. “There is no entity to expression.[. . .] Its emerging into words and things is always an event before it is a designation, manifestation or signiﬁcation propositionally attached to a subject” (Massumi 2002b, xxiii–xxiv). Expression produces momentum.
