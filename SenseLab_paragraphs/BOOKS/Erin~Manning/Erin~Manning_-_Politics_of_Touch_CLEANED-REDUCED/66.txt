Agamben suggests that gesture is “that dimension of language that is not exhausted in any communication of meaning and that, in this way, marks the point at which language appears in its mere capacity to communicate” (1999, 22). To foreground gesture is to consider a community inconceivable according to any representable condition of belonging: a “coming community,” without identity, deﬁned by nothing other than its existence in language as irreducible, absolute potentiality. (Agamben 1999, 23)
