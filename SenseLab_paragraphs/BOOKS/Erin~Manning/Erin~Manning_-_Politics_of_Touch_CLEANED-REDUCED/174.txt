Friendship is human, it is of the world, it worlds. Friendship is political, it is a reminder that all thought, all sense, all touch, all language is for and toward an other. As Derrida writes, “there is thinking being—if, at least, thought must be thought of an other—only in friendship....I think, therefore I am an other; I think, therefore I need an other (in order to think)” (1997, 224). Friendship is a movement of sensation, a politics of touch that challenges me to (mis)count myself as other. Friendship is a condition of emergence, it is where my senses lead me, it is the fold of experience out of which a certain politics is born. Friendship is a space of experience, “a topological hyperspace of transformation” (Massumi 2002, 184). Not a phenomenology, and certainly not a return “home.”
