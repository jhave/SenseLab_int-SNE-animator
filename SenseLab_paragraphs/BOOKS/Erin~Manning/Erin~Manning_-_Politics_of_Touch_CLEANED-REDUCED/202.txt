Gil suggests that of all languages, it is only articulated language that fully realizes the code of translation: “Because it is a metalanguage, it can handle all the codes, create metaphors, move from one domain to an other; assemble them and pull them apart” (1998, 5). Body “language” does not operate as a metalanguage, however: “the body does not speak, it makes speech” (1998, 5). Sensing, the body responds to various strata and textures of articulation and gesture, incorporating and excreting the myriad incongruities of any encounter, be it sensual and/or textual, with an other. It is therefore a fallacy to consider the body linguistically without acknowledging the complex layering of the senses, for the body is, ﬁrst and foremost, a sensual apparatus of movement toward the world, a sensing body-in-motion that worlds. This is not to undermine the importance of a textual language of gesture, or of a “grammar” of the body, but rather to underscore the importance of conceiving the body as movement.
