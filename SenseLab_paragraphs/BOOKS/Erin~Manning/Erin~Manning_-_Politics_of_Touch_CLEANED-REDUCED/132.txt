ment with ourselves and each other that is a politics of touch, this is not a world easy to navigate. It demands a constant awareness, a reciprocity in action and thought, a movement that can become terribly exhausting. It is easier to stop, to buy the lamp, to build walls to keep each other out, to speak of nations and national identity, to speak of difference as though it could be categorized, organized, located in its sameness. The world of movement (what other world is there?) is a dangerous world of incommensurable bodies-in-motion, of sensualities and sensings, of difÔ¨Åcult friendships-in- process, of miraculation.
