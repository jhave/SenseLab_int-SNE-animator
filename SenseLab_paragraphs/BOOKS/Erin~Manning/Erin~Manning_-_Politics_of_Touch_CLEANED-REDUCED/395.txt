Within much political thought, bodies are written into narratives that subsume identity and territory in the name of a coherence of time and space pre-imposed onto the body as formed matter. Mediation in this instance refers to pre-written narratives interrupted by lines of communication. Yet skins do more than replicate a rehearsed scene of writing. Skins are corporeographic: they sign the body in directions (in and out and beyond) that we cannot fathom. I write my body differently through each overlapping of sense. I split, virtually. When I touch, I inscribe my skin onto yours and remain imprinted, forever changing the dynamic of my own writing. Representation becomes sensible, sensitized by my act of reaching toward a judgment yet-to-come, toward a time when judgment may be aporetic, waiting for the touch that never quite arrives. Biology is not all there is to skin: skin is the drama of the bodyâ€™s re-markability.
