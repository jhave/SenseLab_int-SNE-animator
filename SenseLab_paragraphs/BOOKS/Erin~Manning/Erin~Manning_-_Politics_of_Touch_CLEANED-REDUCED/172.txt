Chang arrives at Ushuaia, at the lighthouse that is the end of his journey:
July 1997. I ﬁnally arrive at the end of the world. I left Taipei because I hated home. I always have to serve at the stall. Actually, serving at the stall isn’t  so bad. I made a fool of myself. I feel very happy. I promised Fai to leave his sadness here. I don’t know what he said that night. Maybe the recorder broke down. Nothing is on the tape. Only a couple of strange noises like someone sobbing.
