The Marriage of Heaven and Hell is a series of plates that explores in detail the shortcomings of narratives that seek to dichotomize experience. Contraries prevail, giving rise to the concepts of good and evil. “Good is the passive that obeys Reason. Evil is the active springing from Energy / Good is Heaven. Evil is Hell” (Blake 1975, 3, xvi). As long as good and evil are opposed, the stakes are clear and God’s word—the sovereign voice—takes charge over insensate bodies. But perhaps good and evil are not opposed, warns Blake in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, going on to point out the many errors found in the Bible. Among them is the dichotomy between body and soul, wherein evil energy stems from the body and good reason is of the soul.
