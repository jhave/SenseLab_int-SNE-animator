This, according to Feldman, “involves the setting up of novel codifying apparatuses such as the reorganization of the senses, mental maps, topographic origin myths, norms of spatial competence, and rites of spatial performance” (1991, 9). Space-time is what is at stake here, not of the body, but as the body. It is now that we witness the productive capacities of touch, even if we consider touch linked to a certain violence. Touch crosses space and/as the body, calling forth not only a reciprocity but attesting to space-time as that which does not exist between bodies, but which is formed through the movements of these very bodies. Space-time, understood this way, is the very possibility of a sensory re-articulation of the political: space is no longer reserved for the vocabulary of the nation-state, which cannot understand chronotopes otherwise than as pre-existent striated operations of identity and territory that feed its stultifying imaginary. The state apparatus striates space-time in a refusal to acknowledge the continual creation and transformation of the sensing, moving bodies in its midst. Were it to do otherwise, the state would risk losing its perceived hegemony over its body-politic.
