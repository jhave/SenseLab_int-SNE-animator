Tango speaks a complex language, especially when it exceeds a passive engagement with an other. In these instances, tango produces an encounter with an other that challenges ordinary politics of belonging. Reaching toward you, we create a world encapsulated in an improvised encounter that must always resist the notion of a fundamental accomplishment. The politics of touch experienced in and through tango are always, in some sense, inaccessible politics. Tango is a dance that eludes me even as I move toward you, touching you with my desire to communicate, to inter-relate. Born of dis-illusionment and disorientation, the music and dance of migration and immigration, of love and loss, tango lends its name to all forms of exile and post-national attachments. There are no origins to this dance that must always return to new begettings, to different and surprising encounters. “If tango has a history,” writes Pierre Monette, “it is all it has: this is why we constantly return to it. This music of the deterritorialized has no other geography than that of errancy” (1995, 332).
