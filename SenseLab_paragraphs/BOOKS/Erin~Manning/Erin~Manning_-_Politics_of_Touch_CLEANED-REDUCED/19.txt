An invention can only ever be a work in progress. A politics of touch acknowledges in advance the impossibility of creating a body per se. To iden- tify a body as such would be to tame movement. To capture movement is to stop sensing. Politics of Touch works with the paradox that a sensing body in movement will always circumvent a project that attempts to characterize it in the name of touch, the senses, gender, race, politics. I accept this paradox and offer Politics of Touch not as a reading of what touch is, but as an explo- ration of what might happen if we are willing to direct our thinking toward movement, toward a relational stance that makes it impossible to pin down knowledge but asks us instead to invent.
