Joy is for Spinoza the truly ethical sense: “A philosophy of pure afﬁrmation, the Ethics is also a philosophy of the joy corresponding to such afﬁrmation” (Deleuze 1990a, 272). A politics of touch is joyfully creative. It is a politics of afﬁrmation. Most politics make a Descartes move, stopping at representation. For Descartes, it is the representative content of ideas that is at stake, as well as the form of the psychological consciousness that thinks these ideas. With only an extrinsic characterization of represented ideas, we get no further than the extrinsic characteristics of Being. Spinoza thinks politics otherwise, beginning not with representation but with the potential of afﬁrmation. For Spinoza, what is at stake is the immanent content of ideas, not perfection, reality, or causality, but the surprise of not knowing what a body can do. Noncausal correspondence is at the heart of a politics of touch. When we speak of noncausal correspondence, we are no longer talking about “the law” or “the sovereign.” We are now speaking about the intensities that populate these concepts and the ways in which they interrelate. It is not about how sovereign politics holds us captive within its nationalist imaginaries, but about how we affect those imaginaries every day as we re-populate our Bodies without Organs.
