A politics of touch is at the mercy of encounters. Insecure, a politics of touch must actualize its power, again and again. This actualization is as virtual as it is actual. It forms as in the crystal. We actualize, we move, we virtualize, we move, we actualize. The relation cannot be secured. Security happens only in the stopping. There is no stable point where I am fully stopped. I rest to move to rest to move, always relationally. “My power is itself actual, because the affections that I experience each moment, whatever these may be, have full right to determine and exercise it” (Deleuze 1990a, 260). This is where the pact comes in. I organize my encounter according to what is useful.
