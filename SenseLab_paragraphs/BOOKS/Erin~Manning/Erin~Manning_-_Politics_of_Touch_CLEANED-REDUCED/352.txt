Engendering challenges the governing body-politic by questioning the regulation of its politicized and depoliticized bodies. Engendering does violence to the state by substituting the concept of identity with individuation. Bodies can no longer be located strictly within territorial grids. Engendering and engendered, we do not stand at an instrumental distance from the terms from which we experience a violation. We individuate in relation. Relation does violence to identity.
Heidegger’s name for this act of violent imposition is Entwurf, a term that draws attention to the manner in which we make sense of a situation into which we are thrown, due to which we ﬁnd ourselves disoriented. Touching across time and space can be an unhinging experience, particularly if we take full account of the manner in which the touch of an other manifests itself across our body, expanding the dimensions of our environments, marking the intervals between our engenderings, dis-covering the measures of our symbioses. Butler understands this moment of Entwurf as one of radical undecidability, the state prior to a decision in which one can never reach a “pure” context, since every context is “always already” retroactively constituted by a decision. My reaching across space and time to touch you is, in this sense, an Entwurf.
