Deleuze writes: “A mode ceases to exist when it can no longer maintain between its parts the relation that characterizes it and it ceases to exist when ‘it is rendered completely incapable of being affected in many ways’” (1990a, 218). Modes are transient. A politics of touch is only as productive as its BwO. There are no guarantees. A body’s structure depends on the composition of its relations. “What a body can do corresponds to the nature and limits of its capacity to be affected” (Deleuze 1990a, 218). Modes are composed of extensive parts that are affected and determined by intensities traveling through them. Every existing mode is affected by modes adjacent to it. Every existing mode is altered by its relation to other modes. Politics of touch are emergent politics dependent on the vectors of interrelation externalized on the strata of the various Bodies without Organs in its environments. Politics of touch are ethological.
