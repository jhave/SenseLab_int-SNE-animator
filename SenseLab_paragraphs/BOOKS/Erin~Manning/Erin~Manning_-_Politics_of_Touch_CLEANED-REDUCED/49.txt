Tango is the dance of the impromptu rethinking of the politics of communication. Tango is the dream of the known played out in the night of the unknown. It is the politics unwritten, yet the palimpsest on which everything political aspires already to have been written. It is the voice of the immigrant displaced through movement. It is the movement of the stranger, echoing in the distant resonance of a music that has many times crossed the world. Foregrounding this improvisational nature of a dance which requests the complete attention of an other, I shall draw a link between the trans-culturation of a movement of desire—tango—and the possibility of articulating a politics enunciated through such displacement. This I will call a politics of touch.
