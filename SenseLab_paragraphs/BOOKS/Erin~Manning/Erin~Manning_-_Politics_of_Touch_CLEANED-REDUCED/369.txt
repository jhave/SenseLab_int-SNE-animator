Politics has been invested in the narrative of signiﬁcation since its metaphysical beginnings. By metaphysical, I am referring to a privileging of a certain organization of time that casts an opposition between the temporal and the atemporal, the eternal and the transitory, the ﬁnite and the inﬁnite, the transcendental and the empirical. This kind of political time (what Michael Shapiro calls national time4) refutes the potential of time to express, to reach toward, to pace space. If we relinquish this imaginary of time, what remains is a kind of radical ﬁnitude, a living-toward-death, a movement of thought, a skinscape, a politics of touch, a certain virtual becoming that opens the way for a thinking of a democracy-to-come.
