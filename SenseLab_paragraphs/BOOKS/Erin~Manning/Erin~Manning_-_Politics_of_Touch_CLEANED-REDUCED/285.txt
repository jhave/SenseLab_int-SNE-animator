This sharing of touch in Argentine tango can also cross heterosexualized gender boundaries which makes it potentially all the more compelling. In the early years of tango, mainly due to the extreme lack of women in Buenos Aires and the stark competition between men, men danced with one another and perfected their tango before they had the opportunity to dance with a woman. Today, especially in Northern Europe, more and more women lead other women (or men), and it is not unusual to see two men dancing together. When Argentine tango shifts into this zone, a politics of touch can take place that challenges the strict boundaries of gender. This happens through a conceptual repositioning of the relation between bodies, which, in turn, alters the qualitative composition of matter-form. Now, the “body” of the leader is no longer composed solely of stereotypical “male” attributes (a macho posture, a sense of control), nor is the follower constrained to stereotypical “feminine” traits (a sexy demeanor, a fairy-like lightness). The ritual of tango as it is often popularized begins to dissolve. Bodies begin to morph. This mutation qualitatively alters the relation between form and matter in these engendering bodies, investing them with new qualities. These new qualities in turn alter the relation between the bodies, modifying their potential movement. As the bodies qualitatively metamorphose, so does the relation between the form and matter of these bodies. At the physical level, this may be noticed in a gesture, a posture, a hold, a glance.
