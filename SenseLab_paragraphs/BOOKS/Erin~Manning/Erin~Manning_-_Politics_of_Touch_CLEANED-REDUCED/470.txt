Why BwO? Can’t we simply retain the body? Rewrite it? Certainly, but not before dismantling it, whatever “it” is. This is a work in progress. Or more precisely, a work in potentia. This is a work that incites us to ﬁnd concepts that make us stumble in order to ask, once more, what “a body” can do. The BwO is expressive. “We do not know even know what a body can do,” writes Spinoza (in Deleuze 1988b, 17–18). As Nietzsche says, we are surprised about conscience, but what is really surprising is the body (in Deleuze 1988b, 18).
