Though Butler does point out that bodies never completely comply with the norms of their gendering, her work does not foreground the ways in which bodies create and alter formations of space-time. To speak of engendering is to qualitatively alter the ways in which matter and form are theorized. Bodies do matter, but perhaps not solely in the way outlined within Butlerâ€™s narratives of gender.
