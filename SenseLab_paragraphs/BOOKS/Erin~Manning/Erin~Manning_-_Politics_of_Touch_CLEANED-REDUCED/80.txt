The space-time of my body touching yours is a spacing, an espacement, before it is a space. It opens toward an opening, an interval, an incorporeal  surface. To touch, in this context, implies modifying, changing, displacing, questioning, inciting a movement which is always a kinetic experience before it is a concrete articulation. Touching is a directionality toward a body which has-not-yet-become, not a body in stasis, but a body moved and moving. I touch what I cannot quite reach, I am touched by an other I cannot quite comprehend, I abstain from touching what I touch with an abstinence that holds within itself the desire to touch, to feel, to sense you.
