“Touching the goal” [scoring] is to risk missing it. But an origin is not a goal. The End, like the Principle, is a form of an other. To touch an origin [to  begin], is not to miss it: it is to properly expose ourselves to it.... We touch ourselves inasmuch as we exist. To touch (ourselves) is what renders us “us” and there is no other secret to discover or to hide behind the touch itself, behind the “with” of co-existence. (Nancy 1996, 32–33)
