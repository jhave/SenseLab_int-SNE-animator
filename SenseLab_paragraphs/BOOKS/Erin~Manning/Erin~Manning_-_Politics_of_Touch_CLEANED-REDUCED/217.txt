Touch as the “common sense” draws us back to the political realm of the state’s res publica and its consensus-based practices of inclusion and exclusion. It recalls also the uncanny shift between consent and consensus, as it is usually deﬁned. “Common sense” in the Aristotelian sense is closer to con-sent in its etymology of with-sense. Yet, both these terms are usurped within politics to symbolize a gathering of the like-minded. Common sense, like consensus, is often associated with a politics that makes assumptions about its constituents’ knowledge base, a certain afﬁliation within a predeﬁned political group. Common sense is too often the dream of consensus that propels the imaginary of the nation and its adjacent narratives of identity and territory. “For the common good” is the practice and the promise of consensus-based politics. Jürgen Habermas’s public sphere and Charles Taylor’s politics of recognition come to mind here.
