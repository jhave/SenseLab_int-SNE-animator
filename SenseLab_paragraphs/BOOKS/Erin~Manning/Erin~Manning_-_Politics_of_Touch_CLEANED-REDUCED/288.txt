While gender subsists within the term “engendering,” it is not etymologically located within its deﬁnition. “Engender” stems from the Middle English engendren, from Middle French engendrer, from Latin ingenerare, from in- + generare, to generate, dating back to the fourteenth century. To engender is to undertake a reworking of form. To engender is to potentialize matter. Engendering involves potentiality at its most fertile: it calls forth the link between the incorporeal and the material, between the virtual and the actual. Engendering takes place in the magic moment between potentiality and actuality, where what is exposed is the actuality of the virtual and the virtuality of the actual. In this eventful moment, bodies morphing toward new forms of matter qualitatively become more than them-selves.
