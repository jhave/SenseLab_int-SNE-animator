The corporeal is showing new kinds of evidence. Increasingly, human tissue is becoming an incorporation of complex weaves of dacron, silicon, and metal. Biology is in dialogue with edible chemistries of hybrid derivation, as electronic circuitries measure the pulse and possibility of life.8 This era of the always already technologized body is not an era devoid of touch. In fact, touch as a prosthetic device is being multiplied at the rate at which skins are being produced. Customized instrumentation, such as data gloves and haptic interfaces, to name but a few sense systems, are reorienting technology toward touch, introducing new ways of thinking about touch, gesture, interaction, and movement. These sensory mechanisms carry their own problematic pasts, at once displacing entrenched histories of the organic human body and delimiting new technologies for complicated and problematic usages by the military, where they are often assimilated into assemblages of control and surveillance. Be that as it may, there is no doubt that touch—and its politics—is continuing to frame our investment in our bodies and our skins.
