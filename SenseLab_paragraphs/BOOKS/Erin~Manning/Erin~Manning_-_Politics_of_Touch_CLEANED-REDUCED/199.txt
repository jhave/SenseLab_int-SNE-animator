Critiques of violence are not without violence. My exploration of a politics of touch is a potentially violent encounter with the unknowable. This is not a (potential) violence I want to condemn. If we think of a violence that moves in more than one direction—a violence quite different from that sustained within the hierarchical system of sovereignty and security ordained by the nation-state—violence need not necessarily be considered a threat to difference. Rather, violence can work as a reminder of that very difference that prevents me from being subsumed into the self-same. Violence can be a manner of writing a body that deﬁes the imposition of stability, that challenges space and time through its sensuality. The body, seen as a potential site of a violence of touch can be conceived of as an exfoliation in the sense José Gil gives the term. The body exfoliates by always already unfolding into the spaces it occupies (1998, ix). This is a state of violence insomuch as it is an infralanguage that speaks through and across the body, creating multiplicities and discontinuities both in my living, sensing body, and in yours, when I reach out toward you.
