Democracy is at stake throughout, though dealt with speciﬁcally in chapters 5 and 6. To think politics today is probably to grapple with democracy. Within Politics of Touch, democracy is foregrounded as democracy-to-come. Alongside Derrida, I suggest that democracy must be thought in the future anterior as that which remains (and will always remain) to be invented. A politics of touch is an exploration of a ﬂeshy democracy. A ﬂeshy democracy implies a political engagement that is as ﬂexible and unpredictable as the machines it sustains and builds. This kind of democracy challenges discourses of security as they are maintained in the name of state sovereignty today. Sensing bodies in movement resist codings of state security by complicating the strict boundaries between inside and outside. What is the inside/outside of a skinscape that folds in and out of an exfoliating body? Where is the inside/outside of a collective individuation? If you cannot have a state without security, you cannot have a sensing body in movement and a state. Not without control mechanisms to hold a body in (its) place.
