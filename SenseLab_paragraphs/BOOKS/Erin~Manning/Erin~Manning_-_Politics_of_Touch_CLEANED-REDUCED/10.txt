Argentine tango functions throughout Politics of Touch as a refrain (in the Deleuzo-Guattarian sense).1 Through the tango, I have attempted to make the point that touch is not simply the laying of hands. Touch is the act of reaching toward, of creating space-time through the worlding that occurs when bodies move. Touch, seen this way, is not simply an addendum to an already-stable body. Touch is that which forces us to think bodies alongside notions such as repetition, prosthesis, extension. This is why Deleuze and Guattariâ€™s concept of the Body without Organs (a concept that forces us to rethink the boundaries of the body) takes central stage toward the end of Politics of Touch.
