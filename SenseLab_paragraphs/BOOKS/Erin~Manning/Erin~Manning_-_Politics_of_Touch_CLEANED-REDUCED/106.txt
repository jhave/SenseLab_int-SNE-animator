In Happy Together, Wong Kar Wai produces an uneasy map of bodies sensing across time and space. In the work that follows, I explore the potential of sensation to produce what I will call a politics of friendship, a politics of touch that reaches toward an other in a movement of desire. Wong Kar Wai’s ﬁlm enables this dialogue between sensation and friendship, between movement and multiplicity, by refuting all easy engagements with the issues it frames: migration, sexuality, movement, tourism, belonging, home. There will be no easy return, in Wong Kar Wai’s Happy Together, to an original myth of homosexuality, an original begetting of Asian beginnings crossing into the mythologized passions of the tango. What we will locate instead are multiplicities that challenge these very categories by exposing the body not as a point on the grid of experience, but as an experience, a sensation, that creates the chronotopes through which it navigates.
