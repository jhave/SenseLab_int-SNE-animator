Politics is dissensus, where dissensus is not the confrontation between interests or opinions but the manifestation of a creative engagement. Dissensus is the productive element that allows our worlding to occur: when I reach out to touch you, my gesture will not reinstate a forgotten commonality. Together, we negotiate inﬂuence. Dissensus rejects any pre-constituted communicative subjectivity. At the heart of dissensus is the realization that I am not yet. Consensus, on an other hand, is the assumption not only that I exist, but that I can convince you to recognize yourself in my image. Consensus is the end of politics of touch, the silencing of disagreement, the impossibility of difference. It is, as Rancière notes, “simply the return of the ‘normal’ state of things which is that of politics’ non-existence” (2001, 14).
