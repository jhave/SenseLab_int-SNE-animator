Departing from Darwinian and neo-Darwinian models that privilege sexual reproduction through heterosexual coupling as experienced by most animals and plants (meiotic sex), Margulis focuses on symbiosis, arguing that it is symbiosis that made our kind of reproductive sex (meiosis) possible. Symbiosis challenges the view that evolution is a competition among individuals where natural selection weeds out the weak individuals, leaving only the strong ones to survive. SET (Serial Endosymbiotic Theory) argues that the concept of the “individual” is misleading since, while the cells that come together to make a whole may be genetically related, more often “the ‘individual’ is composed of fused elements that are genetically distinct” (Margulis and Sagan 1997, 111).
