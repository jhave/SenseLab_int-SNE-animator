What happens to this schema if we emphasize the potential of engendering rather than positing gender as an already-deÔ¨Åned category? The national body-politic is organized around understandings of the body that pre-suppose a state of stability between matter and form. Within this stable system where identity is subsumed onto territory, and space and time are pre-existent, relationships are not permitted to escape the boundedness of their placings within time and space. Engendering exposes the mythical status of this dependence on conformity by calling forth a concept of relation that actively alters time and space as it points to the ways bodies produce matter and form. Because relation implies individuation and transduction, relation cannot as easily be located within the grids of the nation-state. Relation entails a new thinking of politics. Politics of Being are state politics. Politics of relation are politics of touch.
