If we understand the political as that which operates in the space of indistinction between friendship and democracy, in the interim space-time between alterity and counting, between the counted and the uncountable, we locate both friendship and democracy-to-come as a certain politics of touch. When friendship becomes a question of touch, a question of a politics of touch, we can situate friendship as that which must function in the “to-come,” in the “perhaps,” in Lai-Yu Fai’s “we’ll see” or in Po-Wing’s “let’s start over.” But the perhaps is not all there is to friendship, nor is the perhaps, as such, enough for politics. What is also necessary is touch, a movement of desire toward an other, a re-engagement with sensing bodies in movement. This is why Fai’s “we’ll see” and Po-Wing’s “let’s start over” lead neither to a continued desire nor to a politics of friendship. It is not enough to want to return to the same. We must be willing to return to the not-yet-invented. Touch in its unpredictability and reciprocity—a rigorous politics of the unknowable—is necessary. Otherwise, both the “let’s start over” and the “we’ll see” are statements of elision, of lack of courage in speaking honestly about a future that is not to come, as is the case between Po-Wing and Lai-Yu Fai.
