It is necessary for sense to be reconsidered not in its dichotomous role vis-à-vis signiﬁcation, but according to a whole new series of paradoxes, experiments, and events, toward a thinking of the incorporeal. Democracy, if thought along these lines, becomes a re-thinking of the manner in which sensing creates new ways of engaging space and time according to reﬂexes not based on learned reactions to stimuli (the most current understanding of the senses) but according to a different conception of a body. If we understand sensing as more than a motor response, we are in a position to explore the unknowability of sense. In other words, sensing need not express a sensation we have already experienced. To sense may also be to know differently, in excess of my current appreciation of “my” body. It is in this regard that sensing can be considered a prosthetic to the biological body. To sense may be to create a new body. If new bodies are what is at stake, new politics will have to be created. A democracy-to-come cannot know in advance what or where or who the body is. Democracy as a sensing politics is a movement toward making sense(s), towards new orientations of experience. Sense does not pre-exist experience. Within a politics of touch, I am unable to state the sense, to locate at one and the same time something and its meaning. Sense resists essence: sense(s) cannot be signiﬁed.
