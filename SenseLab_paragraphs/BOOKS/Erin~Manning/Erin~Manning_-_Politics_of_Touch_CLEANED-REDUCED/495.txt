The pact projects onto politics the internal contradictions of institutions, of bodies, while at the same time expressing the passional conﬂicts of the multitude. Through the pact, politics manifests itself. “Institutions by themselves have no other power than that of the masses, including when it is a matter of a power of decomposition” (Balibar in Montag and Stolze 1997, 185). This is a multiway process: it is most often through institutions that the masses organize themselves into tendencies, into lines of ﬂight that in turn destabilize or destroy the very institution through which power was instantiated. Institutions breed their own demise, as do individuals. Democracy is not only the potential to work together to form institutional bonds. It is also the potential of destratifying the body of the state to build war machines that project onto the institution the destabilizing forces of unpredictable and ungainly Bodies without Organs. Revolutions are internal to the system. Revolutions in the name of a politics of touch are about moving the matter and mattering the movement. A politics of touch demands of the Body without Organs that it leave its trace, that it incorporealize the organs of its passing.
