What is often left unwritten in renditions of the body (-politic) is the notion of antagonism on which the body rests. This antagonism is a mechanism of the reproduction and transformation of subjectivity that produces both effect and affect, troubling the political rationalities sustained within the imaginary of the nation-state. Within this matrix of antagonism versus victimization, political enactment stands out as the intersection between local histories mapped onto the template of the body and bodily spaces that challenge the very writing of history (on the body). The multiple subject positions factored by political agency within the vocabulary of state-sovereignty are versions not of a metamorphosing body, but faces of the state. The body is thus rendered redundant. But the body always appeals this
redundancy, for the senses that give movement to the body are never still enough to allow the body to fully become stabilized within a state-centered chronotope. The uniÔ¨Åed subject shifts between transactional and transnational spaces as well as from linguistic discursivity to somatic dissonance: If social space and body space continually predicate each other and if both are subjected to an ongoing reconstruction by violence, the notion of a stable relationship of agency to nomothetic social frames, such as class, ethnicity, or political ideology, becomes problematic.
