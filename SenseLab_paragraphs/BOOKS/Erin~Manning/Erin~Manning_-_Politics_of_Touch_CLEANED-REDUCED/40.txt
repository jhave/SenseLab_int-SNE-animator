Technicity interlaces geographic, ecological, energetic, economic, and historical dimensions without being reducible to any of them. Technicity opens the way for a thinking of the consequences of ethology, a concept that emerges in chapter 6. Ethology is an ecological ethics, an ethics that takes into account the process of worlding. Worlding opens the way for a becoming-machinic of the world where I am no longer a passive receiver and you an active giver. Becoming-machinic is not something that happens to the world. Worlding is immanently machinic in the same way that my BwO is always more than its-self. “I” cannot conceive of moving. What moves is the technicity of the body: senses, extensions, matter/form. When I reach out to touch you, I extend the space I have created between me and you. This extension carries my sense perception (my almost-touch) and can therefore also be considered as prosthetic to my “organic” matter-form. Becoming-machinic is another way of expressing the immanence of Bodies without Organs incessantly creating themselves, for better or for worse.
