According to Nietzsche, there is no difference between the body as a political structure and the political structure as the body (1968, 492). The body is the fractured product of the differential effects of intersecting antagonistic forces. As Deleuze writes, informed by Nietzsche’s comments on the body: “Whether chemical, biological, social or political... any two forces being unequal constitute a body as soon as they enter into a relation” (1977, 80–81). The body assumes not one form but as many forms as there are powers orienting it. “The intersection of forces (political practices) cohere into an economy of the body. The body is a cumulative effect of exchanges between agonistic forces” (Feldman 1991, 177). The body is not simply that which conforms to the state’s grids of intelligibity onto which its politics of interiority and exteriority are transcribed. The body is a point of transaction, of transculture, of disagreement.
