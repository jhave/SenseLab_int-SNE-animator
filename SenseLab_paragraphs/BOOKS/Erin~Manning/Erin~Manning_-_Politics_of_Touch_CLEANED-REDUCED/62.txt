Potentiality, as the insertion of difference in a moment of certainty, is one way of speaking of the divergence between normativity and the interruption of accepted norms. I read potentiality as that which exposes difference in systems that appear to be organized and unchanging. I do not seek to place actuality and potentiality in opposition, however. The passage from potentiality to actuality need not be ascertained as an elimination of potential. Rather, this passage can be theorized as potentiality itself, for potentiality resides within every interaction: potentiality is called forth every time language exceeds its syntax, every time an other exceeds my reach, every time I sense more than I comprehend.
