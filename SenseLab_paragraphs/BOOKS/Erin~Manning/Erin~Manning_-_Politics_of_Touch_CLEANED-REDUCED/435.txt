Good sense is said of one direction only. This direction (consensual nationstate “democratic” politics, for instance) is determined as that which goes from the most to the least differentiated. Time moves in only one direction when space is static. Good sense fulﬁlls its mandate by holding the body to the grid. Holding the body from movement is to afﬁrm only a single direction, a single pace, allowing the body to differentiate itself only from the singular to the regular, and from the remarkable to the ordinary. What makes bodies interesting is that they regularly resist this grid, re-de-forming themselves (in movement) all the while, even if only at a cellular level. So the real danger is not that the body will be kept still, but that a politics will be written onto the body that resists engaging with the movement that is intrinsic to the relations between bodies and worlds. Such a politics, which naturalizes the shift from the extraordinary to the ordinary through a rendering-static of potential, is not a democratic politics, but a sedentary distribution of affects along a lifeless grid.
