In Blake, the senses are not limited to speciﬁc organs. The senses are relational. The senses traverse space unrestricted, forever growing to encompass the expansive limits of an extended body. The more majestic the body, the larger the senses and the wider their capacities. Senses move the body beyond itself, inciting it to become more than its organs, calling forth a Body without Organs.19 “A vast Spine writh’d in torment / Upon the winds’” (9:37–38). This reference to Urizen’s body signals an intensiﬁed movement through space, more and less than the sum of its senses. “Though all... parts, belong to the same body, some are insigniﬁcant in the relation to the landscape, and some proportionately large” (Connolly 2002b, 89). A sense of exposure is tangible in Urizen’s description—veins, nerves, inner organs, and ﬁbers are exposed to the vastness: “Urizen is one with his environment as a cosmic man: there is no skin to make a border between himself and his world” (Connolly 2002b, 90).
