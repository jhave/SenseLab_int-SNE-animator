Margulis deﬁnes symbiogenesis as “an evolutionary change by the inheritance of acquired gene sets” (1998, 9) wherein living beings defy neat deﬁnition. The symbiotic world individuates violently, passionately, indifferently, ﬁghting, feeding, mating, dancing, dying. Generating novelty, symbiogenesis brings together different life forms through matings that are often incorporations. This is not a one-to-one procedure whereby individuals can be delineated within an economically stable system. This process is metastable. Fixed individuality is a concept that cannot exist within a symbiosis that causes complex alterations in the form-matter relation. Symbiogenesis brings together life forms that are “even more unlike than their ‘unlike’ parents” (Margulis 1998, 9). These individuations become larger, more complex unities. Individuations become compositions that become populations that become multi-unit symbiotic systems.
