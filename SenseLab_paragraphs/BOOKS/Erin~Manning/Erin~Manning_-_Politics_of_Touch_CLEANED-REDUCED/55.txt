“Politics,” writes Agamben, “is the sphere of pure means, that is, of the absolute and complete gesturality of human beings” (2000, 59). I want to suggest that tango, a transcultural movement of desire, can be envisioned as a political gesture toward an other. Tango is an exile into the unknowable world of bodies. “The history of the tango is a story of encounters between those who should never have met or between those who, having met, will remain forever disencountered” (Savigliano 1995, xv). This political moment of (dis)encounter is initiated through an embrace that rarely lasts beyond the duration of the tango itself. This encounter, relentless and short-lived, proposes a violation of critical distances, inviting at once intimacy, tension, and conﬂict.
