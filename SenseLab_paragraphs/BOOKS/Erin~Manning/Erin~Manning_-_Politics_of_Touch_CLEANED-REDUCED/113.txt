A politics of friendship is an unfolding of the space of the crossing, of the gaps between the positions of the grid. Such a politics senses an other, touches an other, rather than simply locating (and imprisoning) an other within its grids of intelligibility. This is not an encounter ﬁrst mediated by linguistic signiﬁcance: there is no “signiﬁcation” which precedes sensation. This is a sensed encounter, an encounter experienced through the body, where it is the body that calls forth the politics and not vice versa. “When a body is in motion,” writes Massumi, “it does not coincide with itself. It coincides with its own transition: its own variation.... In motion, a body is an immediate, unfolding relation to its own nonpresent potential to vary” (2002a, 4). Bodies in movement always reach toward one another, hence the dream of “starting over.” Touch is always a process we must begin anew. One of the richnesses of Wong Kar Wai’s Happy Together is the lack of simpliﬁcation in relating this friendship and love affair between the two men, both of whom ﬁnd themselves caught between the need to re-create themselves and the temptation to believe in the lamp’s story of make-believe.
