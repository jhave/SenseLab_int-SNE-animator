In a model of consensual politics, the citizen cannot have an unstable body, for that body would challenge the organization of the body-politic. Any unstable body is always eventually disqualiﬁed from state politics. The other, the outside, the homeless, the refugee or the stranger, the sexual “deviant,” none of these bodies “exists” within the realm of social consensus. How could they? These are bodies that err from the grids of intelligibility of state politics, these are bodies that resist the national imaginary, bodies without citizenship, without passports, without legitimacy. They are, as Rancière writes, the uncounted, the uncountable. The ultimate violence of the state is precisely this: to allege that it does not err. In its desperate attempts to maintain the coherence of its grids of intelligibility, the state’s body-politic attempts to erase all forms of power/knowledge that might alert us to the porosity of its consensual apparatus. The body, every body, and most certainly the “nonexistent” body at the borders of the state, threatens the state’s strict dichotomy between inside and outside. These deviant bodies emphasize the porosity of their mobile, sensing ﬂeshiness. Violence (of the state, against the state) makes the performance of this encounter visible, registering differences in kind.
