Beardsworth writes:
The impossible aporia of law releases the possibility of possibility. This impossible possibility constitutes the measure by which all judgments can only fail to measure themselves. Hence the measure of judgment is nothing but the impossibility of its measure; in this impossibility the singular arrives. (1996, 44)
