Back to prosthetics: how to think the body as always already prosthetic? I am an organism. I breathe, my heart beats, my pancreas controls the sugar levels in my blood, my skin regenerates, my liver cleans my blood, my kidneys ﬁlter wastes and expel them, my brain receives and disseminates waves of information. But I am also much more than an organism. I breathe a smell that tastes like the morning. The morning reminds me of the texture of the wood of the breakfast table, rough to the touch at the spot where the detergent ate through the varnish. To “be” a body is to become. To sense is to live in the beyond of the mere organism. Sensing is not essential to the organic body. I smell in excess of the strict composition of my ﬂesh and bones. But without my senses I am not aware of my ﬂesh as “body.” It is in this regard that senses are prosthetic: they are in excess of the organic, yet they make the organic palpable.
