Derrida asks: “Can [critiques of violence] do justice without doing justice to this justice?” (1978, 147). The violence of the concept is what it at stake here. A politics of touch is violent in its very articulation. It is violent because it tears the fabric of state politics in order to ask about the relation between touch and violence. It is violent because it raises questions about how erring toward experience must lead toward the unknowable. Touch is not impervious to an economy of violence. Entering an economy of violence is to engage the relation between touch and untouchability, between touch as reaching and touch as an erring that never quite succeeds in ﬁnalizing its approach toward an other. Touch is a threat even while it creates an opening. Touch threatens as it marks the inevitability of its untouchability: I touch you as the one who will always, in some sense, remain untouchable. Your untouchability exists in an economy of violence from which I cannot safely emerge as long as we are in relation. Yet, in relation, we also create worlds through which we redeﬁne violence.
