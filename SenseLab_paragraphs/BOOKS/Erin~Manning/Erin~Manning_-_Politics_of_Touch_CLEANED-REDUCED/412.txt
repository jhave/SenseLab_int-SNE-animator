Spacing, for Nancy, is at the heart of the concept of liberty: freedom is the discrete play of the interval, offering the space of play wherein the “each time” takes place: the possibility of an irreducible singularity occuring . . . that is already free in the sense that it occurs in the free space and spacing of time where the singular one time is only possible. Freedom is that which spaces and singularizes... Freedom... throws the subject into the space of the sharing of being. Freedom is the speciﬁc logic of the access to  the self outside of itself in a spacing, each time singular, of being.... “Spacing space” would mean keeping it as space and as the sharing of being, in order indeﬁnitely to share the sharing of singularities.
