In Buenos Aires, Fai takes a job as a doorman at a tango bar. While he works on the outskirts of the tango, Po-Wing plays on the inside, partaking of the multiple and contradictory strands of desire inside the tango bar. The tango, in Happy Together, is a local space of contradiction, at once a tourist trap (for busloads of Asians) and a local nightclub. It is a place to dance, to love, to ﬁght, to desire, to be friends, a place at once startlingly heterosexual and calmly homosexual after hours. The tango bar featured in Happy Together — El Sur —is the nemesis of the Iguazu Falls as much as their reﬂection: tango functions both as the signiﬁer of exoticism and of a transcultural movement of desire. Through an engagement with tango, Happy Together negotiates the complex webs of transnationalism. Tango is at once pictured as the exotic dance that travels so successfully from Buenos Aires to Asia and back, and as the dance that will always remain resolutely Argentinean. This paradox of tango—with Fai waiting outside and Po-Wing participating inside—is rendered in all of its complexity, leaving us not with a simple image of tango’s Argentine-ness but with the recognition that we must con- tinually be aware that our improvisations will invariably lead us to spaces we cannot yet envisage.
