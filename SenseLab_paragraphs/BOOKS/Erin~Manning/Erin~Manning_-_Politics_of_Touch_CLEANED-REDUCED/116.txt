This moving-toward friendship is not an abstract concept. It is in and of the body, it is a movement toward sensing an other, a movement where I reach out to touch you, acknowledging the implicit violence in my act of crossing time and space, an act that can never be present in position, but only in passing, an engagement of our bodies in their indeterminacy. This does not always imply a touching (indeed, touch would be more present in “love” than in most “friendships”) but it does involve the possibility of touching an other in the here and now. Such a reaching-toward can only be considered a politics (in the proper sense of politics, that is, politics as an encounter with the unknowable) when it is carried out in an indeterminacy that is inseparable from the bodies in motion. I can only touch you in friendship when I allow my body to create a space-time for that friendship by moving indeterminately toward you. In friendship, my body is in passage. With your body, I accept the paradox of the body’s incorporeal dimension: I acknowledge our bodies as sensations of movement, as touch, as the “points of indistinction between violence and the law” (Agamben 1998, 32). “Real, material, but incorporeal. Inseparable, coincident, but disjunct” (Massumi 2002a, 5).
