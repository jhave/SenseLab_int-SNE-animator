“We cannot... know individuation, we can only individuate, individuate ourselves, individuate in ourselves” (Simondon 1995, 34). Individuations are not composed of identities. To engender is not to attach an identity to a body. “[O]nly a theory that thinks being through the operations of multiplicity of his or her individuation is in a position to transform an approach to the relation in order to understand it as ‘a relation in being, a way of being’ ” (Combes 1999, 33). Relation does not convey a separation between, for example, engendering and gender, but is borne in the emergence of gender within engendering, constituting the terms themselves as relational. Being is becoming-relational.
