As night falls, we meet in bars always difﬁcult to locate. We change our shoes, we glance around the room to ﬁnd a human connection, and we dance. These evenings that are often drawn out into the early morning are about an exchange of movement and touch, about a transnational negotiation of desire, of gender roles and communication. In New York, Berlin, Buenos Aires, Montreal, Honolulu, Brussels, Nijmegen, tango asserts its language of desire, its politics of touch.
Tango, a signiﬁer of darkness and illegitimacy, of desire and counter-culture, is more than a dance. As Horacio Ferrer writes, “before being an artistic expression, before tango came to light as such... tango was a certain attitude, a way of life adopted by those of diverse cultures” (1995, 11). In its popular representations, Argentine tango is described as a dance that evokes illicit sexual desire through an acrobatics that often looks choreographed. But Argentine tango is much more than this mythic evocation of a movement of desire. Tango is everything from a dance of solitudes to a nomadic move- ment of cultural displacement to a ﬁerce locator of national identity. It is a dance of encounter and disencounter, a voyeuristic embrace of repressed sensuality and a complex network of (mis)understood directions.
Like all social tangos, the tango I explore here is improvised. Indeed, it is the improvised nature of tango that fascinates me and makes it possible for me to advance tango as an example of a politics of touch. Since the movements of tango are always to come, it is impossible to speak of “a” tango, of an ideal gesture or a “contained” politics. Rather, tango operates through- out as an invested attempt to explore relation in the context of a potential politics-to-come.
