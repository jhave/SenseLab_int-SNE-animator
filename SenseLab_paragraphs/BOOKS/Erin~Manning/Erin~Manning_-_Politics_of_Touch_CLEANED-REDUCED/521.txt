The BwO is posthuman to the extent that in its deterritorializations it persistently rebels against the humanism that holds bodies to their organisms. Posthumanity gives us a vocabulary to think through prosthetics in relation to the senses. In a humanist vocabulary of the organism, to conceive of the senses as prosthetic is an unseemly endeavor. Bodies are more likely to be thought of as uniÔ¨Åed and unique. The posthuman, on the other hand, takes the prosthesis as a condition of the organism, as its supplement. The human does not become prosthetic.
