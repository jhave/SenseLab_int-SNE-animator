If the state is essentially both natural and plural as Aristotle suggests, the important question is how this relation of the natural and the plural is theorized as a central component of his understanding of the state-system. Plurality is evoked here as a multitude of identifying practices that depart from a common ground: man. Man, for Aristotle, is natural (i.e., political) and therefore plural, whereas woman is not political, nor, by extension, plural. Plurality in the polis implies a system that supports the organization of a naturalization of the terms at stake (politics, gender, race) by like-minded men. This is not substantially different from state-systems today where a chorus of like-minded voices are united to pledge allegiance to the citizen-nation- state triad. Space and time are withheld within this system as markers for a stable geography (even in the international or “global” realm) and a consis- tent history. Plurality (in the name of most multiculturalisms) conforms to the dimensions of difference controlled and sustained within state sovereignty. Politics of touch attempt to evoke a pluralism that radically departs from Aristotelian thought and celebrates a demystiﬁcation of the naturalizations that allow ends to become means. Through a notion of politics that is pro- duced as a means without an end, a potentiality rather than an actuality, we can begin to defy the constriction of time and space straitjacketed by the nation-state.
