Bodies without Organs emerge in potentia of a politics of touch. Touch is of the body but not strictly on the body. It is an intensity at work in the creation and dissemination of a BwO. It is a vector of emergence and reception that plays on the intensities at work in the BwO. It latches onto your intensity, adhering to it only long enough to express the moment of passage. To touch is to make a pact. Touch is a mode composed of many parts. It is a mode that is capable of being affected while affecting. Parts are affected by pacts which are, themselves, remnants of pacts. The body is part of a pact that involves touch, touch is part of a pact that involves politics, politics is part of a pact that involves the body. The nature of these extensive parts is that they affect one another ad inﬁnitum. A mode has affections by virtue of its capacity to be affected. It is in this sense that the mode—touch, a politics of touch—is a Body without Organs.
