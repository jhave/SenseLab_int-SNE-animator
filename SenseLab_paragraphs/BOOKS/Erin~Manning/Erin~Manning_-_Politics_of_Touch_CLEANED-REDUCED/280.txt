I place touch at the fore to prevent myself from falling into the trap of ﬁxing bodies as simple objects of thought. As Butler writes in another context, “this moving beyond their own boundaries, a movement of boundary itself, [is] quite central to what bodies ‘are’” (1993, ix). Gender is only part of what differentiates bodies, and cultural determinism does have a tendency to be the main tool in helping us understand the constitutive status of these differentiations. What Butler does in Bodies That Matter is place construction as the constitutive element of the performativity of gendered bodies.
