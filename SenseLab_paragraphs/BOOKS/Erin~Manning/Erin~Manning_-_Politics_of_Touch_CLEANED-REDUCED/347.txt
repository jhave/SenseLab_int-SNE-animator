There are no pre-established criteria that would favor the passage from engendering to gendering. If gender is not conceived as a naturalized biological essence or strictly a sociocultural condition of possibility, we can conceive of a politics of gender as an engendering toward a composition and decomposition of bodies engaging in the activity of forces and energies that are neither solely biological nor solely political. “A body is deﬁned by metastable relations between microcellular and multicellular bodies, the bodies of animals and humans, the bodies of society and technological bodies merging and unleashing new mutating compositions” (Parisi 2004, 27). En-genderings that gender are not exhausted by their classiﬁcations. Rather, they are connected to an intensive body that is inventive. This transformation exceeds a simple shift in discourse. The en-gendered body is an affective, relational body that not only individuates in excess of its-self, but creates new and differing chronotopes that qualitatively alter the matterform of which it is composed. What emerges is “a map of the non-linear movements of connection between causes and effects unfolding the potential (force) of a body to mutate through an ecosystem of indeﬁnite mixtures” (Parisi 2004, 29).
