transnational implications where tango is concerned, insisting instead that tango is the unique reference of the symbolic identity and territory of Argentine culture.
Despite these echoes toward a politics of Argentine national identity, I maintain that tango involves a transculturation, a state of becoming through alterity. Tango is a movement through politics that both reinforces the status quo of the politics of national identity and transgresses these very politics. This play between transgression and cohesion takes place in the weaving of tango’s complex webs, webs entwined around tango’s implicit desire to communicate, through the body, with an other. A dance that must be re-encountered with every new dancer, tango appeals to the senses. It does so through microperceptual movements initiated through improvisation and spontaneity that require an adequate response yet suggest, always, the possibility of subverting the expected.
