Fixed genders and sexually maintained species only began evolving about a billion years ago. Meiotic sex evolved in those protoctists that had already evolved by bacterial sex (both transgenically and symbiotically). “Neither plant nor animal appeared on Earth until bacteria had undergone at least 2000 million years of chemical and social evolution” (Margulis 1998, 56). All life has direct ancestry among bacteria: we are massive colonies of micro-organisms. Human bodies are open, growing systems. Our boundaries are continually changing.
