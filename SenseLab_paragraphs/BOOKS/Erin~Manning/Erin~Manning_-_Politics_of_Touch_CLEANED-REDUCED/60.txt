For Aristotle, a good life involves social relations and institutions: man is a creature by nature adapted for life in a polis. The purpose of the state is to do what the individual man cannot: the state is put into place in order to extend beyond “mere” life. In this scenario, the state is synonymous with political partnership, a partnership established by nature to satisfy all the daily needs of the household (1961, 383). This partnership established by nature is considered “natural,” which supports Aristotle’s claim that “man is by nature an animal designed for living in states” (1961, 384). Aristotle argues that the state of which he speaks is a plurality that exists for the sake of the citizen prior both to the individual human being and to the house- hold, for “the whole must be prior to the part”: the state is a political organization of a like-minded plurality (1961, 384). Within this system, the citizen is not a citizen simply by virtue of inhabiting a certain place of residence, the citizen is he who has a share in the administration of justice in holding political ofﬁce: “[t]he goodness of a reputable citizen is thought to consist of the right use of ruling and being ruled” (1961, 408).
