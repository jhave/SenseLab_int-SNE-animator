Yet, in many ways, the sensing body is anathema to the national bodypolitic, to its politics of consensus, to its violent politics of exclusion. “I am   the continuous, necessary overcoming of myself,” writes Nietzsche, “. . . nothing but struggle and becoming and purpose and contradiction of purposes” (1969, 3:271). We are our body, and we are the spaces we create and embody as we reach-toward. We are the embodiment of homesickness that attests to the fact that ultimate stability (consensus) is impossible. To live, we touch, or conversely, to stop touching is to die, to deprive ourselves of a body. Tactility is fraught with an ambiguity we cannot resolve. This ambiguity, this complex worlding, is perhaps the most difﬁcult thing to sustain over time. This is the founding paradox of the national body-politic.
