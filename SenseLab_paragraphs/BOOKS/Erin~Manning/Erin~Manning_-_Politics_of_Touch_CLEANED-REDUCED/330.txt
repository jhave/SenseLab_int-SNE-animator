In its incarnations as a dance that crosses the boundaries between gender (and it is important to add here that this is still a rare occurrence18), I experience in tango a continual shift between the corporeal and the incorporeal that allows my body to matter differently. In touch, the movement in relation calls forth the virtuality—the incorporeality—of my body. As we move, we space time, engendering what is not yet. Our dance virtually takes place through the openness to a touch-in-movement. Movement in the dance becomes the way I reach toward the potentiality of spacing time and timing space, challenging the boundaries of multiplicities-in-relation. I am no longer simply leading: I am reaching toward a space I will create with you. This spacing occurs in tandem with you who make the choice to engage that space, to respond to the space by entering into it, by inviting me to follow. Your body thus becomes an extension of my movement, an extension not of my self but of its improvisatory nature, an extension of our capacity to enter into relation.
