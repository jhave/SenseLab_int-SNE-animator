Through tango, we have a gripping story of the seductions of imperialism. In order for the dance to be appropriated, it had to become less the dance of touch, and more the choreographed dance of exotic associations with difference (difference understood here as the stable dichotomous presen- tation of the self-same). A focus on touch and its unpredictable reachings- toward would have been difﬁcult to appropriate and exoticize without endangering the position of the usurper. Hence, what is generally empha- sized in the story of tango is the eroticization of two bodies moving together rather than the improvisational touch necessary to this movement. The story of tango thus becomes halted within images more like that of Fai being taught his “follower’s” steps, than the ﬁnal image of Happy Together where Po-Wing dances with the man in the tango bar, continuously exchanging the roles of leader and follower.
