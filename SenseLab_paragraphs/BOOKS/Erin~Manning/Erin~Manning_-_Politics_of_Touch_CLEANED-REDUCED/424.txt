Deleuze writes:
The I is primary and sufﬁcient in the order of speech only insofar as it envelops signiﬁcations which must be developed for themselves in the order of language (langue). If these signiﬁcations collapse, or are not established
in themselves, personal identity is lost... in conditions where god, the world and the self become blurred characters of the dream of someone who is poorly determined. This is why the last recourse seems to be identifying  sense with signiﬁcation. (1990b, 18)
