and the love that grows and gets crushed between their two impatient bodies. “Seeing Ho Po-Wing again,” says Lai-Yu Fai in voice-over, “I didn’t want to ‘start over’ but return to Hong Kong.” Staged as a situation of either-or, Happy Together places the friendship and love affair between Po-Wing and Lai-Yu Fai as an impediment to a return to the homeland. And indeed it is, if we consider the “homeland” as a place one could return to, unscathed, with the “home” always nostalgically unaltered. Buenos Aires here operates not as the “other” homeland, or even an other home, but as the constant reminder that “home” cannot be reached in any deﬁnitive sense. Worlds are intermixed, as in tango, lacking any deﬁnite points of departure we might want to call origins. Our bodies move, and in so doing, we create temporary places we can call home, but there can be no ultimate return that does not do violence to the multiplicities created in and through our bodies-in-motion. This is not a question of decision-making, but a question of emergence, for until we recognize that all homes are of our own making, we cannot decide to return there. We must recognize the emergent qualities of our bodies in motion to understand the ways in which we manufacture the homes of our dreams and our nightmares.
