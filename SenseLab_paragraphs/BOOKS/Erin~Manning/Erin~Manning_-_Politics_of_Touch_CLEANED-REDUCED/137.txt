The next time Lai-Yu Fai and Po-Wing meet, it is in a state of physical need. Po-Wing arrives at Fai’s apartment bloody from a ﬁght. Fai takes him to the hospital and then brings him home where he takes care of him. During this period of their relationship (“Some things I never told Ho Po-Wing,” relates Fai in a later voice-over, “I didn’t want him to recover too fast. Those were our happiest times together”), Po-Wing depends on Lai-Yu Fai in a different sense, and I believe it is this hierarchy of care that most puts into jeopardy their love and friendship. For, as Fai later admits, he relished this period of Po-Wing’s dependence, and where there is dependence there are hierarchical nets of power that lead in the direction of a state-governed understanding of politics rather than towards a politics of friendship. There is no touch in this kind of care, not if care becomes entirely dependent on need. Care, a certain Mitsorge in the Heideggerian sense, must remain reciprocal, even in periods of greatest need, if desire and friendship are to be created. But, as these scenes in the ﬁlm poignantly demonstrate, it is tempting, always, to engage in a relationship of dependence, particularly in an era in which the vocabularies of reciprocity with which we are most familiar are based on parameters of hierarchical positioning. We are given the tools, in a society of fraternity, to understand friendship within the terms of charity, not as a multiplicitous movement of desire that invents new bonds.
