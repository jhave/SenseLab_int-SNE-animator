In the chapters that follow, I have not attempted to develop a coherent politics (this would reinstate a linear space-time), but have instead sought to create lines of ﬂight that invite us to rethink the ways in which movement alters many of those concepts we consider foundational. To think bodies in movement is to rethink the relation between space and time, between move- ment and stillness, between a politics of the nation-state and the Spinozean pact. It is to inquire into democracies-to-come and to wonder what poli- tics might become were we capable of reinventing it. To think bodies in movement is to ask how knowledges/worlds are created, and whether these worlds are capable of expanding the “simple location”3 of organic bodies. To explore touch in these ways is to be willing to engage with the body as excessive to the national body-politic, to express an interest in a body that is always more expansive than we have heretofore been able to imagine.
