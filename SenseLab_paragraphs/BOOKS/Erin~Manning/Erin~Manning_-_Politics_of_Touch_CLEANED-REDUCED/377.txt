The law is written on porous skin. The law itself is aporetic. “The future anterior of determinant law is the law of the force of all law” (Beardsworth 1996, 100). The aporetic quality of time and law mark the delay of human invention. The justiﬁcation of law is what makes time stand still, turning politics into policy.
