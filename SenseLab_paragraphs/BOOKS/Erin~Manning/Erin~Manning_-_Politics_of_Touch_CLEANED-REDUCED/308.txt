If codings are inseparable from intrinsic and extrinsic processes of decoding (through supplementation and “side-communication”), and if territorialities are equally involved in these processes, then the key insight is that it is populations that are the “subject” of these mutually implicated processes of coding, decoding, and deterritorialization. On this model “evolution” does not simply entail the passage from one pre-established form of life to another, involving only the translation of one code into another. Rather,  there are the phenomena of mutations, genetic drift, and the transferal of cells of one species to another that takes place not in terms of “translation” but rather in terms of a surplus value of code (“side-communication”).
