Reaching out beyond the limit blurs the boundary between law-preserving and law-instituting violence. Law has an interest in a monopoly of violence. The violence it unleashes threatens to lead to its demise and must therefore be kept well concealed within the nation’s practices of securing: every system of law and order is predicated and maintained by a violence that could dissolve it. The state asserts that to be safe (free of violence), we must consent to state governmental practices. “Violence exists at the core of Constitutional power to the State (in the name of the People) to practice violence over the people, while the ofﬁce of the judge includes a fully sanctioned and absolved ‘homicidal quality’” (Gourgouris 1996, 132). As Robert Cover suggests, state violence is not explicitly stated in these cases because violence is written into the very idea of government (in Gourgouris 1996, 132).
