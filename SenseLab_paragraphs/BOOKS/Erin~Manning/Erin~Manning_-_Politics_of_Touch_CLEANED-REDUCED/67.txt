As a movement reaching toward, a gesture evokes an instance in which nothing is absolutely maintained. A gesture explores the medium—be it the movement, the touch, the word — as a means not of transforming potentiality into actuality, but as a way of eclipsing actuality by placing the emphasis on the movement itself, on the exchange. As Agamben writes, gesture “allows the emergence of the being-in-a-medium of human beings and thus it opens the ethical dimension for them” (2000, 58).
A gesture interrupts language in the moments when language attempts to convert itself to actuality. Challenging the notion that being-in-language can be said as such, a gesture draws our attention to the challenges within expression, leading us to the ephemeral realm of the unsayability of words as completed thoughts. In this way, a gesture acts as a force that renders palpable language’s instability, challenging language to become an infralanguge of interrelation, where the felt is said even as the said is felt. Gesture re-inforces the fact that communication is not linear, that language cannot be concretely symbolized, that the words that “reach” an other cannot be completely comprehended. Certainly, language and/as gesture can organize a certain version of a polis, but it does so more in the disorganization of like-minded people than by encouraging conformity.
