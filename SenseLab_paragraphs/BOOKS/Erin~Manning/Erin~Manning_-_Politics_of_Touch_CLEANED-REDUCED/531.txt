The state needs the body. Hence my injunction to take sovereignty seriously as well as the politics of security sovereignty engenders. At the same time, we would do well to follow the Spinozean route at least as far as to remember that there is no essential dichotomy between states and Nature. Bodies coexist as they correlate. State bodies are not fundamentally different from other kinds of bodies. The difference is that the body the state historically represents, as Nietzsche points out, is a body that agrees to or is incited to be governed in particular ways. In Hobbes, the sovereign embodies an exchange between freedom and security that combines the individual and sovereign subjects (the state and the citizen) into a single Ô¨Ågure. The Hobbesean citizen becomes the rational modern subject who is represented as anything but a sensing body in movement. There is such a stagnancy in the concept of the modern subject as to suggest that the sovereign body is a still-life in the imaginary representation of the territorial nation-state.
