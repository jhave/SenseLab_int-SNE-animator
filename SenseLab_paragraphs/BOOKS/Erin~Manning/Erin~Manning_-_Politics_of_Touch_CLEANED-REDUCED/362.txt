We pay attention to the surface. We are mesmerized by it, by its mutations, its impenetrability. Body art is simply an obvious example: “Body art represents...a sustained effort to reverse the dematerialization of art by making the body matter” (Taylor 1997, 111). Most body art encourages us to forget, for an instant, that we are piercing our organs.2 Facing the “outside,” we place our skins between us and the world. If we consider our bodies as whole, we imagine our skins as protective (prosthetic). Strange connection, then, between bodies without organs and skins.
Skins do not need “external” markings to express their mutability. Skins are mutations, continuously altering the limits of our engagements with the world: hot, cold, open, scarred, contained, exposed. Any sense of security we might have invested into the concept of skin and its ability to protect us from the outside is cast into doubt when we recognize that skin is but one of the ephemeral signs of the ultimate asigniﬁcability of the border. Bodies are not foreclosed by limits. Bodies extend, expressively, creating skinscapes that are as complex as the landscapes that make up our political vistas.
