An object is in equilibrium when the forces acting on it are such that there is no tendency for the object to move. We know that bodies move. Therefore it is not conceivable that they are (always) in equilibrium. Bodies as machines are often far from equilibrium: changes in the surrounding environment cause changes in the system. Far-from-equilibrium systems are metastable, marked by an element of unpredictability, by a capacity for development, for individuation and mutation. Mutation refers as much to the way systems are organized, composed, and articulated as to divergences in those systems. Mutants are bodies by another name.
