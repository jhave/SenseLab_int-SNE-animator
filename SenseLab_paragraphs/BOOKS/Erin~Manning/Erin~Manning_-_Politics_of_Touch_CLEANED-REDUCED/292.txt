Individuation begins at the cellular level: “bacteria are not really individuals so much as part of a single global superorganism, responding to changed environmental conditions not by speciating but by excreting and incorporating useful genes from their well-endowed neighbours and then rampantly multiplying” (Margulis and Sagan 1997, 55). Within the Darwinian and neo-Darwinian frameworks, individual differences are at the core of natural selection. Lynn Margulis disputes this claim, suggesting that rather than the individual, symbiosis is at the heart of evolution. Symbiosis as deﬁned by Margulis suggests a process of individuation. Individuation produces individuation, not individuals. To think of evolution as a process of engendering is to begin to challenge the Darwinian and neo-Darwinian evolutionary canon that continues to privilege individuals over individuations, genders over engenderings, stable and inert matter and form over composite exfoliating multiplicities.
