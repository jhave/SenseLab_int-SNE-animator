Contact challenges me to a decision to be-with either tact-fully  or toward touch. This is a decision I will always make anew. If I decide not to touch toward the untouchable, I will continue to operate within a version of politics that has already been secured as a measure of the current political situation.1 To engage in a politics of touch is to respond beyond the judgment tact activates. A politics of touch will always embody tact as its nemesis (and vice versa). Tact will warn touch in its hoarse whisper about the risks at hand, attempting to put the senses in their place, even as I continue to reach toward the untouchability of the senses as senses, asking of my body that it expand, prosthetically, toward a concept of the senses that signiﬁes not the biological body but the body’s imminent excess.
