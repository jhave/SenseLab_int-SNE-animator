As Parisi emphasizes in Abstract Sex, individuations do not create unities such as “woman” or “man.” Rather, individuations are complex already at the cellular level and challenge the hierarchies between bacterial and human sexual practices that seek to relegate gendered vocabularies within capitalist narratives of surplus value and territorial vocabularies of binding identity practices. Endosymbiosis emphasizes that the regulation of bodies cannot be a one-sided operation. Any reaching toward is a crossing of a malleable border from gender to gender, from gender to en-gendering, engendering to engenderings. Bodies can be regulated, certainly, but bodies relate always beyond or in spite of these regulations, reciprocally, and this is their politics, a politics of touch that operates always, in some sense, in excess of the national body-politic.
