Deleuze’s notion of the movement-image is one way of thinking the wholeness of movement in conjunction with the becoming-molecular of matter. When movement is conceived as transmutational, it is no longer derivative. A movement-image is no longer the image “of ” something else. Movement no longer foregrounds a part-object—it transmutes the image. Movement as image reveals force not as a discrete element of form but as its operational envelope. Holding force in abeyance, the image foregrounds its experiential nature. This experiential wholeness of movement moving-with and moving-within the image is always at once actual and virtual. It is actual when it is prehended. Otherwise it remains virtual, backgrounded in the imperceptible wholeness of its infinitude. All of movement can never be prehended: prehension is a pulling out of portions of duration—events—out of which a nexus of experience is composed. This nexus is not an “out-there” that predates the event. The event is the movement of the image, its withness of movement moving. Wholeness of movement upsets the linearity of time: planes coexist and intersect.
