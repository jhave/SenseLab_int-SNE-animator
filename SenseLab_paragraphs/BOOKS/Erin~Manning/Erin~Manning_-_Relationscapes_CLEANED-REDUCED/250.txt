Contrast in Whitehead does not mean the equal juxtaposition of two extremes. It is “that particularity of conjoint unity which arises from the realized togetherness of eternal objects” (Whitehead 1929/1978, 229). Contrast is the activity of foregrounding or backgrounding that makes certain qualities stand out, creating what Whitehead calls emergent evolutions.
