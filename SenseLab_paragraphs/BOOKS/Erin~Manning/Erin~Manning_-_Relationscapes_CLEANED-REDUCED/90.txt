Creating a movement is initiating a dance. This dance demands grace, a grace that is not a succumbing to an outside, but a feeling of the inside, inside-out. “Grace is like the paradigm of intensity that escapes all quantitative reduction of movement” (Bergson 1959/1970, 12–13). Grace is never felt solely through a step. Grace is the becoming-dance of the step, when walking flows in the between of directions where holes become emergent openings rather than missed opportunities.
