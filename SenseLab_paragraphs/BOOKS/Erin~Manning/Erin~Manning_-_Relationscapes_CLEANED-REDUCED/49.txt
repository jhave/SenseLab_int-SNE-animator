The displacement is not the event. The event is the composition of space-time that qualitatively alters the topological dimensions of our sensing bodies in movement. In Bergson’s words: “We attribute to the motion the divisibility of the space which it traverses, forgetting that it is quite possible to divide an object, but not an act: and on the other hand we accustom ourselves to projecting this act itself into space, to applying it to the whole of the line which the moving body traverses, in a word, to solidifying” (2002, 65). In preacceleration there is never simply one movement: different rhythms, different durations coexist. The displacement is how the decision to move one way or another takes form. Movement is a process of individuation where matter and form remain in flux, virtually shape-shifting into malleable environments. These environments—alive in the interval—are always singular, but never one.
