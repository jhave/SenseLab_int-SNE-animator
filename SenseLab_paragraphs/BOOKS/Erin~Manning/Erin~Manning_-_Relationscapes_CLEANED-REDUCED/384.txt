Dynamic form is not of an order of poses or privileged instants. Dynamic form is produced through the spectre of immanent movement. Yet dynamism, it bears repeating, is also material. It is force felt— incorporeally material, physically transcendental, intensively mobile. Virtually there. For Deleuze, the cinematic image foregrounds dynamic form. This is because the image can never be fully constrained: it moves, and it will continue to move, even beyond its actual movement. It is virtually there long after the prehension of its poses. Any pose, any stilling of the image, is simply another durational stratum in the complex experience of a lived perception. What the image can do is never exhausted. This is also what Boccioni is trying to say. Although the sculpture seems to give in to the pose, the pose is in fact given to the sculptural movement. You create the pose by prehending it. You actualize it. But its actualization is only as real as the intensive movement that backgrounds it. Any actualization can produce a pose, but this pose will have been created by a mobile cut that is a becoming intensive of extensive movement. The pose is never the starting point. It is what Deleuze calls a crystallization. What you think is stable is only as stable as your capacity to hold it to itself. This is not to suggest that the flux is outside, in excess of, the prehension of a pose. It is simply to say that the event—even the pose—is dynamic, actively becoming in a Spinozean flux of rest and movement. Rhythm is key.
