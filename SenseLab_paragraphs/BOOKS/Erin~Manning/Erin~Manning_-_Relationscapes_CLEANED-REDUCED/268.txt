“The eyes never take in a scene at one go. They rove over objects, detecting edge. The gaze must pass and repass to hold the edge, because edge is actually in continual variation, constantly struck by variations in light and shadow which in any given instant blur its boundary” (Massumi 2006). Co-constituted by a turbulent worlding, vision is not a capturing of the world but a captivating by it. “Even under the most stable of conditions, the eyes add variation through their own micromovements, which never cease. Sight comes of the duration of these variations. Vision finds the edge over and over again, through its variations. The edge’s constantly returning to the eye under variation is what draws out the constancy of its form. Visual constancy is of variational return” (Massumi 2006).
