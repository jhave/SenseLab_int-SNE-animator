We do not see the biogram: we feel the force of its appearance. The biogram provokes invention through its capacity to conjoin, or create new relations. According to Whitehead, appearance brings forth novelty. “In all appearance there is an element of transmutation” (Whitehead 1933, 214). Transmutation from appearance to disappearance is a shift in phase as well as a shift in mode. From the virtual to the actual, from the biogram to the becoming-body, is not a linear transport. It is a transmutation of process-becoming-form. In this intensive passage, the biogram constitutes active points of creation and potentiality through which body-worlds emerge. The biogram itself does not transmute. The biogram is an operational vector in the transmutation from one series to another. As an agent of recombination, the biogram is not actually in time or in space: it is a force through which the imperceptible appears as a feltness of time spacing. The biogram has neither form nor content. It is the intensive passage from force to force that moves a body to express its durational intensity.
