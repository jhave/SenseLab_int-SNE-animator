In “My Translation,” Baggs is clear that words cannot fully convey the affective tonality of the environment that co-constitutes her, leaving us with a sense of hunger for what cannot be expressed. Yet what she does not explicitly say is that this very hunger is also part of how language expresses itself, an appetition that makes thought felt not as an add-on but in its incipient relation to the uniterability of prearticulation. This valuing of emergence complexifies language as the post-iteration of a prefeeling. In My Language makes felt how language moves between planes, exposing the prearticulation of thought as well as the affectivity of expression. Feeling-with becomes a propensity both within and beyond the form-taking of words, a reaching-toward that propels novelty into the world. This novelty is not expressed solely in words, but neither are words precluded from it. The novelty is rhythm, its force of becoming felt as conjunctive in future series that might use words as relational objects.
