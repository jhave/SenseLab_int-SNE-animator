The Deleuzian movement-image provides a vocabulary for thinking the indivisibility of movement cinematically. Movement in the movement-image is not image + movement: it is mobility-becoming-image. Thinking the movement-image sculpturally through Boccioni provokes a movement of thought that encourages us to conceive the surface as a fold rather than an area. “Sculpture must . . . make objects live by showing their extensions in space as sensitive, systematic, and plastic” (Boccioni 1970b, 61). Mattering form implies a becoming-plastic that, in Boccioni’s words, is sensitive and systematic. This pliability of experience is one with the sculptural matter, with its becoming-movement: sculpture becomes a moving-image. If we insist on thinking the image sculpturally—which does not necessarily mean to give it three dimensions, but rather to give it plasticity or topology—the mobile cut can begin to be conceived topologically as well. This allows us to make the shift from a linear action line of shot-cut-shot or frame-movement-frame to the interpenetration of series. It is important to remember that even poses are mobile— movement moving need not refer to extensive movement. As with Boccioni’s sculptures, the mobile cut moves intensively, creating rhythms between rest and movement. Movement-images catch mobility in its passing.
