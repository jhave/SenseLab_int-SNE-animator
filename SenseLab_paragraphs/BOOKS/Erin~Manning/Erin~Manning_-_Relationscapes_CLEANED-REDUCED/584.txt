The diagram of In My Language is felt as the intensity of relation activated through the conjunctive series object-sound-gesture. This series territorializes the musical environment Baggs co-constitutes. Think the diagram as territory beyond representation. Representation solidifies the imaginary of preexistent worlds and asks thought to fit within their borders. Diagrams resist borders, activating tendencies of becoming-form and incipient conjunction. Think the diagram as a landing site you cannot quite define, a site that fields you more than you see it, a focal point through which the work organizes itself in a refrain of infinite unfolding. Diagrams create intensive networks that make thought resonate.
