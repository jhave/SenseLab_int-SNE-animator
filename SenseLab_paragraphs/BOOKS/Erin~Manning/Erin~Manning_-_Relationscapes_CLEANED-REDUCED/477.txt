In Kngwarreyeâ€™s paintings, the paint moves at great speed beyond the edges of the canvas in an exploration not of the beyond itself but of the here and now, a present that is always more than what we can actually perceive. Her art runs, breathless, exhausting our attempt to catch up with it. This is at the heart of the works of Kngwarreye: the experience of sensation as that which moves beyond the landmark, beyond the location or the object of study, toward a direction that is always becoming toward a rhizomatic network shape-shifting from lines to dots, from shade to shade in a living relationscape.
