Emergent evolutions are the individuation of relational fields composed by the activity of small perceptions [les petites perceptions] folding. These microperceptions are perceptions without objects: hallucinatory tendencies in the sense that they express nothing but the emphasis on the quality of becoming. They do not give us a body fully formed or an object-in-place: they fold perception into a becoming-body of movement creating the emphasis of quasi formation that is relation in the making. Small perceptions move the relation event-nexus into infoldings of perception.
