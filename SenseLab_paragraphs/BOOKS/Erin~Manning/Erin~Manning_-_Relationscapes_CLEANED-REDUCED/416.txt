The time of movement is dynamic form. Dynamic form appears in the relation not from body to body but from rhythm to rhythm. An open whole— an atmospherics—is what preoccupies each of Riefenstahl’s images. This whole-which-has-no-parts cannot be divided without changing qualitatively at each stage of the division. Think of the diving sequence. As the women fly off the diving board, they emerge first as individuals, one after the other, named, but soon, and even more so when the sequence shifts to the male divers, a flying takes place where the bodies become-sky, dancing their folds and surfaces in a relatedness that exceeds their individuality. There is no foregrounded individual in these sequences. We take part in a biogram that is a becoming-sky that couples flight and falling, landing, and surfacing. Duration is felt not as measure but as ascending rhythms. The dive itself disappears, and what takes its place is a wholeness of movement that finds expression in the multiple bodybecoming repeating differently each time. A becoming-bird appears that is unforgettable, uncanny, untimely. What moves are superimposed durations of body-becomings, biograms, rhythmically ascending and descending.
