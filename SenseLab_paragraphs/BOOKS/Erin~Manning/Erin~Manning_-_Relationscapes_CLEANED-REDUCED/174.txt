Presentational immediacy works at the perceptual levels of complexity and subtlety, gauging patterns and contrasts. By itself, it does nothing.34 “This mode of perception, taken purely by itself, is barren, because we may not directly connect the qualitative presentations of other things with any intrinsic characters of those things” (Whitehead 1927, 23). To reach the stage of full perception, presentational immediacy must recombine with causal efficacy: “Every actual thing is something by reason of its activity; whereby its nature consists in its relevance to other things, and its individuality consists in its synthesis of other things so far as they are relevant to it” (Whitehead 1927, 25). In presentational immediacy, activity is restricted to self-reference.
