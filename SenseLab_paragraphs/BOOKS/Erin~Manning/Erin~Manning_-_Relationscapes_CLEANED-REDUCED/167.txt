In their process of “awakening,” especially when it becomes apparent that levodopa (L-dopa) is not a wonder drug that will unproblematically continue to work long-term, many of Sacks’s patients begin to invent techniques to keep the infolding at bay. In their “immobilized” states, as described earlier, their experience of space is one of overwhelming smoothness. This smoothness curtails their ability to find or create landmarks. To counter the encroachment of smooth space, they devise ways to create an experience of striation that assists them when they feel the encroachment of inertia. These techniques are modes of bringing space-time into relation.
