When you take the next step, something has happened. Movement has shifted from incipiency toward displacement. The event has taken form, leaving an opening for the next actual occasion. The next actual occasion will build on certain aspects of what just happened, even while it recomposes into new configurations. The causality of perception does not mean that the next actual occasion will be the same. It means that the event of taking the last step makes ingress into the experience of taking the next step. It means your walk moves through movement moving: symbolic reference. To take the next step, you need to feel the experience of relation recomposing beyond the inertia of being. Taking the next step gathers force for becoming.
