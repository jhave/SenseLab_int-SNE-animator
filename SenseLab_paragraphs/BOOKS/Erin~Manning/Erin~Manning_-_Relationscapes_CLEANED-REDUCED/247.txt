Color is an example of an eternal object. Color changes the hue of an event, giving it a tone that casts the event beyond its own satisfaction toward the future foldings of colors intermixing. Think of Robert Irwin’s Who’s Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue (2007). The experience of this installation goes far beyond the memory of the six horizontally laid colored panels. It is an event for color. Who’s Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue reaches across the immediateness of its presentation of primary colors to actually color future experience.59 The exhibit gives itself to perception, attempting not to “show” us color, but to allow color to appear for perception in its primariness and its secondariness (when we look through the yellow panel at the red one, we see orange, and the blue becomes purple). What we experience is a strange perceiving-with-color that colors our perception not only for this event but for all future instances of the active perception of red, yellow, and blue. Who’s Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue makes perception actually appear the way it already does virtually. Having experienced the extraordinary sensation of feeling space color in the active passage of primariness to secondariness, I will never again think I am seeing “just red.”60 What was virtual before this experience has now actualized in my experience of morethan-redness.
