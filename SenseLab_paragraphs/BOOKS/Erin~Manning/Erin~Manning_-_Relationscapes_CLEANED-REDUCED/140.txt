Posture is not a stopping. It is a stilling of the between of the body’s reconfigurations in extensive and intensive space-time. “Between one displacement and the next there is always a moment when the body is, practically speaking, not changing position significantly” (Feldenkrais 1981, 47). Every shift depends on a moving-through. Posture is the quality of the moving-through. It is not a position, not something to aim for or to attain: it is a movement with movement reconfiguring. For Feldenkrais, the relative immobility of the betweenness of posture is not something associated only with humans. All animals have this quality as part of their movement reconfigurations. Feldenkrais calls it “the special characteristic of a given body” (1981, 47).
