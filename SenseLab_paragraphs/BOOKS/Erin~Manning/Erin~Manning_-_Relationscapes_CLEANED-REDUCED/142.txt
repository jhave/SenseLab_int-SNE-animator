A posture is a quality of movement stilling that infects moving. The strange thing about posture is that you can only alter it from within a movement moving. If you try to stop the movement, you donâ€™t get a single posture, you get a multitude of micropostures that move in tandem with the rejigging of micromovements. Stopping is virtually impossible.
