Thought implodes, getting in the way of the potential for release into movement. There is no past or future here. With thought constantly folding-in, the potentiality for an elsewhere folds into itself, becoming yet another fold in the process toward infinite infolding. In the end, there is not even the capacity to conceive of an “elsewhere.” Absolute movement: the incapacity to experience the transduction from incipiency to activation.
