Posture is less a stance than a tendency of momentariness. It is a metastable stilling that leads toward a spinal spiral around which all movement turns. You never reach it once and for all. Posture is a dynamic that is co-constitutive of the body’s tendencies for reconfiguration. That’s why there is no ideal posture: if the tendency of your intensive movement is a fidget or a squirm, the quality of your posture will itself be a squirm in the making. Neither can a posture be an endpoint. Beware of those who tell you to improve your posture. They’re probably the same ones who told you to stand still.
Posture is the intensive magnitude of a movement-forming. It is not the incipiency of a movement as much as the passing-through toward that incipiency. It is the zero-point of absolute movement, the quasi chaos on the cusp of an incipient change in direction.
When we move, we move around the posture’s quasi-chaotic center. It is quasi-chaotic because it contains in their incipiency all of the tendencies for reconfiguration of a movement moving. The most frequent movement for which a standing body prepares itself is a movement around. This turning around the spinal axis will generally revolve around a whole body moving. If the head turns, the shoulders will follow, and then the hips, the knees, the feet. This seemingly organic movement can take many surprising forms.
