Spriggsâ€™s animate sculptures are concrete in the immateriality of their becoming. They make felt how movement propels objects into quasi appearance. Take Incorporeal Movement (2004). This sculpture animates light through the becoming-figural of a three-headed body of red. These three quasi figures are perceived not in their definiteness as three bodies but in a blurry relatedness that disallows a terse separateness. It is as much three bodies becoming one as one body multiplying. What Spriggs airbrushes here is not the final form but its becoming through the mixture of color, light, and shadow. The ethereal quality of the body-becoming-multiple is multiplied by our movement around the sculpture, a movement-with that strangely singularizes the experience (because we still try to focus the image into one head, one form). There is a perceptual play here of singularity and multiplicity, a play as much of light as of form. A play not of shadows but with shadows.
