I see Marey vacillating between creating a body of work that begins and ends where movement stops (quantitative analysis based on measure), and creating a practice that works from the milieu of experiential experimentation (qualitative exploration working through duration). Marey in essence creates an associated milieu of positivism and radical empiricism. Associated milieus can never be distinguished from the techniques of their functioning: they operate and develop through the relations out of which they are constituted. In Marey’s case, his strategies for developing and documenting processes are key both to how results are mapped for scientific publications and to how processes are enhanced through the creation of new experiments. Through this singular associated milieu, Marey’s research alters the ecologies of practices out of which it builds. His work pushes the limits of positivism and brings complexity to the exploration of the concept of relation that is at the heart of radical empiricism.
