For Whitehead, facts are never built out of universals. They emerge from concrete occasions of experience. How these occasions express themselves is the fact of their existence. Napangardi paints matters of fact in flux. The flux is expressed as movement and can be felt through the seriality of her work. Seen as series, Napangardi’s paintings can be said to create a Dreaming nexus. This nexus makes felt the wider complexity of the Dreaming as a continued iteration of experience-in-the-making. As part of a wider extensive continuum115 of Aboriginal Law, Napangardi’s work propels the Dreaming-as-nexus toward an iteration of its potential future form-taking. Future facts have a force of their own. Theirs is a force of becoming, a will to power. This will to power provokes feelings that alter the affective tonality of the present-passing. Painting force taking form is a painting for the future in the present. The force of Napangardi’s vision is her capacity to bridge determinate matters of fact with the future mutations of expression.
