Simultaneous movement implies a transgression of duration: movement not only creating space-time but recomposing the virtual. Preacceleration—intensive movement—keeps the virtual active, poised: a political preemption of the not-yet? All gestures extend beyond what we can perceive into the non-existence of their virtuality. These residues of movement are not lost or stored. They are active: actively virtual. “Organic, yes, but out of the multiplicity of organic virtual bodies that constitute one same body there merges an impossible body, a sort of monstrous body: this is the virtual body. This body prolongs gesture into virtuality, since what follows from gesture can no longer be perceived by an empirical, actual body” (Gil 2002, 123). Politics as radical empiricism.23 As we move our body, we move not only with the force-form that seems palpable—the interval we create—but also with the multiplicity of virtual bodies that recompose along the plane of immanence of our sensing bodies in movement. “The unit of virtual movement (or the virtual unity of movement) creates a space where ‘everything fits,’ a space of coexistence and of consistency of heterogeneous series” (Gil 2002, 123).
