Landing sites corner beginnings. The ambient wholeness of the world at large is impossible to take in. It doesn’t exist without a simplification, a prehension of an aspect of its potential to take form. Landing sites are how that pulling out of the nexus body-world fields an experience. “The more ambiguous the surroundings, the greater the number of imaging landing sites . . . needed for making determinations and giving things shape” (Arakawa and Gins 2002, 17). Imaging landing sites are virtual events in the making. They foreground the kinaesthetic flickering that propels the taking form of an event. In Rosas danst Rosas, the push-pull of the watching-dancing is felt as a tensile relation, an active becoming-with of the event forming. The landing sites of this event in formation give its tonality shape. Landing sites are “event markers in and of the event-fabric that is organism-person-environment” (Arakawa and Gins 2002, 22). Landing sites corner experience in the making.
