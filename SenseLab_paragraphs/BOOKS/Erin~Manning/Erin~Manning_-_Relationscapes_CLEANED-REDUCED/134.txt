Techniques of relation produce events. Every event is relational. Events create relation as much as relation creates events. We cannot know in advance what an event can do, any more than we can know what a body can do. Spinoza’s question will remain unanswered: to know of what a body is capable would be to divest a body of its elasticity. The essence of a technique of relation is not its content per se but its capacity to become more-than and to create more-than. “A conatus is indeed a mode’s essence (or degree of power) once the mode has begun to exist. A mode comes to exist when its extensive parts are extrinsically determined to enter into the relation that characterizes the mode; then, and only then, is its essence itself determined as a conatus” (Deleuze 1990a, 230). Conatus is an affirmative existence, a way of creating a more-than that is not added to the mode but is part of its technique. To create more-than is to move beyond what it seemed a body could do: to transduce a body toward pure plastic rhythm. This striving is not goal-directed. It is a reaching-toward the capacity to inhabit the almost-virtual of the more-than of experience. This more-than will always be the production of a new actual occasion, the creation of a pure experience out of which a world will emerge. Moving the relation is a striving toward the ineffable experience of the elasticity of the almost.
