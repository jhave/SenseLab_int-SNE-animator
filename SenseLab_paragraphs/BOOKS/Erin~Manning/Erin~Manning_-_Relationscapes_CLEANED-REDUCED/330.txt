Like Étienne-Jules Marey before him, McLaren’s experimentation with the incipiency of movement involves creating new techniques to catch movement in its passing. His interest in technique is an exploration with the technicity of the “how” of movement moving: “How it moves is as important as what moves” (McLaren 2006). The how of movement moving is virtual becoming, its preacceleration. Movement’s preacceleration is expressed in animation through the active interval between frames. Thanks to the persistence of vision, the interval between frames remains imperceptible as such, the moving-image apparently a seamless unity across the cuts of the frames. Yet the interval is nonetheless active in the watching: it is a virtual event in which the spectator unwittingly participates. We do not actually see the interval, but we do feel its force as it infolds into the perception of movement moving.
