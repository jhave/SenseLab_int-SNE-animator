Sensing is a topological activity. When we sense, we experience and create folds of space-time. We sense on top of senses, one sense-experience always embedded in another: cross-modal repetition with a difference. For example, when we walk toward a wall, we perceive that wall as limiting our potential displacement, but as we approach it, it also appears as being a certain color or texture. We sense its presence in ways both causal (directly relational) and perceptually nuanced.
