To think the body in terms of appearance and reality is to focus on the body’s unactualized potential as an aspect of its becoming that cannot be realized as such, but can be called forth, adding novelty to its open system. The taking-form of an individuating body is an “appearance” of the body within a vastness of unrealized potential. Technogenesis occurs at the threshold of emergence of the becoming-body where reality is pulled into appearance, and something is added to the mix. This something is a movement-with that provokes a body to become in excess of its organ-ization.
