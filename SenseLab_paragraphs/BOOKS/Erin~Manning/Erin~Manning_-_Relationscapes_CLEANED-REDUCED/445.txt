For Aborigines, life is Dreaming in the sense that the coordinates of space-time out of which everyday lives emerge are significantly in line with the creation and recreation of the land and its Laws. But even this is too simple: the land is not an extension of the Aboriginesâ€”it is them. To be the land is to become in relation to it: in relation not to space itself but to the living coordinates of a topological relationscape that embodies as much the Law as it does the grains of sand that prolong it in real time. The land and the Law are not two, are not juxtaposed. They are not sustained in a present-future symbolism. They are one: a becoming multiplicity.
