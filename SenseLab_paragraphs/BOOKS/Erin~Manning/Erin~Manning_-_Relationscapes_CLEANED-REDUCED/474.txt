Relationscapes are a way of conceptualizing the Dreaming. Consider the work of Emily Kngwarreye, Dorothy Napangardi, and Kathleen Petyarre. Kngwarreye’s work in particular propels a sensing-across that projects the viewer into a velocity of experience that far exceeds the breadth of the painted surface. Born and raised in Alhalkere, a country that extends northwest of the Utopia boundary onto Mount Skinner Station, Kngwarreye’s art is known for its abstraction and its resistance to the specificity of content. Kngwarreye started painting when she was nearly eighty years old. At Utopia, the main focus had been batik, a practice in which Kngwarreye had been an adept for at least ten years before taking up acrylic paints.
