In My Language feels untimely. It takes us out of the time of language as enunciation to the time-pressure of conceptual prearticulation. We feel the force of expression taking form even as we remain unsure of what is actually being said. Amanda Baggs asks for our participation in this becoming-environment of language taking form. As we participate in this process, we feel language as a collaborative event. We experience prearticulation and are gathered in the relationscape this tending-toward language provokes.
