Incorporeal Movement appears for perception. It appears if we actively perceive it. Virtually. It makes us move. We move to make it reappear. And as it reappears, we become aware of the ways in which it disappears. This disappearance occurs because the work isn’t actually all there for the perceptual taking. It’s there for the making, for the re-making through movement-perception. What we see: rhythms of color and light on the cusp of becoming shapes. Force-lines for perception in the making.
