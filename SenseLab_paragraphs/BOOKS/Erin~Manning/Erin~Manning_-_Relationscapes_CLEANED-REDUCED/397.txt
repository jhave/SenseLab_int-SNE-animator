And yet, as though called back by the transcendental of fascist doxa, the body suddenly becomes disciplined, all subtlety cast aside. As though in direct contact with the transcendent disciplinarity of the absolute state, the undulating series of pins-bodies dancing organizes itself in firm, straight lines. From flow to square, from becoming to being, the camera reveals a sudden materializing of the plane of organization. Physical transcendence always risks being captured by the war machine of the totalitarian state.
Riefenstahlâ€™s films develop the concept of dynamic form in Boccioni and the mobile cut in Deleuze/Bergson to arrive at a reassertion of the ways in which movement privileges expression over content. The foregrounding of dynamic form suggests that Riefenstahl composes with fascism but does not compose a fascist (disciplinary) body. What she composes is the expression of a becoming-body symbiotically linked to fascism but in excess of its disciplinarity. Riefenstahl composes-with. She begins with the beautiful, the young, the strong, but what she composes is never a particular or individual body. Movement is the commanding form of her work.
