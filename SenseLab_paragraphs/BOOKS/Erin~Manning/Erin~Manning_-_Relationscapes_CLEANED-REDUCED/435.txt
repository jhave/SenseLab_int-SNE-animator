Mina Mina envelops space, creating new space-times of experience. It literally quivers with its dissonant becomings. This is not a metaphor. Space-time is ontogenetically recreated through the process. The painting proposes new modes of viewing, a seeing-in-movement that incites us to move. We become part of the composition, part of the activity of relation through which the painting achieves its morphing form. We feel its limits even as its limits field us.
