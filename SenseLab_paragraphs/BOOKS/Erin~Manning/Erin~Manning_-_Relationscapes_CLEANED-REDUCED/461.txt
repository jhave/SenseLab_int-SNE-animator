Topological space-time refutes the dichotomy between the abstract and the concrete. Topological space-time is not 1 + 1 but n + 1, always more-than. The Dreaming is an evocation of such a topological space-time of experience. It situates land, body, space, time, experience all in one structural node, an elastic point that fields the perpetual movement of time. Topological rendering relationally connects nature and existence, insisting that no single element be a permanent support for changing relations. In this relational network of experience, innovation is at stake even while the traditions of the past carry weight in the present. Innovation does not mean the erasure of the past. It means creating a foundation for the shifting relations of past and future in the present passing. Through the Dreaming, a multiplicity of worldings emerges. At the creation of each new experience, the many become one and are increased by one.99
Topology refers to a continuity of transformation that alters the figure, bringing to the fore not the coordinates of form but the experience of it. Topologies suggest that the space of the body extends beyond Euclidean coordinates to an embodiment of folding space-times of experience: pure plastic rhythm. As Massumi asks, “What if the body is inseparable from dimensions of lived abstractness that cannot be conceptualized in other than topological terms?” (2002, 177). To think topologically is to think beyond preexistent coordinates, be they for a body, a territory, a landscape, a law.
