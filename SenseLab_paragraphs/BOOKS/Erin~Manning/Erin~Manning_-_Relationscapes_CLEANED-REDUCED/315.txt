Techniques of relation such as those Marey invents are abstract machines,72 abstract because what they can do is outside the realm of the prethought. Marey’s abstract machines for perception operate through the emergences they provoke, forecasting futurity in the making. “When we speak of abstract machines, by ‘abstract’ we also mean ‘extract’ in the sense of extraction. These are montages susceptible of putting into relation all heterogeneous levels that move through them” (Guattari 1995, 55). Marey’s machines extract the imperceptible, bringing it to the fore not as material for measure but as ephemera for experience. We will never actually see incipiency passing through preacceleration to the interval of movement moving, but we can experience it. This is the richness of Marey’s images, which extract the unknowable and force its recomposition with the actual such that a becoming-form begins to act on the incorporeality of its recomposing. Abstract machines do not impose form onto matter, they are processes (of) in-formation, continually, rhythmically recasting the heterogeneous processes out of which they themselves are emergent.
