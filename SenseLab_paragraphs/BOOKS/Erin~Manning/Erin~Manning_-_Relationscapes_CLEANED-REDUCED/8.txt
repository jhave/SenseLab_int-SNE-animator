In 2005, with members of the Sense Lab and the Workshop in Radical Empiricism, Brian Massumi and I started thinking about how we might envision a collaborative event that would create a movement of thought. For over a year, we considered what constitutes an event and how techniques of creation create concepts-in-the-making. In May 2006, the Sense Lab hosted “Dancing the Virtual,” the first of four events scheduled to take place over a four-year period under the larger rubric of Technologies of Lived Abstraction.
“Dancing the Virtual” was conceived as a challenge to the often upheld dichotomy between creation and thought/ research. The specific aim of “Dancing the Virtual” was to produce a platform for speculative pragmatism where what begins technically as a movement is immediately a movement of thought. In the active passage between movement and movements of thought, the participants of “Dancing the Virtual” collaboratively began to build a repertoire of new techniques for experimentation that performatively bridge the gap between thinking/speaking and doing/creating. Not only did this facilitate creation and communication across fields of inquiry during the event itself, it also provoked a continued exploration among many participants of ways to orchestrate future participatory events that challenge the active/ passive model of speaker/listener or artist/spectator. For the events in the Technologies of Lived Abstraction series, new forms of collaboration are conceived not simply as locales for experimentation but as matrices of cultural becoming. We want experimentation to function as much at the collective level as at the conceptual level.
