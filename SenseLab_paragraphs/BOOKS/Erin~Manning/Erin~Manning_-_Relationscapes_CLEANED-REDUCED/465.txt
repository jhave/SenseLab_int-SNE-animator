The Western tradition of landscape art has taught us to read paintings (and most perspectival visual phenomena) as maps. Perspective is not innate, however: it is taught. Recent research, in fact, suggests that humans orient more by the shape of the space than by its visual cues. This suggests that we orient rhythmically, responding to the movements of topological twistings and turnings.101 This way of fielding space foregrounds the proprioceptive sense, inverting the relation of position to movement. When movement is no longer indexed to position (when mapping becomes an event), position itself becomes mobile. This is the case with Clifford Possum’s maps. Whether or not they are all spatially “correct” in relation to pregiven landmarks is not the issue. What matters is not the position—not where the territories lie as such—but what they are capable of in relation to the emergent bodies the Dreamings make possible.
