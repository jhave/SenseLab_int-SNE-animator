Transduction is a durational process whereby what is transformed becomes a worlding rather than simply an effect on an already-constituted system. Transduction alters the conditions of a process. Can digital technologies create ontogenetic conditions for emergent body-worlds? Is it possible for new technologies to perceive the virtual effects of force taking form in the virtual-actual passage from reality to appearance, to feel the incipience of movement, to sense-with sensing bodies in movement, “catching” pure plastic rhythm in its passing? Can new technology engage the virtuality of pastness, making its effects felt? This is not simply a question “of the superiority of the analog,”53 but a question to technogenesis itself. Can technology play the virtual?
The virtual is played by a dancing body through preacceleration. Yet it bears repeating: virtuality is not something digital technologies are yet able to tap into. How to create functioning parameters for software development on the basis of something that cannot be known, that can only be felt in its effects? Technology becoming technogenetic involves inflecting the digital with virtual potential, bringing to the fore movement’s incipiency and its relational matrix. How does a movement that cannot yet be seen make itself known?
