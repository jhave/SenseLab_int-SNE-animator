“It was been said that my work is ‘always the same old thing.’ This assessment
. . . is the greatest reward for my efforts,” writes Marey (qtd. in Dagognet 1992, 63). Marey’s perception machines for movement in the making are repetitions with a difference. Each machine does something new, yet retains a similar problem: to map the invisible. The combination of elements tends to be quite similar from one machine to another: a sensor attached to the object of study or used to measure the force of movement, a conductor, and an inscriber. Yet “the same old thing” is more a force of transduction than it is a crude repetition of the same.
