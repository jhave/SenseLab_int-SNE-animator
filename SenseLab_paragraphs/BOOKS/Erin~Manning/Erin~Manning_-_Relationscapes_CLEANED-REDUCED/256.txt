Folding into perception is moving-with the virtual resonance of force taking form. Perception is in the folds, not of the folds. It has no object as such. Folding into perception is sensing-with the world worlding. Perceiving pulls out singularity: this is what we identify in its passing as an object. What we perceive is the object’s capacity to create contrasts, to differentiate the nexus: “It is that the perceived resembles something it forces us to think” (Deleuze 1993, 95; translation modified). The quality of perceptibility—the whiteness, for instance—calls forth a feeling for white. I think cappuccino foam. This perception creates a feeling for coffee.
