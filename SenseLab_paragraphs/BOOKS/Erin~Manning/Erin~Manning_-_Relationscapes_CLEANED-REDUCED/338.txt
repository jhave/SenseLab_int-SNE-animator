Abstract ballet divests ballet of its fixity, foregrounding the experience of movement’s taking form as accompanied by the techniques implicit in movement’s execution. Abstract ballet does not devise a movement that negates ballet’s precision. Rather, it foregrounds the quality of the interval that emerges between the rehearsed, ordered, precise techniques of balance, strength, and extension that define ballet. In this regard, McLaren’s exploration of the affective potential of balletic precision is close to the work of the Frankfurt Ballet as choreographed by William Forsythe, where what is foregrounded is not the hold ballet has on movement, but its potential to use techniques to transduce the precision of pose into the qualitative open-endedness of force taking form. Foregrounding the affective tonality of ballet’s technicity gives McLaren’s film its grace. Pas de deux is an experience of grace taking form.
