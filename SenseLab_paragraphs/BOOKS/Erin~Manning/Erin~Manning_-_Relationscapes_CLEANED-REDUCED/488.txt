It is in large part the figurative that has sustained the appropriation of the landscape for the colonizing gaze. What would it mean to wrest the figure from the figurative? In Kngwarreye’s work, the figure is the movement of becoming itself.109 Her paintings are topological deformations that make sensible the untouchable. The bodies at hand—the root systems, the animals—extend beyond their coordinates in a Euclidean space-time, immanent to the space-time of creation. Kngwarreye creates, not by imposing form onto the canvas or by representing space, but by engaging the running as it runs.
