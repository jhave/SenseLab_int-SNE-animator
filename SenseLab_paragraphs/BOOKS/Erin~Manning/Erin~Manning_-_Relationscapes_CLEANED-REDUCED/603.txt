An appetite for experimentation must always be connected to concrescence. A completely open system gives nothing but more openness (closure). Feeling is power’s “compulsion of composition” (Whitehead 1929/1978, 119). This compulsion to compose is an aesthetic drive, a will toward sensation, a will to power. The will to power is not about individual power. The will to power activates the potential of a force to move a body to its limit. Power is a lure for feeling. Before Nietzsche called it the Will to Power, he called it the “feeling of power” (1968).
