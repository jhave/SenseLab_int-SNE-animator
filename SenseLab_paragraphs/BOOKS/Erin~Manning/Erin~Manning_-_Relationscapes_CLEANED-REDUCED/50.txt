The time of the interval is incipiency. This is a future-past that is prolonged at the interface of the becoming-actual of the virtual. Just because you cannot see the interval does not mean it’s not real. The interval’s concreteness is what allows me to feel the movement in the before or the even-as of my body’s displacement. I can’t think fast enough to catch the interval in the making. The interval is the production of movement before we know it as such. It is the residual we tap into in a quick change of direction that causes her leg to fly into the air, magically circling her already recomposing body. The interval is salient throughout, but I cannot name it or locate it exactly. I feel it only momentarily in the instant where I catch a glimpse of her eyes wide with wonder asking herself, “How did I do that?”
