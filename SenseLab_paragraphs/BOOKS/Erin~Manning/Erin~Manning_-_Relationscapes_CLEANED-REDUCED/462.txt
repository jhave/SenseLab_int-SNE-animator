Dreamings break down the dichotomy between the abstract and the concrete. In the Dreaming, concrete and abstract overlap. The Dreaming does not function wholly abstractly or wholly concretely. It moves through their interval, giving no more credence to the now of flesh than to the virtuality of spiritual evocations of the landscape. This continuity of the actual and the virtual creates a law of alliance that is neither concrete nor abstract. This law of alliance rests on an implicit understanding that space-time is as spiritual as it is physical, as topological as it is geographic. The landscape moves, and with it, the Dreamings shift and bodies metamorphose.
