Karntakurlangu Jukurrpa (2000a) is composed of unevenly spaced squares composed of meandering dots. The effect is of geometrical shapes emerging from the two-dimensional canvas with virtual pathways between them revealing lines in the making. The edges of the canvas are whiter, which makes them recede, calling attention to the canvas’s disjunctive center. As in all of Napangardi’s work, the diagram is wide, yet restrained. It feels as though the force of the work is an emergent way of looking more than an actual taking-form. The diagram of the painting—its feeling of force taking form—is itself in movement.
