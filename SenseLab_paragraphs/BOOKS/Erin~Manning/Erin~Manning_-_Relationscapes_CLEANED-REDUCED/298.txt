For Marey, there seems to be no contradiction in the pursuit of positivism through experimentation: Marey sees experimentation as a necessary tool for the production of quantifiable results. The criteria of positivism—“a rejection of metaphysics and in its place an affirmation of facts derived from observation; the proposition that science constituted the ideal form of knowledge; and the understanding that scientific explanations of phenomena would, by definition, lead to one or more laws of which an individual phenomenon is an observed instance” (Braun 1992, 13)—are amply met by the experimental methodology he pursues. And yet, as is becoming apparent, there is also within his work a fascination with the milieu itself and the intensities it is capable of producing. This can be observed in his magnificent sculptural rendition of the seagulls, Flight of the Seagull: 25 Images per Second (1887), which brings to life the in-between stages of the bird’s flight. If Marey were interested only in the quantitative analysis of the movement of the bird’s wings, why would he have the resulting image sculpted in bronze?
