Olympia never introduces a stable body. Rather, she foregrounds a body that provokes relations between nodes of appearance-disappearance that take form through images intense in their capacity to shape-shift. The body always appears in its splendid materiality at the very cusp of its disappearance. This body-becoming is as alive as the light dancing in the arms-grass-hoop series, and as virtual as the fluid movements of stone, embodying an aesthetics both terrifyingly fascist and biopolitically inventive. This fascism is not “readymade,” not located in the body as already-formed. In Olympia we encounter a much more evasive fascism: the fascism of the in-between where biopolitics calls forth a biogram.
