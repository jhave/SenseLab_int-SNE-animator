Affective duration is felt in Marey’s experiments through the image’s force of composition. This composition is not a translation: it is a transduction of movement into sensation through the prism of the image, foregrounding the quasi chaos of movement’s incipiency. This mode of seeing is not strictly a looking-for—a looking “for” the form passing through, for instance—it is a looking-with. It is a looking-with because not only do we feel the movement of the images, we feel the holes through which the images leak. In the smoke images, it is as though the smoke were still filtering through our experience of looking. This is what Bergson means when he says that “a world well perceived is a world that never ceases to move” (1990, 343–344). A world well perceived is a perception of the (w)holes of vision where movement commingles with experience to produce expressions of novelty.
