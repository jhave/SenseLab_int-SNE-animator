The military measure of the disciplined marching is predominant and overpowering without being the only rhythm at play. There is a fissure here between what we hear and what we see, a strange cadence in step with a rhythmic disequilibrium, provoking a slight fissure in the interval between the planes of composition and organization. And then an incredible shot: a sea of flags. A rhythm all its own, the flags create a moving landscape, a play of texture and force that never quite takes form as a unified entity. In the creation of this plane of consistency, the image is immediately transported onto the plane of physical transcendence. As the camera pans out, we feel movement marching to the rhythm of pure charisma.
