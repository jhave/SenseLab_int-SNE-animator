To “know negatively” is to proceed backwards from presentational immediacy into its infernal decomposition toward nothingness. It is to experience presentational immediacy without the relationships set up by causal efficacy, to apply the disparate onto the disparate, the qualitative onto the qualitative, ad infinitum. This infinite infolding means that there is never any “satisfaction” of the actual occasion. Never any completion to an event. What is sensed is sensed as bare sensa without altering the body-world relation, and thus without limit. All event means no event.
