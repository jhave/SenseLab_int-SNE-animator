Bridging a vocabulary of movement with one of language requires concepts for thinking affective resonance within linguistic enunciation. Here, Andrei Tarkovsky’s concept of editing might be useful. For Tarkovsky, editing is immanent to the flow of audio-images that make up the film as captured on camera. Editing is not something you impose onto the work: it is a prehension of the rhythms already virtually present in the work. Editing foregrounds the backgrounded rhythm of the work. In Baggs’s video, editing functions not as the after-effect of language’s imposed structure on her musical environment. Editing from within is the way language speaks through her tonal dance, the way its prearticulations can already be felt in the intervals out of which thought is provoked.
