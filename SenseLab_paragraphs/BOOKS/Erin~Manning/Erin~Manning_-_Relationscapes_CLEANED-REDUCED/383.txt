On a topological surface, all cuts are mobile: the mobile cut defies strict succession. A mobile cut demands of the surface that it be infinitely mobile. It does not presume that movement begins only once the frames meet, assisted by the projector. Movement is folded into image, becomes image: there is no fold that cannot be folded again. Pastness envelops futurity, bleeding time into movement and movement into time. The duration—the space-time—of a topological surface is intensively extensive, continually recomposing along new curves.
