Smooth space feels empty: it mimics the infolding space-time of extreme Parkinsonism. “Many of the symptoms and features of Parkinsonism, especially ‘freezing,’ are due to getting stuck in a Parkinsonian emptiness or vacuum. Stuckness gives rise to more stuckness, or paralysis, or entrancement of attention—on there being . . . no proper object for attention” (Sacks 1990, 63n47). There being no discrete appearance for perception is the felt-effect of dwelling in presentational immediacy, where infinities of nuance take hold and go nowhere. To feel without the capacity to do is to be imprisoned in the midst of sensa without the capacity to make connections. Connections come from past recombinations activated in a present. These recombinations are techniques for relation that activate experience even as they add to it.
