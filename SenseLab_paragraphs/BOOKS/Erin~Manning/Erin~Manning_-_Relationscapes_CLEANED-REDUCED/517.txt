In addition to the color creating a foregrounding of flowing form, the size of the dots gives the work a pulsating rhythm. Dots are of different size and consistency throughout Napangardi’s work, but here, the contrast in size is felt singularly as a movement-toward, an inner vibration of a shallow relief created by the pulsation. This is a subtle relief, almost in two dimensions. What we feel is not “landscape” per se, nor “color” in its definiteness, but the very rhythm of the landscape taking form through color. We feel the affective tonality of the composition composing itself. If we abandon ourselves to perception, we see not simply color but its force taking form. In the almost-color of the between, the landscape’s color emerges.
