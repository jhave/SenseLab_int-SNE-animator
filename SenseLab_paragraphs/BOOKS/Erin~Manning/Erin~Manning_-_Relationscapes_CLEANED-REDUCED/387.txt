Dalcroze began his research with an interesting question: how is rhythm felt? In the course of his exploration into the varieties of modes of hearing and feeling rhythm, Dalcroze discovered that rhythm is not solely of the ear. It is amodal, and even more than that, it is virtually physical. This discovery led him to question how rhythm was taught. Too often, he observed, rhythm is conceived as an external meter for an internal process. Yet rhythm, he writes, “call[s] for the muscular and nervous response of the whole organism” (Dalcroze 1921, vi). Developing an early vocabulary for kinaesthesia and proprioception, Dalcroze noted that “sufficient attention is not paid to the determination and analysis of the relations undoubtedly existing between sound and dynamics, between pitch and accentuation, between the varying tempi of musical rhythms and the choice of harmonies” (1921, 6).
