For Amanda Baggs, relations are immanent. They bring forth responsive environments, activating movements of thought. Degrees of intimacy modulate the process. In Baggsâ€™s video, there is a tendencial shift between relations of sound and relations of movement. We see this in the passage from the sound-making platforms in the early sequences (such as the computer bag) to the later movement-feeling platforms (such as the knob). These platforms bring to the fore different relays for relation, emphasizing rhythm as the force that underlies the movement of sound. This thinking-in-motion is a technique. In My Language is, finally, a platform for experimenting with techniques of relation that move toward various forms of prearticulation and concept formation.
