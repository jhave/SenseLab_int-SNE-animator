Focusing on perception as an activity allows Whitehead to reconceptualize the vocabulary of preformation (where perception is contained by a preformed world). Prehension for Whitehead is perception as event. An actual occasion is the expression of a particular prehension—or set of prehensions—that eventually converges into a subjective form. The subjective form is not the form of the object itself. It is the coming-into-form of the ontogenetic process out of which its objectness—its eventness—comes to the fore. We never prehend an object as such. The objectness of the prehension forms in the eventness that is the actual occasion. Objects emerge in relation as events of experience. As an object begins to take form, its process concresces such that it becomes more stable (and recognizable as such). This (meta)stability (the object having reached its eventness or subjective form) is the beginning of the inevitable perishing of the actual occasion, which creates an opening for new experience to take form. As the actual occasion perishes, it populates the nexus of pastness. The nexus as such cannot be perceived. But parts of it can (and will) be reactivated in future actual occasions.
