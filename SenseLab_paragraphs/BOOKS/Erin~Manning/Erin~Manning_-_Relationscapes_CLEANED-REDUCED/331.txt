In his work, McLaren explores the feeling of movement moving. He asks: How do we activate this feeling, and keep it active in perception? To make incipiency appear, McLaren privileges movement over “content”: “For me, the ‘purest’ cinema is that which communicates the essential of information, thought, and sentiment by movement itself, and allows no other factor or almost to intervene” (qtd. in McWilliams 1990, 17; my translation). To allow no other factor to interfere ensures that movement remains the subject of animation.
