Physical transcendentalism is not the annihilation of matter. What could be more material than sculpture? Physical transcendentalism is a way to think matter in movement. It decries the tendency of stabilizing matter into finite form. In physical transcendentalism, movement becomes the plane of immanence through which the becoming-body emerges physically. This physicality is transcendental because the body transcends the immanence even while the movement itself remains immanent. Physical transcendence is a way of conceptualizing the mattering of immanence, the cusp of its becoming actual when what appears is not the body as such but its biogram, the becoming-body at the threshold of appearance/disappearance.
