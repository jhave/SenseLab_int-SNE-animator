To paint technique is to work with the potential of the tools to tell their own story. Instead of giving the form particular content, drawing (with) the technique allows Napangardi to create works that are evocative in their multiplicity while still returning to the ways of speaking, of dancing or singing, of her people. Her paintings evoke the “how” of her culture, keeping the “what” more private. Since the late 1990s, when she started to focus on Mina Mina in her paintings, Napangardi has given most of her paintings two titles: Salt on Mina Mina and Karntakurlangu Jukurrpa (Digging-Stick-Possessing Dreaming). There are other titles such as Rain on Mina Mina, Sandhills of Mina Mina, Women’s Dreaming, Karlangu, Inland Sea, but these seem not so much different subjects for painting as different aspects of the two main lineages. What is fascinating about this focus of hers is the way in which her work creates difference within repetition. Returning time and again to the digging sticks, to the dried up lake at Mina Mina (Ngayurru or Lake McKay), to the Women’s Dreaming at this site, she creates an infinity of iterations within one larger theme, each of them a dif-
ferent rhythm dancing the same infinite dance.
