Standing still is often associated to posture. “Stand still!” sounds to me like “Stand up straight!” Yet, like “stillness,” posture is elusive. Posture is less a stopping of movement than a passing-through. If standing still is a shifting between thousands of micromovements in the making, posture is how its incipient action is felt.
Moshe Feldenkrais defines posture as “dynamic equilibrium.” He suggests that posture is how we move through. Posture is how we carry our movement stilling. This movement stilling is allied to the movements of experiential space-time. We move with the reaching-toward of experience as it moves us.
