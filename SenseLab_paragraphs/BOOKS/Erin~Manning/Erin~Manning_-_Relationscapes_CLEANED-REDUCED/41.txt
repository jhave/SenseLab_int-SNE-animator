The room becomes configuring as the body recomposes. There is no “body itself ” here because the body is always more than “itself,” always reaching toward that which it is not yet. The not-yet takes form through the intensities of preacceleration that compel recompositions at the level of both strata, the body and the room. What this means is that both body and space are experienced as alive with potential movement. The body-room series takes on an infinite variety of potential velocities. These velocities take form at certain intervals, remaining virtual at others. The body-room stratum is therefore neither object nor form, but infinite potential for recombination. When an event takes form within this malleable stratum, there is a configuration. Displacement is one such event. When a displacement actually occurs—directing the force of preacceleration that holds the series in anticipation—a shift takes place that alters the coordinates of space-time, beginning the process anew, bringing new configurations to the machinic phylum body-room.
