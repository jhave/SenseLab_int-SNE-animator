Concepts are events in the making. An event in the making is a thought on the cusp of articulationâ€”a prearticulated thought in motion. How thoughts in motion become articulations is the subject of Relationscapes: Movement, Art, Philosophy. Throughout, my concern is to address the malleability of concepts that move, the expressivity of thoughts as they become feelings, the ontogenetic potential of ideas as they become articulations. This complex passage from thought to feeling to concepts-in-prearticulation to events-in-the-making foregrounds how thinking is more than the discrete final form it takes in language. To come to language is more than to finalize form. To come to language is to feel the form-taking of concepts as they prearticulate thoughts/feelings.
