To ground, when dancing, is to alter the composition body-floor such that the ground actively relocates in relation to dynamic movement. Movement here is never simply movement-in-space. It is movement-with-space that qualitatively alters the duration of experience. To say that the ground is “beneath her feet” is to misunderstand the very mobility of groundedness.
