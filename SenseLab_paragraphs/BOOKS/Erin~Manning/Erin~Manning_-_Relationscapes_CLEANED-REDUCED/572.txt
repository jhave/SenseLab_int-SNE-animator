Throughout “My Translation,” as Baggs attempts to articulate her complex multisensory environment through words, she continues to create relational encounters that render the linguistic space more intricate than words can connote. She speaks, but she also rocks, smells, touches, tastes, observes, feeling-with the environment. The experience of watching her articulating space-times of experience suggests that there is something about the eventness of Baggs’s responsive environment that we’ll never know, because to know it is to feel it. Communication through words will always fall short. Yet there is no question that articulation through language is capable of conveying a certain complexity, bridging the worlds of sensory eventness with the affective tonality of language in the making such that a dialogue between these co-arising worlds can begin. In “My Translation,” Baggs begins to show us how to articulate felt thought.
