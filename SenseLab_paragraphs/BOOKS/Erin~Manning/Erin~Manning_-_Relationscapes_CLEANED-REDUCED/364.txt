The biogram is closely related to Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of the diagram. The diagram is defined as the conjunctive force that in-gathers an artwork’s intensity. Deleuze and Guattari build on this concept of the diagram, suggesting that a diagram is in fact an abstract machine, that “constitutes and conjugates all of the assemblage’s cutting edges of deterritorialization” (1987, 141). By this, they mean that a diagram is a technique or series of techniques for the open conjugation of intensities. The diagram is not content driven—it operates at the interstices of composition where the virtual is felt as a force of becoming. From diagram to biogram is a passage through a different abstract machine, one connected to the techniques of appearance and disappearance of a becoming-body. In the case of Riefenstahl, I foreground the biogram because the abstract machine of recombination in her work is one that works specifically on the body.
The series in Riefenstahl are conjugated by biograms that provoke body resonances. They introduce new ways of composing a body. The biogram is what conjugates rhythms of appearance-disappearance for the becoming-body. These are rhythms of speed and slowness, rhythms alive in the nuances of movement moving. Riefenstahl’s biograms move across consistencies, creating textures rather than forms. Through the biogram, we experience exfoliation, not a ball; flight, not a javelin; tangles, not limbs. We feel the quality of elasticity before we experience form. The biogram is the becoming-body’s intensive edge that makes bodyness felt at the conjunction of image and movement.
