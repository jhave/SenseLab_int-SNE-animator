When we see-with, what we perceive is the feeling of intensity. We feel intensity without seeing its actual form. The feeling of intensity coexists virtually with what actually appears. Intensity is of duration, not measure. Intensity has no extensive magnitude—it cannot be conceived as separate from pure experience. Positivism’s shortfall is its tendency to attempt to capture intensity’s extension for a quantitative system of measure.
