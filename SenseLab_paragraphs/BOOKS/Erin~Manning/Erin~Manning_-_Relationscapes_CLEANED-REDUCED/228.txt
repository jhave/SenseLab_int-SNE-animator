To think technogenetically, we must keep in mind that we perceive not an object-as-such but how the object merges with experience: the object is its experiential function. Objects are novel because their conjunctions are new, not preexisting them, but immanent to them. Objects, prehended, are individuations within an ecology of practices wherein perception is key. Non-sensuous perception is an activity of relation whereby the composition of an event takes place through a re-uptake of the virtual (immannce) into the actual (appearance). Through non-sensuous perception we directly perceive relation. In Whiteheadian terms, we prehend the affective tone—the relational concernedness—of an object-becoming-world.
