There is an important difference to be made between movement and autoactivation, especially if activation is linked to displacement. According to their own accounts, Sacks’s patients do not associate the “catatonic” phase of the disease with a total loss of movement. What they experience seems to be closer to absolute movement—a degree-zero of movement—than to a complete stopping. Absolute movement as they describe it is movement without auto-activation. They feel movement, but cannot translate the feeling into displacement. In their “frozen” states, this absoluteness becomes severe inertia.
Inertia is the property of a body by virtue of which it tends to persist in a state of rest or uniform motion unless it is acted upon by an external force. Inertia does not imply a total loss of movement: it suggests an inability to activate a change in state. An inertial body is still moving, but its movement is absolute: movement without punctuation or change in degree. Absolute movement is the complete smoothness of movement, felt as a loss of differentiation of space or time.
