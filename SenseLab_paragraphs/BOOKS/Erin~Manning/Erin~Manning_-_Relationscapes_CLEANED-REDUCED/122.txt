The elasticity of the almost is textured, its texture that of unbounded creativity. The movement’s elastic point produces conjunction, but not conjunction in a one-to-one relation. What is produced is the conjunction of the one-many, of the infinity of potential series coming together. This coming-together is a concrescence. It is a growing together activated through the elastic point, not a coming together of two subjectivities or two movements, but the germ of pure experience—novelty in the making—expressing itself. “No things are ‘together’ except in experience; and no things are, in any sense of ‘are,’ except as components in experience or as immediacies of process which are occasions in selfcreation” (Whitehead 1933, 236).
