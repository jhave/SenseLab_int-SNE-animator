The prosthetic suggests a vocabulary of the more-than. Within this vocabulary, the “than”—the body, usually—tends to be thought as an already-formulated entity. Concepts such as the machinic (Deleuze and Guattari41), the Body without Organs (Artaud42), the posthuman (Hayles43), and originary technicity (Derrida44), explicitly challenge the notion that the body could be reduced to a “thanness” that would need to be supplemented to create a body that was “morethan” its organic envelope. They suggest that a body is always already more-than, refuting the logic of the “than” that would need to be prosthetically enhanced to reach its more-than state. Refuting the thanness that supposedly becomes prosthetically enhanced, such concepts as these suggest that the “more than” is the very condition of the becoming-body.
