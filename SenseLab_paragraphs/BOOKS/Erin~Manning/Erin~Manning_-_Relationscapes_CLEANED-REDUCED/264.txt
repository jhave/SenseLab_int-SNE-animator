In true positivist form, Marey believed in the mechanics of what could be proven. “Science has two obstacles that block its advance, first the defective capacity of our senses for discovering truths, and then the insufficiency of language for expressing and transmitting those we have acquired. The aim of scientific method is to remove these obstacles” (Marey, qtd. in Braun 1992, 12– 13). Experimentation through visualization always preceded documentation for Marey. His first concern was to find ways to develop insights into movement through representations made visible early on by his graphic machines, and later by chronophotographs. His aim was to find quantitative modes of analysis to make us see what seeing obstructed. This paradoxical investment in vision is one of the astounding aspects of Marey’s work on movement. Although he never explicitly mentions the role of perception in his experiments, his work specifically brings to the fore the complexity of mechanisms of perception as linked to movement. The images Marey creates are both given to and engaged in perceptual experimentation.
