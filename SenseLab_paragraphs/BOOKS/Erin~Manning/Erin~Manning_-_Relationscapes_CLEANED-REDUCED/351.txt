Then a face, made of stone and yet almost alive, the almost-flesh of the sculpture caught in a dissolve as the music quietens. Trumpets sound and another stone face enters the image in close-up against a dark background, caught in the between of night and day. As though from below, the next stone figure appears, moving still, shifting into the disappearance of the face that came before.
