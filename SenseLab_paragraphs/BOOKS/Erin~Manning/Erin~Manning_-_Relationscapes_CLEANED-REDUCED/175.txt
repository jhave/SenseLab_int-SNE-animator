Symbolic reference, the culmination of perception into relational synthesis, occurs when the modes of causal efficacy and presentational immediacy overlap and intertwine, when the direct action of relation is experienced alongside the qualities evoked through perceptual morphogenesis. The folding of presentational immediacy into causal efficacy and vice versa captures the eventness of experience both as that which participates in the nuances of sensing and as the immediateness of relation. Causal efficacy provides the datum for presentational immediacy, and presentational immediacy propels the immediate givenness of the causal event toward the complexity of lived experience.
