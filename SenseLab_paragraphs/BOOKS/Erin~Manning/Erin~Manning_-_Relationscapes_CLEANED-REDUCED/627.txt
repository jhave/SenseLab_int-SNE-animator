Thought is a force to contend with. Thought moves (with) language, affectively altering what language can do. Concepts foreground the capacity to be affected through language. To be affected is to go to the limit of what a thought can do. “The philosopher creates concepts that are neither eternal nor historical but untimely and not of the present . . . untimely at every epoch” (Deleuze 1993, 107). Concepts are activities of relation that take time even as they make time, animated in the process of invention that is the activity of living.
