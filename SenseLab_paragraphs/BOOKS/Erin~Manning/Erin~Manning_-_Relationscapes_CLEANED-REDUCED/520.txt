Feelings are associated with facts in Whitehead’s philosophy, with creativity as their conduit. The quality of expression of an artwork is its feeling. Feelings for Whitehead effect the transition of a prehension into an event. The feeling of landscape that becomes the experience of Sandhills of Mina Mina (2002) is a feeling of what the Dreaming had “in mind.” “In mind” refers not to a stable subjectivity but to an ontogenetic in-gathering of forces that emanate from the work into the factness of the collective experience it provokes. When Napangardi says she always has her country “in mind” she is referring to a collective iteration— through Dreamings, dances, songs—that gives her in-mindness a resonance of country. The country is not “hers”—it creates her in a collective individuation that lends force to the creative gestures that are her works. This force taking form is the feeling of the work.
