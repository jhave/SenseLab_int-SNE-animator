The inertia Hester experiences in her frozen state is a topological implosion of perception without the causal relations that would connect her surroundings to an “elsewhere.” To connect (to) environments is to directly perceive the environment’s relation to our moving body. When implosion occurs—an inertia at the level of the infinitesimal—it becomes impossible to sense-with. There is no toward to which to relate. Frozen, encephalitis lethargica patients are in a constant, immanent state of sense implosion.
