The interval belongs to a certain qualifying vocabulary such as that expressed through Whitehead’s “eternal objects.” The interval is not a thing but a quality of light, speed, closeness, purpleness. In Whiteheadian terms, this means that the interval preexists all actual occasions, composing them but not perishing along with them (when they have become “satisfied”). While a prehension may create an actual occasion that in time will have served its purpose and disappear, the interval that incites that actual event to shape-shift will remain potentially active for the next preacceleration. The interval is eternal.
