To make the movement appear does not mean to restrict the movement to the parameters of the technology. It does not mean to delimit movement to gesture. We require operations that traverse the spectrum of the technology’s potential metastability in relation to a becoming-body. When technology begins to operate along this spectrum it forms an associated milieu with the interval that is the becoming-body. Technology not mapped-onto but emergent-with a body-becoming might make different durations felt along the stratum that is the sensing body in movement. This would happen first not at the level of reality but through the presentness of appearance. The technology would have to function not as a system that takes over the moving body but as a complex interface through which the technogenetic body can be moved to appear. The effect of this (dis)appearing body would eventually populate the nexus such that certain aspects of the technogenetic body could remain dormant, real yet virtual, embedded in a pastness accessible in the present through activation. There is no doubt this already happens—but still too rarely. Techniques for technogenetic emergence must become part of the technology’s interface: we must develop techniques that create new associated milieus never distinct from the ontogenetic body. Technological recomposition must no longer be inserted into a body-system: it must be emergent with it.
