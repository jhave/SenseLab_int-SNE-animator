The elastic point inflects the curve with an almost. This almost is the slight delay, almost imperceptible, that occurs at the interstice of the actual re-becoming virtual. The vortical force of the elasticity shapes the movement such that it becomes fully actual at the same time as it recomposes through microperceptual intensities virtually active in the interval. The elasticity of the almost is a rare instance of an almost-actualization of the microperceptual within the actual. In the elastic moment, the movement becomes more-than, enveloping in its folds all of the potential of its pastness and its futurity. This elastic becoming-actual is thus also a becoming-virtual, an inflection on the curvature of pure experience that demands that its effects be felt. In the elasticity of the almost, what is felt is the rhythmic sensation of the fullness of movement, movement beyond its actualization.
