It is not only the subject of Baggs’s video that is inventive but the process itself. Baggs’s video would not be as powerful were it simply a description of how her process moves through a prearticulation that makes concepts felt. The force of her video is the appetition it produces in the viewer to feel again, to think-with and know more. With more than 630,000 hits,124 In My Language has clearly struck a chord beyond the initial curiosity about autism. In My Language evokes a feeling for articulation that moves us, literally altering our place—the place of language—in the world. It foregrounds language not as a personal enunciation but as a collective event articulated through relational series. In Baggs’s video, prearticulation becomes preacceleration: the reaching-toward of expression as conceptual unfolding. We are moved to think.
