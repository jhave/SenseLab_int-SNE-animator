Transductions from path to force, these zones of encounter are intensities in the making. Salt on Mina Mina dances. It dances its trajectory, its story, it future-past passage into the present. Like all evocations of Dreamings (Jukurrpa), this painting refracts a sacred story. Napangardi’s work around Mina Mina tells the story of digging sticks, of women dancing, of a meeting place for spirit ancestors both human and animal. It is the story of a rhythmic pounding of the earth with digging-sticks emerging from the ground like moving trees. It is the story of ancestral women dancing the digging-sticks’ formation across the curved root systems of the yams and other ground vegetables. It is the story of dust rising in the wake of long flowing lines of earth dancing, of women moving through, weaving in, flying above. It is the story of a snake billowing up into the sky on a magic carpet of dust, almost unnoticed by the dancing women. It is the story told around a snake ancestor—Walyankarna—who rests today at Yaturlu Yaturlu (The Granites).
