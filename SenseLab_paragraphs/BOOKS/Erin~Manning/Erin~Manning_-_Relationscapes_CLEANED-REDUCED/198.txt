What we see in dance/new technology performances is often a prosthetically enhanced body where the prosthetic “makes the difference,” contributing technologically to the stage-space.45 The idea is that the prosthetic brings the body to a new level of sensation through movement. But this transformation tends to occur at the level of representation. We perceive a change in space (the image shifts), but do we feel space differently? The logic of the prosthesis as it is mobilized in this kind of dance trend rarely moves beyond the limits of interactivity.46 It does not move the relation: it foregrounds mediations between different systems whereby one portion of the system is necessarily preconstituted. In most cases this means working with a stable body-concept. From stable to unstable and back, but never really metastable. New ecologies of experience are rarely created under these conditions.
