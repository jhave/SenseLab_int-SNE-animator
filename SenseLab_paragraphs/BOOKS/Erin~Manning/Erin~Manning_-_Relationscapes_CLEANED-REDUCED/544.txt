Feeling the nexus means feeling the abstract concretely. The abstract and the concrete overlap in an eternal transvaluation of return. As Deleuze writes: “Returning is everything but everything is affirmed in a single moment” (1983, 72). This time paradox is only a paradox if we take becoming to emerge from being. The Dreaming makes no such claim. As is expressed through Napangardi’s work, Dreamings are not evocations of a particular space-time. Dreamings are rhythm, contrast, vibration. Dreaming narratives are singular expressions of networks of force taking form.
