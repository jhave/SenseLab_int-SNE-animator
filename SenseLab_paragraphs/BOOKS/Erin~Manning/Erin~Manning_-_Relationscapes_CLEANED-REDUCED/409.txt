The techniques of movement at work in Leni Riefenstahlâ€™s conception of the movement-image move from the biopolitical toward the biogram in the sense that they emerge in the interstices of a body-becoming from the question of what a body can do. They operate through forces that create. For Riefenstahl, it is not a question of the power of a particular body. The body emerges not fully formed but in relation to an associated milieu that is itself a body-becoming.
