The next series begins with a shift in the music from an orchestral ebullience to a more tentative, lighter score. The thrownness of the last series now merges with the sky, a structural point for the next series. This structural point actualizes the intensive shift from thrownness to swaying. On the intensive background of atmospheric potential, the mood changes. The quality of the movement shifts from a line of flight to a textural surface. The flute is predominant now, playfully interacting with the womenâ€™s bodies as they merge into one another, shots overlapping. Another multiple body begins to take form, an amalgamation of limbs becoming grass, becoming clouds, becoming atmosphere. The arms dissolve into sky, fading into the legs of a woman skipping, the movement appearing always as though in advance of the displacement it provokes. As with the throwing in the last series, preacceleration makes tangible the way in which total movement creates a body rather than simply representing one.
