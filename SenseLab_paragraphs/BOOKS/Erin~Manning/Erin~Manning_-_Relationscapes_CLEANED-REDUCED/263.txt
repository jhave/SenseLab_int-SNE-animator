This chapter looks at how plotting movement “actually there” but imperceptible to the eye was slowly transformed in Marey’s work toward the invocation and mapping of forces. As forces that could not be seen (but could be felt) emerged, instead of denouncing them as unviable for quantification, he created new techniques for their measurement. “How does a bird’s flight interact with the resistance of the air?” he might ask. The machine devised to inform his curiosity would answer this first question, only to propel him to explore further and inquire how force could be visualized. This desire to measure in turn expressed itself in a continual reworking of perceptual techniques. Machines that began as simple mechanisms for the study of a particular movement became instigators for creating new machinic processes to sense movement’s force. This compulsion to make the force of movement-passing appear would then propel the construction of yet another movement-sensitive machine. This fascination with the machinic processes of experimentation situates Marey’s research along an uncanny continuum between positivist analysis—the exploration of an object of study divorced from its environment, and what William James calls radical empiricism—a pragmatic investment in the relation between objects and worlds.
