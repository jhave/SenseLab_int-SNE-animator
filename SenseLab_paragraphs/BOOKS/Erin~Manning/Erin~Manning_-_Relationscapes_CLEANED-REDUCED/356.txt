In this first series, we encounter a body-experience more than a body as such. This body-experience is created through a thrownness that makes preacceleration felt. Each shot in the ball-javelin-discus series focuses on the act of throwing. From one throwing movement to the next, we feel the incipient force of movement moving. The camera moves not from body to body but from throwing to throwing. This repeated thrownness keeps a single body from individualizing. Bodies moving co-individuate with a world that becomes thrown.78 This force of becoming provokes an experiential shift that calls forth a becoming-multiple.
