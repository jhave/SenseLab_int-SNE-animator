Kngwarreye paints the reaching-toward out of which dancing dreams are composed. This reaching-toward is an almost-touch: it touches the not-yet through which futurity will emerge. Painting the untouchable is to preaccelerate the urgency of the taking-form these extraordinary paintings propose. This suggests a noncoincidence always present in the act of mark-making, a rhythmic disjunction that recalls the latency or the virtual in any actualization. To actualize in this sense is to make-present both the future and the past. Painting is creation.111 Kngwarreyeâ€™s art is not unconscious. What she paints is absolutely real, eventful, its untouchability always an incitation to touch.
