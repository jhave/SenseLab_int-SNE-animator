Folding undoes the finality of form. Form becomes a folding-into, a force-toward that is a threshold, a becoming-spiral, a becoming-turn, a becoming-triangle. These are forms-in-the-making, resonant only in relation to the movements they give rise to. Emergent forms are more than steps. They are porous steps—porous because unidentifiable as such (“What was that!” she will ask as the movement completes itself), yet felt. You will know that something happened, that your body became something, but the “what” of the step will rarely reveal itself as such.
