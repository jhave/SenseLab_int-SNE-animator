Karntakurlangu Jukurrpa (2000b) is held together by vertical dotted lines on its edges. These vertical lines call forth the intervals between the dots. As in all of Napangardi’s works, the becoming-lines focus the movement of the painting toward its incipience, causing vision to be held up by the tonality rather than by the content of the work. We look-with, across the becoming-form of the canvas, with an intensity that pulls the becoming-image from the inside-out, propulsing the white field of the canvas’s center toward the worlding it foretells. This one is a violent worlding, a movement that feels less like dancing than like a battle or a storm.
