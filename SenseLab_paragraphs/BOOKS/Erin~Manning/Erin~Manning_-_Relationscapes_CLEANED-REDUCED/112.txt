The elasticity of the almost is part of the curve. It is the curve’s point of inflection. “Inflection is . . . the elastic point” (Deleuze 1988a, 20). Inflection is the genetic element of the active line. It is not a hard point, nor is it a point directed from outside the movement. The elastic point is of the movement. It is that which culls from the movement’s potential its becoming-form. This singularity carries the curve, is the event of the curve. This singularity is what expresses the virtual fullness of the interval, its plenitude. This plenitude is the worlding of the movement. That interval is worlding does not mean that it contains the world, but that it potentially expresses the infradimensional, which is the worlding of pure plastic rhythm.
Inflection gives expression to this worlding, and in the elasticity of its activity, it makes palpable the tangibility of sensation. As the movement perishes, preaccelerating toward the next movement, the interval fills up with the potential still languishing in the pastness of the last movement. It is not that the new movement contains the specificity of the past movement—its steps. What the new movement contains are all of the micromovements, the potential elasticities of the past movement. Movemented tendencies. Virtual events.
