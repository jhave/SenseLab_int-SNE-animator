All Dreamings are sustained by multiple guardians. Members from different clans are Kirda and Kurdungurlu for the Dreaming,89 which means that while one person is responsible for the iconography of the Dreamingâ€™s location, another is responsible for parts of its story. An individual cannot single-handedly decide to paint a Dreaming, even if he or she is Kirda for that Dreaming. The Kurdungurlu must be included in the process: relation is already inscribed in the Dreaming before its story is told again. The same goes for the trajectories of the songs that populate and extend the space-time of the Dreamings. No one ever owns a complete trajectory. To sing the songs of a Dreaming, communities must be assembled, sometimes even intertribally. The Law is played out in this relationship of reciprocity. A sharing of the land is an experience of relation in its future-passing.
