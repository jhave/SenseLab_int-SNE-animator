“Small perceptions are as much the passage from one perception to another as they are components of each perception” (Deleuze 1993, 87; translation modified). Small perceptions are like what Arakawa and Madeline Gins call imaging landing sites: they qualitatively site perception beyond the register of perceptual actuality. They are virtual recomposings of the force of perception. They feel the world worlding, and they contribute to it, this contribution altering the dynamics at work in the relations they call forth. They regather perception, recomposing the body toward its appetite for seeing-with.
