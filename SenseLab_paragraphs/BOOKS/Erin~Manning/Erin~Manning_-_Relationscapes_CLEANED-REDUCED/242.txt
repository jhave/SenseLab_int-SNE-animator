Life is as complex as the actual events that compose it. These actual events are multiple, each of them composed of prehensions culled from the magnitude of pastness non-sensuously felt as the present passing. Non-sensuous perception is the activity of perceiving the tonality of pastness in the present. Nonsensuous perceptions shade the currency of futurity. Perception as the infolding of the potential for activation of the future-past is the relational nexus for lifein-the-making. Perception is not the taking-in of an object or a scene. It is the folding-with that catches the event in the making.
