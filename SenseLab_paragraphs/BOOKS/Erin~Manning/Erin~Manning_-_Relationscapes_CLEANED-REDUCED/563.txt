“Nothing happens without kinaesthetic instigation, corporeal proddings” (Arakawa and Gins 2002, 11). Watching Rosas danst Rosas is a moving-with that animates our capacity for landing. This does not happen solely through the visuals. The experience of watching-with Rosas danst Rosas is profoundly audiovisual, the sound of the score and of the breathing altering the rhythms of our perception. We feel the rhythm as it lands us.
It’s not that we’re trying to land. “A looming non-focused-upon area . . . gets continually supplied, or roughed in, or approximated, by imaging landing sites” (Arakawa and Gins 2002, 12). The landing sites are there for the experiencing. They virtually co-constitute experience as it forms. As bodies recombine with them, the experience becomes “generalized.” This means it becomes tainted with a quality, a feeling. Its affective tone resonates. It lands us. Suddenly we are no longer simply watching four bodies moving. We are feeling movement moving. We are moving-with our watching. Fielding the finding-form of microperceptibility, we move-with the movement even as we are moved by it.
