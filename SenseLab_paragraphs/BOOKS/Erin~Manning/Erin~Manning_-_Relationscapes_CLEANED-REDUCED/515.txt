What Whitehead would call their “fact of togetherness” is the nexus of the Karntakurlangu Dreaming. This nexus is populated by the various forms the iterations of the Dreaming take, from rain to salt to sand. Each painting dances the Dreaming, foregrounding an aspect of its fact. Seen this way, the “associated works” of Napangardi—the sandhills, the rain, the digging-sticks, the lakebed—find their fact of togetherness. They are divergent encounters with aspects of her Dreaming. Sandhills of Mina Mina (2002) is another of these allied iterations in the related fact of Napangardi’s Dreaming. It is not a derivation, but a conjunctive force in the dyad “Salt-Lines/Karntakurlangu.” In this painting—of which there are also many iterations, painted over a period from 2000 onward—Napangardi uses color on a black background, tones of red, blue, ochre with white.
