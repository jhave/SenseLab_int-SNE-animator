Take two more of Napangardi’s canvases, this time both titled Karntakurlangu Jukurrpa. Both paintings were made in 2000. One of them measures 137.5 x 152.5 cm—an imperfect square—the other 130 x 239.5 cm—an elongated rectangle. Karntakurlangu Jukurrpa (2000a) is the more colorful of the two—with ochre as well as black and white. The two paintings are very different, and yet that they express the same matter of fact can be felt. The “how” of their expression—the force of form they make felt—is how they relate on the shared nexus of the Karntakurlangu Dreaming.
