Napangardi creates events for creative advance. Her work gives power: “The will to power is essentially creative and giving: it does not aspire, it does not seek, it does not desire, above all, it does not desire power. It gives” (Deleuze 1983, 85). Napangardi’s paintings are plastic, variable, mobile iterations of the will to power that is the Dreaming in its infinity of variations. Hers are not general iterations: they are specific events, dated evocations, infinite reiterations of how the Dreaming’s will to power can extend beyond the continuum to the everyday, toward the conjunctive disjunction of the future-past. With her paintings, Napangardi creates new feelings for thought, new images for movement.
