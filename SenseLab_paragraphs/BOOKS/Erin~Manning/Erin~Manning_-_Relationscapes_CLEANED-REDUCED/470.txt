Land rights as painted by Clifford Possum are dimensions of experience. The folds of this experience are made-up of the rituals that call forth the Dreamings as events. Clifford Possum’s paintings are alive in their multi-dimensionality, not only as examples of “abstract” art that has “content” but as a rethinking of abstractness itself.
The space-times of experience created through Clifford Possum’s map paintings can be thought as a topological hyperspace of transformation. They create relays that are not simply geographic but also experiential, proprioceptive, where space and time fold into one another.102 Space here is performed, folding into durations that become part of the materiality of the painterly event. Be it the land “itself ” or acrylic, the point of the Dreaming is that it is not a location or a representation. It cannot “exist” in a Euclidean space-time, but must always move, resituating itself in relays that are changeable, depending on seasons and tribal conjunctions.
