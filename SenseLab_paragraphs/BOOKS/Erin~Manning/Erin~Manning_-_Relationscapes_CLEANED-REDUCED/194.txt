A dancer walks across the stage. She wears sensors on her arm. Behind her is a large screen. Connected wirelessly is a software program that orchestrates input and output according to a computational relationship between displacement and its convergence into sound and video. As she moves, the software generates a reaction in the environment. To be detected, the movement has to actualize. The movement must be registered by the program as a gesture-in-itself. It must become a displacement. Preacceleration cannot be detected by the software. An extensive movement is therefore necessary, usually a displacement either of a limb or of the whole body across space. Depending on the software, this movement triggers an image or recomposes a sound (slows it down, speeds it up, generates it). This usually happens in the “real time” of the dancer’s movement. The spectator is thus invited to participate in an intermedia experiment.
The challenge is how to keep the participant’s attention on the quality of the movement.
