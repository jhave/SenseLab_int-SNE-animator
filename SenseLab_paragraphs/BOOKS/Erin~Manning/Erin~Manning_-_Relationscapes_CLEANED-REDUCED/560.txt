Looking with Thierry de Mey’s looking with Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker’s Rosas dancing with Rosas is a nesting within nests of potential landing sites. The camera directs with de Keersmaeker’s choreographic directives, moving-with the bodies dancing. To choreograph becomes a double movement, a dancing-with the dancers dancing for the camera. The rhythmic intensity of the film depends on this double-movement that seeks not to order the movements as preliminary to the event, but to move-with their movement moving. The camera defines landing sites for perception, giving us hooks for our own process of landing.
