In presentational immediacy there is neither past nor future, which is why Whitehead stresses the need for the continual interfolding of causal efficacy and presentational immediacy. “The how of our present experience must conform to the what of the past in us” (Whitehead 1927, 57). Symbolic reference takes us back to the relation out of which a symbol is created. This return is “almost automatic but not quite . . . The imperative instinctive conformation to the influence of the environment has been modified” (Whitehead 1927, 66). Symbolic reference connects thought to experience, creating a field for auto-activation. “Such symbolism makes connected thought possible by expressing it, while at the same time it automatically directs action” (Whitehead 1927, 66).37 Symbolic reference brings relationality to the fore through direct, symbolically conditioned action akin to the taste of being awake coffee provokes.
