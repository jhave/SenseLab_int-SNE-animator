Greg Lynn defines animate form as the activity of force within movement’s animation, distinguishing it from the action of movement’s displacement. For Lynn, animate form “implies the evolution of a form and its shaping forces; it suggests animalism, animism, growth, actualisation, vitality, and virtuality” (1999, 9). The process of animating form involves working with the force of the incipiency of movement’s preacceleration rather than with the addition of movement to already-executed poses. Lynn uses naval design as an example, “where the abstract space of design is imbued with the properties of flow, turbulence, viscosity, and drag so that the form of a hull can be conceived in motion through water” (1999, 10). Animation is the how of movement’s potential to alter the force of form.
