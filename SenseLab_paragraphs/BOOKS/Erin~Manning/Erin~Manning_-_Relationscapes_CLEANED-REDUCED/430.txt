This is not an easy task. An animate sculpture is a dynamic form that remains dynamic. To do so, it must keep moving (without moving). How? By creating a relational environment. Similarly to Irwin’s Who’s Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue, whose vertigo of appearance gets people moving and talking, Spriggs’s work creates openings for engagement. What his work proposes is that we create a movement-with that fosters the emergence of animate form. This play with emergence is an inventive pact between art and participant. It proposes relation without telling us in advance how to move.
