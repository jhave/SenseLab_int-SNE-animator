It is a question of the curve. In Leibniz, the curvature of the universe expresses itself in three fundamental notions: the fluidity of matter, the elasticity of bodies, elasticity as mechanism. Matter springs into curvature. Matter does not in and of itself curve: it curves because force acts upon it. We would not curve to fill the hole if there were no one in our way. “But the universe is compressed by an active force that gives matter a curvilinear or vortical movement, following a curve without tangent” (Deleuze 1988a, 8). Beyond the tangent that expresses a straight line, there is a curve replete with microtornados that produce microperceptual intervals. A curve within a curve within a curve.
