Each event creates a different ground. Space-times of experience are always linked to shifts in ground. Ground is part of the technogenesis that makes events felt. Every appearance grounds differently. And every worlding is ontogenetic: it creates holes through which we dance, opening the way for movements that technogenetically invent worlds.
