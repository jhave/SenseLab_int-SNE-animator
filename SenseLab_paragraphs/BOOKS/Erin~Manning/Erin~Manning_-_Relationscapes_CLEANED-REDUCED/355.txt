Throughout Olympia, the protagonist is not the body as such but its atmospheric coming to life in relation to an always emergent environment. Think of the discus thrower: slowly, the camera circles, the body’s movements taking shape in the becoming-form of a spiral. The body isn’t yet moving—the earth is moving. As the spiral opens, the body begins to move, its preacceleration tearing flesh from stone. He moves, but only insofar as the whole image moves: what we experience is a pure movement (what José Gil calls a total movement77), a movement that qualitatively alters a body’s capacity to become.
The discus thrower moves the image, altering how body, flesh, and image interact. He provokes what we could call the first series of the film, the ball-javelindiscus series. Here as elsewhere, Riefenstahl does not foreground a particular Olympian body. She creates a mobile series that makes apparent how movement is infinitely more than its displacement, and how a body emerges from the incipience of movement moving. Bodies, for Riefenstahl, are what happens in the between of image and movement.
