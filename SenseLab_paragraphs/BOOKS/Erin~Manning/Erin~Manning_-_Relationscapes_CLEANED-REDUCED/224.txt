Digital technologies must work at the level of perceptual emergence. To do so, they must harness resources where they can. Technology has to become ontogenetic. By working ontogenetically—toward technogenetic emergence—rather than prosthetically, technology must become capable of actively making sense such that it creates new sensing bodies in movement. No longer held back by the limits of the software, movement might then be able to make the technological process appear rather than simply moving to its parameters.54 To add nuance to these experiential experiments, technology must also make its failures felt, its lagging behind, its system collapse, its loss of ground. Making the digital analog is not the goal: technogenesis becomes evocative when it works at the level of invention, when its techniques make transduction felt, foregrounding the metastability of all moving systems.
