Kngwarreye’s works are not simply visual events. They are physically overwhelming experiences that capture the passing of the material substrate into sensation. Sensation is not projected: movement is felt as the canvas becomes a point of departure in a vast network of alliances of which the human body is but one aspect. Metamorphoses of forces, exfoliations of experiences, these are what is at stake in Kngwarreye’s “whole lot.” The “whole lot” is not a subject. It is the plane of immanence, the combinations of speeds, of affects and percepts in which “the One expresses in a single and same sense all of the multiple, [where] Being expresses in a single and same sense all that differs” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 254). Kngwarreye’s paintings are topological hyperspaces, absolute surfaces where all nodal points are virtually copresent. They are transspatial, transmedia events where distances (of thought, of movement) defy the limits of physical space-time.
