David Spriggs’s works are wonders in movement. They make you move. This is the feeling of what happens: The glass box containing a work called Blood Nebulae (2002) stands before us. We look at the object to recognize its form as we move toward it in the gallery space. As with all objects, we tend toward a frontal view, giving in to the totality of appearance a frontal view usually provides. But the artwork doesn’t appear in the way we expected. Its red feels blurry, its edges shifty. Yet it’s there—we can feel it. Curious, we move around to the side. We find the becoming-form of the work moves with us. What we feel: the force of perception. This force moves us to look again. The object is appearing now, but its appearance doesn’t stabilize. We are moved to move again. Now we are looking from the side, where the hanging sheets of Mylar are exposed. The actualizing form eludes us again. Instead of the taking-form of the figure, we face the Mylar’s plastic texture undulating with the color of almost-form. We are fascinated with the sheets: they seem to be the (un)making of perception. We move again, moved by the process of art taking form.
