The Dreaming itself is a force taking form. Painting the dreaming is a regathering of forces of country for the experience of perception. Force works across strata here, from the contagion of the Dreaming as extensive continuum for Aboriginal culture as a whole to the expression of a singular instance of the force of form in the future-present experience of a painting. For Nietzsche, all things are evocations of a history of forces that struggle for iteration. As Deleuze explains: “The same object, the same phenomenon, changes sense depending on the force which appropriates it” (1983, 3). Force is appetition: hunger for expression. The appetition of an event is the insatiability of its potential. The shift from appetition to form is never a completed passage. In the work’s final form, the force of its potential can still be felt. This is the work’s diagram. The diagram of the work in-gathers the work’s feeling. Whitehead calls the final fact of the work the decision of emphasis. This is how the work satisfies its becoming. This satisfaction is the present-finality of its current iteration.
