For such technogenesis to take form, Whitehead’s distinction between appearance and reality must be taken into account. The appearance of a technogenetic body cannot be based on a body (an organic body, a dancing body) that preexists its emergence. The body must not be danced and then supplemented: it must dance its supplement.55 It must dance its novelty such that it introduces within the movement the mutability of the body’s rhizomatic networks of actuality and virtuality. We must never forget: a body is never wholly actual. It is always virtually what it will have become as it interweaves the organic and the technogenetic, where the organic is as much a technology of the senses as the senses are technologies of the organic.
