To take the next step is to move-with the interval produced by preacceleration, to feel-with the shape-shifting of smells encroaching, to hear-with the wall’s approach. This feeling-with is proprioceptive, immediately linked to our sense of balance, to our ability to space space. We don’t need to put our hands on the walls to feel them, or to touch the ground to know where it is. Touch crossed with vision and sound fields the environment, opening it to the relational multiplicity of movement, sensation, and space-time co-mingling. Even walking alone is replete with relation: we move-with the feeling of the ground as it expands toward the pelvis, giving into the weight of gravity’s pull, participating kinesthetically in the shifting dynamics of one leg grounding at a time. We move-with the edge of a room approaching or the horizon line receding. To take the next step is to move-with the world.
