As with all states of inertia, what is necessary is a force coming from elsewhere. In most of us, this “elsewhere” need not be initiated by someone else: it is embedded in habits of movement. It is important to distinguish here between the idea of willing movement (i.e., I want to move) and moving through habits of movement (i.e., moving through a future-pastness that is already welling in our capacity to move). Think of morning inertia. What gets you from your quasi-awake state out of bed? The thought of coffee likely gets you moving. Coffee propels you through the frozen state into auto-activation, stimulating something akin to the taste of being awake. You move without giving another thought to the challenge of taking the next step. Coffee’s on your mind.
