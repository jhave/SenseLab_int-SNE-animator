Animating movement is not restricted to drawing in McLaren’s work.76 For McLaren, sound plays an equally important role, often providing the rhythm for the moving intervals he draws. “For myself, indeed, with an abstract film the most pleasing forms are those which come closest to the music. There must be visual equivalence” (McLaren 2006). Begone Dull Care (McLaren 1949) works this way, its sound animating the surface of the film. In this eight-minute short, the music of the Oscar Peterson Trio carries the becoming-forms of the images shifting across frames, themselves folding into the musicality of the sound. The visual forms are resonances of color and line more than they are figures. In one particularly evocative section, the colorful screen shifts to black and white, the complex colors morphing into the simplicity of a line. It is as though the consistency of the image were reshaped by the quietening of the sound. The minimalism of the foregrounded line is felt as an animation of the music’s affective tonality. The line is perceived through the sound more than it is seen visually, shading into a dot, then reappearing as a line dancing with another line, melding into a musical singularity, then decomposing into the traces of its passing, the piano dancing its formation, the activity of the line appearing and dispersing over a black background with slight traces of color that momentarily dot the screen, only to disappear almost as soon as we’ve felt a change in tone.
