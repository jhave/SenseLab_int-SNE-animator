Marey’s deductions on air resistance in flight influenced Tatin’s aviatory experiments. In his 1876 paper entitled “Travaux du laboratoire de M. Marey” (Braun 1992), Tatin presented his most successful flying machine, which operated from the principle that the force of movement in flight is directly proportional to the force of resistance. Eventually, however, in the way of transmutation that took hold of each of Marey’s inventions, Tatin’s flying machines evolved beyond their originary concept (and the firm belief of Marey’s that flying machines would be close to birds in their form) and moved toward what Alphonse Pénand already knew: the best flying machines would not be big birds but aeroplanes.
