A map of the landscape that relies on x/y coordinates asks us to pre-spacetime ourselves within it. Turn your body this way, it suggests, face this direction. To read a Cartesian map is to ask a preformed body-concept to conform to its gridding. Topological space-time works otherwise. This is why Clifford Possum did not always render the Dreamings in a “geographically accurate” way. To even posit a concept such as the “geographically accurate,” we must already have had the experience of the x/y grids of the mapping of Euclidean space that takes for granted that our journeys begin and end in directions that can be recomposed in space and time. It supposes that a body never shape-shifts, that it always sees from the same perspective and within the same field of potential relations.
