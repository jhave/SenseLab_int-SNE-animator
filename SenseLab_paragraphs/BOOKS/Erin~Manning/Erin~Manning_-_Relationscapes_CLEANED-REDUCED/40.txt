In Umberto Boccioni’s terms, the first way of thinking movement might be termed “relative movement” and the second “absolute movement.” In the first instance, we participate in a hylomorphic quandary where form preexists matter.12 The matter—my body—enters into the form—the room. Both body and room are pregiven in this instance. The room defines the limits of my body’s potential. In the second instance of “absolute movement,” individuation occurs in intimate connection between the moving body and its atmospheric potential.
