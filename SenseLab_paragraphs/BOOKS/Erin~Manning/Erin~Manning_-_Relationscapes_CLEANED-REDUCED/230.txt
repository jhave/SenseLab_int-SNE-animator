Now, the system recomposes the room even as the dancer composes with the system. The coupling causes the room to shift, to move, to breathe. As this happens, the intensity of a shift in space-time is felt. This is felt not through the sound shifting as such but through a slight difference in affective tone. The room reverberates around its color, its sound-quality, its becoming-form. Now, the spectator feels a concern with the space. This concern provokes a new kind of attention: a perception of the tonality of the interval. A new composition begins to unfold, one that may be related to an ontogenetic shift in the participating body of the spectator. Technogenesis: two bodies recomposed at different durations in the sensing spectrum.
