Relationscapes are propositions for future thinking. Amanda Baggs activates one such proposition through the notion of a constant conversation: “It is about being in a constant conversation with every aspect of my environment.” A constant conversation is an untimely affair: it jumps from plane to plane, virtually participating on the plane of thought and prearticulation, becoming-actual through concept formation, finally emergent on the plane of composition of language’s articulation. This infinite conversation126 is enveloped by the terminus not of signification but of responsivity: “Far from being purposeless, the way that I move is an ongoing response to what is around me.” This responsivity creates an active environment, proposing an in-gathering of forces for expression that elicit not standard responses but the novelty of conceptual innovation. “If I [don’t] interact with a much more limited set of responses . . . they judge my existence, awareness, and personhood.” In My Language proposes “a way of thinking in its own right” that is affectively resonant, conceptually complex and inventive in its articulations. It calls forth a relationscape that pairs preacceleration with prearticulation, making felt the force of movement taking form.
