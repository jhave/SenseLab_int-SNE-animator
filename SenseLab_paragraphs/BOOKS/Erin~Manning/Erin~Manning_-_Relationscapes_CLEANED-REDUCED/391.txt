Take two scenes. The first is the one in Triumph of the Will mentioned earlier. This scene opens on the stone eagle of fascism, blending slowly into the swastika that is its base, and then reaching behind to the moody backgrounded sky. The orchestral sound builds and conjoins with a long shot that captures the dense straight lines of the standing soldiers choreographed expertly in the name of the fascist machine of organization. A wide central path is left open and down this path we watch as three bodies walk toward the flames, Hitler, Himmler, Hess.
