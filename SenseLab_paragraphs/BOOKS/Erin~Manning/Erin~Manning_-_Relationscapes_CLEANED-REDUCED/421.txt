Allied to Boccioni’s concept of dynamic form, David Spriggs’s animate sculptures seem to create force lines for the emergence of perception. Boccioni writes: “No one still believes that an object finishes off where another begins, or that there is anything around us which cannot be cut up and sectionalized by an arabesque of straight curves” (1970b, 61). An arabesque of straight curves might be a way to speak of the affective tonality of the bursts of red on the hanging Mylar of Blood Nebulae. Whereas the front view gives us a sense of how the nebulae might appear, seen from the side, the hanging Mylar proposes a redness for the perception itself of nebulae. Taking a tour of the artwork becomes a trajectory in the force field of perception’s animated exploration of vision’s edge.
