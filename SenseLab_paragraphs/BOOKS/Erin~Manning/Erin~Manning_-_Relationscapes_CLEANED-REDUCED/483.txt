But there is also a new component, emergent in the bottom left corner of the fifth panel, a mysterious slate blue, strangely discontinuous with most of the already apparent shades, yet co-constitutive of them. This blue seems to forecast the concrescence of the series, holding the event to itself even while it proposes its continuity elsewhere. Bringing futurity into the mix, the sixth panel seems to virtually contain all the other canvases, holding the series together even while exhausting it, the paintbrush squeezing out its last drops of color. In Whiteheadian terms, the subjective form has coalesced (concresced). The last panel is the event that composes the series even as it marks the beginning of its perishing. The hands say it all: white hands multiplied in the right bottom corner, letting the series go. There is no holding on to an event that is already passing. Having reached its culmination, the series makes use of the frenzied crescendo of this diagrammatic finale to foreground the active disjunction out of which a revirtualization of potential is born—felt, particularly, in the blue-grey island— that marks the opening for the next actual occasion to begin to take form. The painting begins and ends in one and the same (multiplicitous) gesture.
This is an energetic finale. Energetic is the word for these dancing lines, but an energy of composition, not transcendence. These paintings are of the world, in the world, and for the world. As with the first series—Utopia Panels (1996)
