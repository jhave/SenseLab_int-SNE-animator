Here and throughout the rest of the canvases, the white of the nonpainted canvas shows through, creating an inner connection between these divergent but connected pieces. The third panelâ€™s lines are again pinkish and the composition more staid, though now the unpainted space is clearly present on three sides, creating a sense of an inner diagram functioning through a layering of backgrounds and foregrounds, as though the white lines and the white background resonated together. This whiteness of the canvas showing through is on all the subsequent panels, though only on the inner top and bottom corners of the last one.
