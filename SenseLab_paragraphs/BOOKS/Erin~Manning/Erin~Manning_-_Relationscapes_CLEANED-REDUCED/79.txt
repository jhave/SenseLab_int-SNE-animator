When thinking a politics of movement, it is important to remember that repetition involves the intangible moment of transition between the virtual and the actual where preacceleration is in-formed by its potential becoming. This duration is always on the cusp of taking form: there is no “afterwards.” When movement has ensued in displacement, acceleration is re-intensified into preacceleration, and the interval is active once more, ready to in-form the next infra-individuation. In this regard, there is always simultaneity of movement, always an overlapping of actual, actualizing, virtual, and virtualizing movements. Divergent series—nexuses of actual occasions—converge.
