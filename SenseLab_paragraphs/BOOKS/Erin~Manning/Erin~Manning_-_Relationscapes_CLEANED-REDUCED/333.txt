McLaren draws movement such that it takes consistency not on the frame itself but across frames. Thus, movement is felt not in a pose but in its experiential taking form across time and space. Keeping such a complex process of animating alive involves creating different techniques for different animating scenarios. McLaren was very pliable in this regard, creating forms of animation that evoked the complexity of the kinds of movement he sought to create. Sometimes he drew directly on the film stock; sometimes he filmed the processual traits of a painting in progress; sometimes he filmed with stereoscopic techniques; sometimes he used an optical printer. Each of these and many other techniques were used to explore the consistency of the virtual interval—movement’s preacceleration—as it expressed itself through the experiment of the “how” of movement moving.
