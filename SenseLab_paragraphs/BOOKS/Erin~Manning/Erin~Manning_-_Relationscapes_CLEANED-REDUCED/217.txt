Now we find that the ground takes part in the creation of the becoming-form of dance (a curve, a spiral, an arabesque), that movement’s subjective form is always intrinsically related to a moving ground. The ground contributes to the dance as a form-finding element in the dancer’s shape-shifting process, operating not as a stable entity but as an active determinant in the process. The ground is a compositional aspect of a dancer’s movement, reconstituting the ways in which space-time potentializes the moving body and vice versa. The ground does not simply ground—it dances.
