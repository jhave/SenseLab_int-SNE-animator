The camera pans through a multitude of windows. It is raining. The rain lends an opacity to the surface of the windows as though coming from within. We perceive a space within a space within a space. We watch as a woman circles, sounding a movement that seems to precede her, the camera catching her from the front, from above, leaving her behind the windows, passing toward another room. Rain, a movement inside, above, dark, shades of blue-black. Rosas danst Rosas, the film that was shot thirteen years after the first performance of its danced choreography, is more than a film of a dance. It is a seeing-with of dance participating with the moving screen. It is the filming of sites landing, sites that are less place-formations than affective tonalities in the passage from movement to its taking form.
