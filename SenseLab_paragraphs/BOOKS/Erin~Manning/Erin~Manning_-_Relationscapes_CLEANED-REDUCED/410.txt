Riefenstahl’s politics are affective because of their insistence on making conjunctions at the level of the incipiency of the preformed. What is expressed through her work are the rhythmic pulsations of dynamic form: her images work liminally from the edges of concepts and forms, folding them beyond their limits. Riefenstahl’s aesthetic is a politics both dangerous and inventive, productive of the potential of the more-than that is palpable in the rhythmic planes of consistency biograms call forth.
