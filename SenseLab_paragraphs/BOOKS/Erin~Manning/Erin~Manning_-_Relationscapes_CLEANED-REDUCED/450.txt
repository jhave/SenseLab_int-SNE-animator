The cosmology of the Dreaming must be understood as both actual and virtual.93 It is an overlapping of the two, where reality and dream are not opposed but superimposed. Aborigines of the Central Desert animate time in space. In their rituals, the present is ancestralized not as a nostalgia for the past but as a becoming-future. The past and the future, the actual and the virtual are traces of becoming whose dimensions are experienced in shifting continuity, as through the spiral of a Nietzschean eternal recurrence. When time is activated in this way what emerges is a timeline that is not linear. The present is always in the mode of an embodying withness not of a forgotten past but of a reexperiencing in the future-present.
