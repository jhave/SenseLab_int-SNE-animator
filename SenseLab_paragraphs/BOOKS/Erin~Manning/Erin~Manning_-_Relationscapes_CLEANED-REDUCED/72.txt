Tango is a walking dance. In a liquid embrace we move together, counterclockwise around a crowded dance floor. Floorcraft is key to the experience of the movement we seek. If the room moves with us, we feel as though we are dancing not with one other person, but with a hundred people. In this case, we experience a simultaneity of intervals: many rhythms and durations, one cadence. Repetition is another word for magic. One foot in front of another what we repeat is not the walk as such but the creation of intervals to the refrain of a simultaneous becoming. I move to move with you to move with them to move you moving me. Bodies recompose along new vectors, and the organs disperse. The connected intervals affectively transform our collective relation: the music moves with us, our collective steps sounding like a beating of a marked continuity. Boccioniâ€™s continuity in space. And yet these movements are improvised. Continuity in space becomes continuous discontinuity. The interval is always more than one, beyond the actual occasion.
