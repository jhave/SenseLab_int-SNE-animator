When we are speaking of movement, we must remember: the virtual and the actual are aspects of the same event (there is no actual without the virtual, and vice versa). What takes form as we move is the actualization of virtual potential rich in each displacement. The eventness of movement is a virtually concretized differentiation of matter-form that creates a dynamics that is of the order of speed itself. “You can . . . move with tremendous acceleration provided you know where you leave the movement—not where you put the movement, but where you leave it. You try to divest your body of movement, as opposed to thinking that you are producing movement” (Forsythe 1995, 1). Speed is preacceleration virtually prolonged, always already evading actualization. Absolute speed: magnitude of acceleration, qualitative transformation. When speed actualizes (quantifies), it slows down. Divesting movement of displacement, preacceleration becomes palpable. Evaporation, exfoliation, dissolution. “Movement is a factor of the fact that you are actually evaporating” (Forsythe 1995, 1).
We never evaporate alone. To posit this is to succumb to what Whitehead calls “the fallacy of misplaced concreteness” (1938, 18). The concrete must remain potentially virtual: its process of relationality must never be completed. The interval is a way of conceptualizing the concreteness of movement where the concrete remains relational and the movement remains virtual.
