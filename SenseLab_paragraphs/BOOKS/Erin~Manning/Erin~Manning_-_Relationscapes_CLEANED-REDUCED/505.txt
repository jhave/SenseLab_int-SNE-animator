The dotted lines in Salt on Mina Mina would not vibrate were it not for the gridding that holds together the painting’s background. The incipient force of the work is felt through the contrast between the white dots and the black background, and between the gridded lines and the not quite meeting of the lines in the foreground. One area of the canvas makes this particularly apparent: toward the center on the right-hand side, a set of dotted lines squiggle, momentarily undoing the linear progression of the movement of the lines toward the white almost-square of the painting’s calm middle. This curvature on a canvas otherwise composed of mostly straight lines gathers our attention to other deviations from the line, to the ways in which the lines in fact resist meeting, to the movements of curvature within each becoming-line. Through the contrast between foregrounded curvature and backgrounded grid, a movement takes form that resonates as a vibration more than as a displacement. It is as though we were moving and staying in place at the same time. This is how Djon Mundine describes Aboriginal dance: “Women move in a kind of minimalistic shuffle (not really a step) with the feet always in the sand” (2002, 68).
