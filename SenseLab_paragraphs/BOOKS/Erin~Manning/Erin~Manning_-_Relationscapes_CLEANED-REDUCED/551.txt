The falling sequence shown here is what first captures this quality of ground. This image of falling repeats twice in quick succession. In this series of images of falling, the camera becomes the protagonist of the action. The camera directs us. It provides the rhythms of the movements unfolding. This is emphasized again in a memorable sequence that follows: the four women lying down on their stomachs rise and fall, their upper torsos leading the movement. The camera works with the tensile activity of the dancers’ minimal gestures, moving now to one side as though filming four bodies in one, moving again as one body rolls, the breath in contra-rhythm with the bodies folding. As quickly as they fell, now the bodies pause, holding their form as the camera waits with them, suspending our attention in tandem with the suspended bodies. Our watching merges with the weight of the women’s heads moving slowly in an almost-reaching of the ground’s surface. The wait is almost unbearable, the camera heavy in its quietude. And then the dancers move again, their past suspension underscored by the camera’s focus on their backs arching, their heads still heavy but held.
