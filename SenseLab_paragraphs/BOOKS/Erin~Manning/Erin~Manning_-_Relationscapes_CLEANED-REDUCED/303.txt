The question of how numbers number is central to Marey’s experimentation. On the one hand, his process is one of counting as a collection of units. Each movement is mapped so as to be identical (in time and space) to the preceding one. What is measured is not the intensity of the flow but its calculated significance as located on a grid that maps space-time as preexistent. Interesting information can result from such measuring, such as the fact that at one point in time during the gallop, all four of the horse’s legs are off the ground, or that in a bird’s flight the resistance of air plays a key role.
