David Spriggs’s animate sculptures are experiments with the concreteness of abstraction. Their intensity is felt through the very evanescence of their almost-form passing into multiplicity, a concreteness allied always with mutations that are abstract, almost-there for vision, but not quite perceivable. This paradoxical relation between the abstract and the concrete, between the virtual and the material, between the perceptible and the imperceptible, is at stake in each of Spriggs’s animate sculptures. The theory-in-movement of the work: abstraction is what makes them concrete. As concrete as a vision. Robert Irwin suggests we call this movement toward the concrete “the process of a complexifying abstraction” (1998, 33; my translation). In an attempt to formalize a vocabulary for the passage from art to thought, Irwin wonders about the process that allows perceptions/conceptions to take on a meaning entirely independent from their origins (1998, 33). He writes: “To try to construct [a model for perception] is at once complicated and theoretical, and the passage that follows must be as much a procedure or a set of procedures as an explanatory system. Concrete is as concrete doesn’t”84 (Irwin 1998, 35; my translation).
