The event is as much vibration as action. It never fully actualizes, since the actual is always replete with the virtual. The fullness of virtuality within the movement gives it complexity. Without this, the movement would simply be a displacement, a falling into step. The event of movement moving is a quasi-virtual experience: actual because all steps actually take place, virtual because all the microperceptions of pastness and futurity are enveloped in the becoming-movement.
