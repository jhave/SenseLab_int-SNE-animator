Albert North Whiteheadâ€™s concept of actual occasions is central to understanding the spacedness and timedness of events throughout Relationscapes. As Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari emphasize by dating each of the plateaus in A Thousand Plateaus, events take form in the concreteness of time and space. This does not mean that time and space precede them. Quite the contrary: events create time and space. Whitehead demonstrates this by foregrounding the eventness of perception. For him, events of perception are always called forth through prehensions, which are the pulling out of expression from the durational plane of experience.7 When a becoming-event is pulled out, the activity of perception is experienced as such. This initial prehension creates the parameters for the taking-form of space-time in the context of a discrete experience.
