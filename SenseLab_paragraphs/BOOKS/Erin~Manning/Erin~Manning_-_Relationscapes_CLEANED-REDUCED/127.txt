This new movement will be virtually populated with the pastness that constitutes the experience of moving in that way. In relational movement, once I know that it is possible for my body to move a certain way, it is much more likely I will experiment with that way of moving. Whitehead calls these “non-beings of immediacy” that populate this feeling of knowing in relational movement stubborn facts. They are stubborn because we are never completely free of them. They tense up our shoulders, lock our knees. But they also teach us techniques that open up possibilities for movement that in turn become emergent potentialities, proposing entries into otherwise impossibly small holes, inviting us to move-with in ways which even yesterday we wouldn’t have imagined possible.
