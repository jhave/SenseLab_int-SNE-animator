From the very first shot, as the camera breathes movement into stone, it plays with the dynamics of appearance. This is reminiscent of an earlier scene in Triumph of the Will (1935) where Riefenstahl films the approach of Hitler, Himmler, and Hess. As we watch the three figures moving toward us, the camera pans from behind large columns, repeatedly blocking our view. The paradox of this technique is that the momentary and repeated obfuscation of Hitler, Himmler, and Hessâ€™s physical presence has the uncanny effect of intensifying the event of their arrival. We feel the virtual force of their importance through the disappearance of their actual bodies. A similar effect is produced in the first scene of Olympia as the camera approaches the Parthenon.
