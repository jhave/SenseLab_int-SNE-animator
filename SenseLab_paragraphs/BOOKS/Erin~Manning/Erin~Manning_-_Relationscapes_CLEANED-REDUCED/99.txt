Either way, what occurs is a qualitative reshaping of a force. Taking form through the preacceleration of the movement, and sustained by the movement itself, the interval folds into an intensive expansion, or an expansive intensity, languidly “holding” the movement. This holding is not structural: it is elastic. It is almost the next movement, almost the next axis, almost the next equilibrium, but not quite yet. This elasticity of the almost is the intensive extension of the movement, a moment when anything can happen, when our bodies are poised in a togetherness beginning to take shape. The next movement has not yet come, the past movement is passing. No step has been taken, and yet in this elastic the microperception of every possible step can almost be felt.
