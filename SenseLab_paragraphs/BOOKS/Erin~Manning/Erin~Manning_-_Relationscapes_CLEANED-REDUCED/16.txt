Incipient movement preaccelerates a body toward its becoming. The body becomes through forces of recombination that compose its potential directionalities. When I take a step, how the step moves me is key to where I can go. Gravity acts on the step such that the time span of the step’s creativity is relatively short-lived. Nonetheless, there is an incipient potentiality even here, where the step can move eventfully in a withness of movement moving that exceeds the predomination of the ground: the step can become a spiral. Preaccelerated, what is felt is neither stepness nor spiralness. What is felt is incipient potential to move-with the intensity of extension. Moving-with the intensity of extension means that movement gathers first in the potential of its incipiency, not in the extensity of its displacement. By the time movement displaces, few options for surprise remain: gravity’s pull over the movement’s directionality has taken over.
The dynamic form of a movement is its incipient potential. Bodies are dynamic expressions of movement in its incipiency. They have not yet converged into final form. Throughout Relationscapes, I refer to bodies as pure plastic rhythm. I propose that we move toward a notion of a becoming-body that is a sensing body in movement,6 a body that resists predefinition in terms of subjectivity or identity, a body that is involved in a reciprocal reaching-toward that in-gathers the world even as it worlds.
