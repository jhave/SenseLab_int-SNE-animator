The body-room series opens the way for thinking the “pure plastic rhythm” of bodies. For Boccioni, “pure plastic rhythm” is not “the construction of bodies, but the construction of the action of bodies” (1964, 48). In his work, Boccioni is concerned with sculpting the body, not as an immobile body that is modeled as though it were in motion, but as a body in movement. To sculpt movement is to prolong a spiral potential that is already inherent to matter. This prolongation of the spiral is what Boccioni calls dynamism, or dynamic form. Pure plastic rhythm is dynamic form in potentia. In a Spinozean gesture, Boccioni seeks to create a movement that is preaccelerated, a movement that never stops, yet has not come to full expression through displacement. That a body moves without displacing itself means that rest becomes an instance of absolute movement. Rest becomes an activity of rhythm. Boccioni calls this continuity in space. Continuity in space does not imply a static concept of space with a moving body transposed into its interior. For Boccioni, space moves. What Boccioni (with the other Futurists) seeks is a simultaneity of form and content where the virtual (preacceleration) is felt as creating a simultaneity of body and environment. Preacceleration forces movement to take form: “By its centrifugal direction, the form-force is the potential of the living form” (Boccioni 1964, 48). Force taking form.
