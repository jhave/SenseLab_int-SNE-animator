What is real and what appears exist in a complex network of movement moving. How movement moves is relational. When we move the relation, we never begin with a gesture. We move into gesture. What a body can do is characterized by its capacity to make sense beyond a vocabulary of the already-there. An ontogenetic body has an infinite potential for technogenesis. New technologies must dance to pure plastic rhythm.
