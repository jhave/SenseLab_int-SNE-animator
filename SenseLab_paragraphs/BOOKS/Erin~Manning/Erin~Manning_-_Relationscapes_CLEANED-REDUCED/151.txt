To be conscious of movement is to have known that movement moved you. Movement felt is available to consciousness only in terms of how it was left behind as a trace for the next movement moving. We are conscious of our lower back pain, not in terms of how we pass through posture, but in terms of how that pain incites us to invent new ways of moving. We are conscious of how that pain keeps us from moving solely out of habit.
“Consciousness flickers, and even at its brightest, there is a small focal region of clear illumination, and a large penumbral region of experience which tells of intense experience in dim apprehension” (Whitehead 1929/1978, 267). To have known what it felt like to feel pain is not the same as to have known how it altered our movement moving. The recombinations are infinite. We now move with new composite tendencies that realign the taking form of the moving body. Consciousness is of the pain, and of the lack of pain. Consciousness is how the irradiation of experience gathers itself into a final form. This final form is not the experience as a whole. It is what Whitehead calls the acme of emphasis.
