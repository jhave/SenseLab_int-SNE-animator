In chapter 6, I extrapolate from this notion of the diagram toward the concept of the biogram, as proposed by Brian Massumi in “Strange Horizon.”9 I define the biogram as that which propels a becoming-body. This force of becoming is a reconvergence of affective tonalities that transpire into a form that is itself continually mutating. Whereas a diagram makes felt the force of a painting, the biogram propels a moving-with of the ontogenetic body.
