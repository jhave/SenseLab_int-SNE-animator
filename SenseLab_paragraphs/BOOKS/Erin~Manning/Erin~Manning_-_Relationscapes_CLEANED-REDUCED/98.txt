The language of tango—out of which this particular version of relational movement finds its consistency—identifies this centrifugal spiraling as a colgada—a hanging spiral—the interval wider at the top while our feet stay together, our centers still facing one another. Intervals are not stable. Relational movement insists on morphogenesis. I may lead you into a colgada, a hanging-out, which creates a triangular interval, closed where our feet touch, opening upward and out, or, as we hang outward together in a colgada, we may reverse it into a leaning-in, a triangular form that opens downward into an intensive ground— a volcada, centripetal.
