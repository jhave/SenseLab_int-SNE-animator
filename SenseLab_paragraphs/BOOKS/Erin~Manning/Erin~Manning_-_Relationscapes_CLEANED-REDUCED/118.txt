“The world is the infinite curve that touches in an infinity of points an infinity of curves, a curve with a single variable, the convergent series of all series” (Deleuze 1988a, 34). The elastic point is eventful. It makes felt the lingering of actuality as it begins to fold back into the virtual, preaccelerating into the next becoming-movement. This lingering is part of the walk, part of its constraint— back, front, side. The infinite potential in three directions makes itself felt in the elasticity of the almost, but is as present in all of movement’s stages. To improvise is to be able to pull incipient movement out of the directions, to create the elastic out of the line (that itself becomes elastic), to redirect force, and move with it. To create an event.
