Boccioni does not seek a representation of movement. He creates movement. To create movement is not to sculpt movement’s illusion. It is to make movement felt in the recreation of new body-world series. This sculptural ambition is political. Through it, the political achieves a thickness, a volume. The immobile silhouette of the stable subject is usurped by a recomposing body that “seeks complete fusion of environment and object by means of the interpenetration of planes” (Boccioni 1964, 49). Gesture becomes dynamic: there are not two legs moving, but twenty. It’s all about rhythm: “Rhythm appears, not only dependent on the velocity, fastness, and linear measurement of an extensive movement, but also on the intensive capacity of the body, on its passage between direct potential states and its affective relations to the states of other bodies” (Portanova 2005, 34).
