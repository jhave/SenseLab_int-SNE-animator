Dorothy Napangardi’s Salt on Mina Mina (2001) measures 244 x 168 cm. Stately, Salt on Mina Mina (2001) moves with an intensity of quietude across a tall, vertical rectangle. The maze of dotted pathways at first evokes a grid. Lines of force make forays into conjunctive patterns only to deviate at the very moment of encounter. As with each of Napangardi’s evocations of the salt lines at Mina Mina, the dotted lines ultimately defy the grid, finding passageways more or less straight across the teeming array of activity, forming intensive zones on the canvas where a dance of meeting-points creates a background for the almost-meeting of the dotted lines in the foreground. The backgrounded lines of the grid make way for the intensive zones of the foregrounded force-field that ultimately make the work resonate. These are zones of intensive magnitude where a reaching-toward alters the composition of the work-as-grid.
