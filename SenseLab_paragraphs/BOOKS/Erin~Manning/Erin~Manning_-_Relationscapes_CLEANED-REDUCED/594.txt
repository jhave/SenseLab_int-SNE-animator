For Whitehead, feeling is the pulsion that transduces thoughts into becoming-concepts. On the plane of feeling, there are both determinations and appetitions. When a thought takes form, it moves from indetermination toward terminal determination. A feeling’s determination is the form it takes as a concept. In spoken language, a concept is always more-than: it holds in reserve the virtual potential of thought-taking-form that words by themselves cannot quite articulate. This indetermination is the concept’s appetition: its inherent potential for future invention.
