Despite his concern that the senses “often conceal the essential [and] lead to mistakes,” Marey’s final experiment captures sensation in the making. As always, his interest in the amplitude, force, duration and regularity of the shape of movement lead the way toward new techniques for the foregrounding of the otherwise imperceptible. The whole of his work until then had been concerned with showing how forces could be deduced by a movement-curve in order to relay back to the visible the trace that is imperceptible of movement taking form. In this 1901 series the turbulence of preacceleration is most resplendent. In these images, moving-through shifts from extensive to intensive passage. These are among the most graceful images, where movement-through feels like movement-with. The smoke and the object dance together, creating an gaseous plane of consistency. Particularly beautiful is an image where what looks like an oblong object has been moved-through the smoke-lines, leaving an undulating braid in its passage, calm and curvilinear at once.
