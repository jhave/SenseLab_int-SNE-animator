Smoothness does not carry within itself the possibility for change. When perception works, smooth space is “constantly being translated, transversed into a striated space; striated space is constantly being reversed, returned to a smooth space” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 474). When it doesn’t, as with Frances D., only the feeling of smoothness remains. This feeling is associated with “an amorphous, nonformal space” that “one occupies without counting,” a space without break or module, “an intensive rather than extensive space, one of distances, not of measures and properties” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 477–479).
