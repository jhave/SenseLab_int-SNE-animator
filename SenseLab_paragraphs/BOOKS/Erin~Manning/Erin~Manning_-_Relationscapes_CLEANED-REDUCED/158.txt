In Hester’s early years of post-encephalitic syndrome, she could be brought out of her inertia by “the merest touch . . . which served to dissipate these states, and to permit immediate resumption of movement and speech” (Sacks 1990, 95–96). At this stage in her disease, her inertia was in line with an extreme form of what most people experience at one time or another. All bodies tend toward a certain degree of inertia: it is not uncommon to find ourselves dazed by a television screen. Or to find it difficult to “snap out” of a daydream or get out of bed in the morning.30 The difference between Hester’s case and ours is the movement’s ability to auto-activate change. Auto-activation—the habitual capacity to change direction, speed, state—is something we generally take for granted. Able-bodied people tend not to question their ability to take the next step.
