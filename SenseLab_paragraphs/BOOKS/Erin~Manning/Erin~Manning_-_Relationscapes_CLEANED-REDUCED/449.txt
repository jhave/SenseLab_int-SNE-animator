Associated with the Dreaming is a certain birthright. In Aboriginal Central Desert society, you are born where the Dream enters you. To be born in Warlpiri is “palkajarri”—“becoming body.”91 A virtuality actualizes itself in the birth, a virtuality that is crystallized through a verse of a song that will be sung for generations to come. This song will “belong” to the becoming-body in the form of a Dreaming for which he or she will remain Kirda. To become-body is to materialize as song, as Dream, as rhythm.92 It is not to materialize individually but to be sung again, to become as a multiple body of communal experience. “Warlpiri philosophy does not oppose images to the substance or the essence of things. The two are indissociable” (Glowczewski 1989, 212).
