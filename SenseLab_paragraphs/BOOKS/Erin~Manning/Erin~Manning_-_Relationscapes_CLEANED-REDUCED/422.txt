Let me explain: what we see when we look is the emergence of contour from an interplay of edges. We don’t actually see an image—the image composes itself through the force of a relational dynamic. All vision works this way, our eyes at any given moment proposing nothing close to final form. What we experience as final form is in fact an appearance of the composed relation across moments. We see this composition, and even as we see it, it recomposes. Blinking, readjusting for saccadic bursts, reorganizing for stereoscopic vision, our field of perception is a play of movement yielding rhythmic contours. Stability is vision’s illusion. The challenge is de-animation, not the contrary.
This paradox of vision is made palpable in David Spriggs’s work. Think of Paradox of Power (2007). The paradox here is not the idea of the bull per se (and what the multiple bulls might represent) but the way the bull comes into vision. Let’s begin with a side-view: what we see is compelling—a strange permutation of red through blue. Looking again, we find we cannot really differentiate the blue, the red, the light seeping through, the plastic hanging, the edges of the glass box. It’s as though we see each of these qualities in their very emergence, caught in a prearticulation of the image. Blue is blue-on-blue, red is red-on-redon-blue, colors intermixing at the edges of our vision, their inmixing singular, our perception of them continuously shifting through the amodal experience of seeing-feeling the rhythmic contours of the almost-image. We cannot quite bear this view—it pulls us toward another angle, toward the image itself as it comes to expression. We’ve moved again.
