When duration makes itself felt, a hesitation occurs whereby we perceive the fluid force of the world’s becoming. Whitehead calls this force of feeling presentational immediacy. This perceptual experience is a relational movement that worlds even as it culls from its worlding the qualities and effects of this dynamic process. Presentational immediacy is perceptually felt duration. What is felt is movement’s lingering, its hesitation. This is what we actively perceive in Marey’s smoke-filled images: the strange, ethereal passings-through, foggy expressions of movement’s potential to linger.
