Perception folds in an infinite play of foregrounding and backgrounding. Eternal objects are nodes of relation for this elastic process of pulling in and out of experience’s continuum. Perception moves-with these openings toward changes in nature occasioned by “minuscule folds that are endlessly unfurling and bending on the edges of juxtaposed areas, like a mist or fog that makes their surface sparkle, at speeds that no one of our thresholds of consciousness could sustain in a normal state” (Deleuze 1993, 93). Unfolding is never the opposite of folding. Unfolding is intensive movement. Perception is the activity of making this intensity felt in the taking-form of worlding.
