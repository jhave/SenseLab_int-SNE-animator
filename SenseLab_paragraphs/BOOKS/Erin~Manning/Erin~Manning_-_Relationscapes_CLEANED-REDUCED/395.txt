There is a tension here and elsewhere in Riefenstahl’s films between the Godinfused transcendence of the fascist era—which is an opening onto an idea of a body beyond all bodies—and the physical transcendence proposed by Boccioni—the incorporeal body-becoming. While the Hitlerian transcendence seems to take hold through the filming of the large choreographed compositions, forcing a continual recasting of the plane of consistency into a plane of organization, thereby combining transcendence with disciplinarity, a resolutely physical transcendence also operates in Riefenstahl’s work, dominant by the time she makes Olympia. In Olympia, rather than moving between the choreographed disciplined body to the overbody of the decisively non-Nietzschean superman, the biogrammatic plane of consistency for the most part shifts toward a transcendence that excites or expands matter rather than reorganizing it into an immanent disciplinarity. And yet these two tendencies do sometimes overlap in her films, generating a complex intertwinement of her work with the Aryan superbody ideology of the fascist regime.
