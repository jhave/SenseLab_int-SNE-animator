Marey does not immediately arrive at “drawing vision drawing.” Early experiments show a more restrained experimentation. “Study of a Man’s Walk with a White Rod along His Spinal Column (1886)” is an example of an experiment that does not go beyond displacement’s representation. In this experiment, Marey backgrounds the human body such that the vertical lines of regular, cadenced intervals of movement’s displacement in the walk are foregrounded. He does this by placing a white rod at the body’s back to foreground the movement of that one area. This experiment results in a series of vertical lines organized in an equal cadence, emphasizing that walk’s displacement. The representation that results can easily be plotted onto a graph, but movement’s preacceleration cannot be felt.
