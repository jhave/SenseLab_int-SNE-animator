Relation in its incipiency is a field of force. This force acts causally on the sensing body in movement, dispersing its inertia. Relation is causal in the sense that it preempts a connection. Hester cannot walk in a “smooth” open space because there is nothing to preempt auto-activation. But when there is a boulder in front of her, she can climb over it. This is because the boulder striates the otherwise open or smooth space, provoking auto-activation by bringing space-time into focus. The boulder makes the injunction to move felt in a way that open space cannot.
