For four minutes, we become transfixed by the movements of Baggs’s hands, always in rhythm with a slightly modulated tonal singing. What begins as a voice becomes singing hands that roam through the space, creating the atmosphere in their passing. Flighty, these hands explore the movement of a string against metal—a rasping sound—shifting then from the string to the infinity of textures that populate the room: from string to surface to computer bag, the hands play the space. This playing transforms the space into an ambient musical instrument that moves in a dance of rhythmical becomings, Baggs’s object-instruments participating in a becoming-environmental of sound, her voice always in tandem with the becoming-textural of space. Object-voice sonorities are created in tandem with the discovery of the environment’s layers of experiential potential. As an accompaniment to Baggs’s slow dance of feeling, we experience the space-time of the becoming-environment’s dense affective tone. The shots are long and languid, their slowness rich with the eventfulness of sensation-in-the-making.
