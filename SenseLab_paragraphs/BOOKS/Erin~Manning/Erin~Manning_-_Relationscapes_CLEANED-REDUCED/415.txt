Riefenstahl works with the immanence of movement, biogrammatically rendering apparent time within movement. From within this process of making duration felt, she releases rhythm, actively pulling force out of the incipiency of movement, inciting it to appear. Through her play of appearance/disappearance, Riefenstahl creates a time-image of the movement-image, resolutely impregnating one with the other, creating superimposed, heterogeneous, divergent series that operate in polyrhythmic continuity within the same continuous movement. Every movement-with occurs durationally. In Whiteheadian terms, what Riefenstahl does is make time of the order of appearance without backgrounding movement.
