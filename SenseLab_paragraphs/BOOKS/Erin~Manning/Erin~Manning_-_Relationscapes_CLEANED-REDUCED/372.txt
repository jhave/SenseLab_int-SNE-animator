Biogrammatic movement in Riefenstahl is a thrownness felt as the preacceleration of a body-becoming. Alive in the virtual nodes of the between that composes the images as series, the biogram functions like the persistence of vision in the unaccountable shift from force to form. It makes the interval felt. “On account of the persistency of an image upon the retina, moving objects constantly multiply themselves; their form changes like rapid vibrations, in their mad career” (Boccioni 1970a, 27–28). The mad career of Riefenstahl’s art is its incitement to transduce, to become-across in a shattering of the absoluteness of the frame.
