Rhythm is active in the associated milieu of this quasi chaos. It is not rhythm added onto measure but relational movement in its incipiency. Associated milieus are vibratory with states of becoming. “Every milieu is coded, a code being defined by periodic repetition; but each code is in a perpetual state of transcoding or transduction” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 313). Rhythm passes through, qualitatively altering the milieus it creates that, in turn, generate it. “Transcoding or transduction is the manner in which one milieu serves as the basis for another, or conversely is established atop another milieu, dissipates in it or is constituted in it” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 313). The early image of the man-rod walking imposes measure onto movement. The movement is territorialized into coordinates that tend to close down its operations. The constraints of the walk—one foot on the ground at all times—become coded in a regularized space-time, which closes down all potential for the walk to evolve beyond its initial normative constraint. The resulting perception of the image is a perception of movement rather than a perception in movement. In the later image of the walking undulation, the walking transduces into curvilinearity, producing an associated milieu of body-movement-environment. Here perception participates in the quasi chaos of preacceleration. The associated milieu of preacceleration vibrates with the potential of polyrhythmicality. The walk as such is not transformed, it is what is emphasized that is different. This time the walk is more than a regularization of coordinates. It is a line of force, an elastic pulling and pushing through movement’s intensive magnitudes. What is felt in this second image are the microperceptions at work in the event of moving through movement. Vision suddenly sees more than the walk it has come to expect through visual representations. It sees the expression of movement’s curvilinearity.
