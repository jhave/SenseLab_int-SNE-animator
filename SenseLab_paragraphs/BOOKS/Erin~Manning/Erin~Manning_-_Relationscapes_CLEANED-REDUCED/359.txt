Series shape Riefenstahl’s work, giving force not to individual shots but to multiplicities evoked across and in the between of shots. We watch not from shot to shot but from event to event.79 The event of the second series is how the woman becomes earth becomes sky, moving in relation with an atmospheric becoming of nature. Watching her, we feel the delirium of another spiral emerging. As elsewhere in Riefenstahl, the creation of series opens the image to the transduction from immanent movement to the physical transcendental, where the physical connotes not how the image is represented but how it takes form in tandem with the shape-shifting of time and space. This shape-shifting is felt largely through the affective tonality—the atmospheric lightness, in this case—of the series. Affective tonality is key to how the series develop alongside the “content” of the film, allowing the film to take shape on multiple levels at once. Even as the shots glean their shape from images of the young, beautiful, strong Olympian body, what emerges through the multiplicity of resonant images is not a discrete individual but a becoming-shape of movement.
