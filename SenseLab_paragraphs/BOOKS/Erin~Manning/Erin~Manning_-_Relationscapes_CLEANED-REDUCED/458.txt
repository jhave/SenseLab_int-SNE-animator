To assume a regular passage from past to present to future is to be imprisoned within Cartesian coordinates that have little to do with Central Desert culture. For Aborigines of the Central Desert, the past is activated in the present-passing, not passively remembered. Culture and politics in the Central Desert are there for the (re)making, challenged and expressed by an opening to certain stories of creation that intertwine in complex and infinite ways the present and the past, the human and the animal, space and time. The collective memory of the future-past is passed on from generation to generation through sand paintings, dances, and songs. The Aboriginals today are not reliving their past. They are recreating their future, making use of a topological structure in which time is embedded in shifting space, and space becomes time passing.
The itineraries of the Dreaming must be seen not as a plane that can be adequately captured on a two-dimensional surface, but as functioning in many dimensions at once. As Clifford Possum paints them, the Dreamings are like knots where the actual meets the virtual in a cycle of continuous regeneration. The itineraries of the Dreaming are rule-bound but not fixed: these knots of experience are always shape-shifting.
