To explain this strange refraction of experience, whereby “I” individuates in direct engagement with the individuating world, Whitehead turns to two concepts that sound very familiar—appearance and reality—redefining them through his vocabulary of process and event. He does this to attempt to dislocate the notion that experience is a subset of an already formed body-world. For Whitehead, the world only preexists in so far as its pastness (its virtuality) can be activated in the present. To appear does not mean to conceive the past as a world strangely available to an unsuspecting present. Appearance here is much closer to a Bergsonian concept of active recollection.50 What we call the present is composed of strands of pastness recomposing and perishing through it. This does not mean that all presents are predetermined. Quite the contrary: the present is always new, but its newness is compelled in large part by experience as it is reactivated or re-collected from the past half-second of experience. To reactivate is never simply to relive. There is no world that will remain the same after reactivation. Reactivation will always, to some degree, mean invention.
