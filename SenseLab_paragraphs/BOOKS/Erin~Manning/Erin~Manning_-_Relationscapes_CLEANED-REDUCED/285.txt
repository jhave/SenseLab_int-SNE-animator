In the passage from graphic machines to chronophotography, Marey’s movement work tends toward expression more than representation. Expression and representation are at two ends of the spectrum of perception. Representation is the coming-together after the fact of an event already constituted. Expression moves-with the very act of perception. The event of expression does not allow for a schism between the event and its perception. The eventness of perception can be felt in the horse experiments, for instance, in the expression of movement galloping. The smoke experiments express movement dancing. The becoming-body of movement is in-formed by the expressions it makes possible. Oblong object becomes winding veil becomes turbulent whirlpool. This is not a metaphor: it is an actual feeling of the almost perceptible virtually seen. In these becoming-bodies of movement, what expresses and is expressed makes manifest the virtual node of the in-between. What we see is not an object, a person, an animal. What appears is the expression of body-movement relation—the interval—brimming over with microperceptions, with microexpressions never quite actualized. What is expressed is the variational field of movement. What is produced is sensation or feeling, affective tone.
