For Dalcroze, rhythm is not cadence or measure. It is not external to experience. To extrapolate from Dalcroze, this means that rhythm moves through elastic points on durational planes. These planes are milieus of transmutation. They are not locations as such: they always exceed what Whitehead calls simple location. This means that they have no discrete spatio-temporal coordinates and do not fill a definite region of space. Rhythm exfoliates, creating movements out of associated milieus that work as thresholds for the becoming-body. At these thresholds, potential is stored. To say that potential is stored means that not all that is proper to rhythm actualizes.
