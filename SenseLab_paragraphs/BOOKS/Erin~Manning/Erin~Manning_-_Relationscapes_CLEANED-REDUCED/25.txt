Seen through the specter of movement, the history of cinema converges around concepts of force rather than ideas of representation. This is a key difference between Marey and Eadweard Muybridge, one rarely exploited in theories of cinema: Marey’s practice invests in the exploration of movement’s durational force, whereas Muybridge’s work focuses on movement’s poses. Throughout Relationscapes, I explore durational force through the Deleuzian idea of series. This allows me—via Riefenstahl’s work in particular—to foreground how movement does not work primarily across immobile cuts. Riefenstahl’s extraordinary images make incipient movement felt, her “stills” mobile. Within her work we experience not images as contained by frames but a proliferation of relational series that move conjunctively across shots and frames. This serial aspect of her shots can be experienced without any effort by capturing images from her films: I encourage you to try this at home. Whereas with most filmmakers it is a challenge to find a striking image when capturing the movement into a still, with Riefenstahl each capture is evocative, foregrounding never a body as such, but how a body moves and becomes-body. What we are left with, always, is immanent movement, still-moving.
