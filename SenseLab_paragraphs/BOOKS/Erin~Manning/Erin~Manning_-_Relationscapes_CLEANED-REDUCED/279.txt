Felt movement is more difficult to plot on straight lines. Measure, or cadence— as opposed to rhythm—produces graphically equidistant formations along which a line can be plotted. Rhythm, on the other hand, is produced through inflection—the infinite folding of a line provoked by vectors of force that alter its trajectory in time and space—and operates in the register of elasticity. A tension between measure and rhythm is always operative in Marey’s work, particularly in the rift between his writings and the ways his chronophotographies express intensive movement.
