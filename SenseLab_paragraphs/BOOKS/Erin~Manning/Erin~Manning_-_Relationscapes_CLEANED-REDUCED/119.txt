For an event to occur, experience has to be pulled out of the indeterminate, activated from the virtuality of the not-yet. This provocation is the event of the occasion’s taking form. As we move together, an opening to the side may announce itself. This prehension is not simply a cue, it is a detail of activity that produces a tendency for a relational encounter. This relational encounter precedes cognitive understanding. Prearticulation fuels preacceleration, inciting a reaching-toward, not into a space predetermined, but toward a curving of space-time. Curving space-time moves the relation, activating a becomingbody. Movement’s intensive unfolding creates an embodiment of pure plastic rhythm. The fulfillment of the occasion is not the step but the recombination of forces out of which future movements will take form.
