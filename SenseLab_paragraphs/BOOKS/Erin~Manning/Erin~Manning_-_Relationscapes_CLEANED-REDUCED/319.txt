Representation in three dimensions becomes central to Marey’s approach at this point in his career. This period—which marks a shift in his practice from graphic machines to photographic processes73—is characterized by his dissatisfaction with two-dimensional representations of vertical flight and his fascination with Eadweard Muybridge’s rapid-movement stills,74 which he finds reprinted in a magazine entitled La Nature.75 Stunned by Muybridge’s images, Marey decides to create a machine that can capture the in-between of “true attitudes of movement, those positions of body in unstable balance for which no model can pose” (qtd. in Braun 1992, 47). Despite Muybridge’s clear influence on Marey at this juncture, what emerges from Marey’s process is qualitatively very different from Muybridge’s work. While Muybridge’s images look like cinematic stills, it is the movement’s interval and duration that is palpable in Marey’s images, rather than the actual stills themselves. In Marey’s work, duration is felt, whereas in Muybridge, duration is divided. Muybridge’s images do not incorporeally flow into one another, and are in fact often shuffled for narrative purposes.
