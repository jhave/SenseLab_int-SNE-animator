The interval is virtual, incorporeal. Yet it has substance: it is palpable. For Spinoza, substance is not prior to its attributes, nor does cause precede effects. As Deleuze writes, “Substance is ‘its’ infinite diversity itself; it is realized in this diversity and is nothing other than the process of production without beginning or end (beyond teleology, without goals or direction) of itself through the infinity of its attributes” (1997, xvii). The substance of the interval is its capacity to retain qualities even after its perishing within an actual occasion. This quality of movement is not: it acts. As pure duration, the interval creates a schism in linear time, preserving the future in the present. The time-slip of the interval is the future anterior: the will-not-yet-have-happened. The interval never marks a passage: it creates the potential for a passage that will have come to be. This duration is defined less by succession than by coexistence, virtually. Repetition is at the heart of the interval. The structure of repetition-in-duration is not one of resemblance but of difference. This repetition takes place within the virtual potential that is translated into an actual movement. The interval provokes the movement but does not actually move. The body moves. Repetition is the recomposing of the moving-with that is the relational body. This movement-with can be a spiral of preacceleration that incites a displacement, or it can be a movement of thought. It is always repetition with a difference. When this difference takes form, it becomes an actuality, an event in and of itself. This becoming-event creates a memory that feeds into future movement. Moving is repeating the future: dancing the not-yet. “What is recollected . . . is repeated backwards, whereas repetition is recollected forwards” (Kierkegaard 1983, 131).
