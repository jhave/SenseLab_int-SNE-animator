One work can have many dynamic forms, many concepts, many feelings or thoughts. There is no single point of identity for a work. Baggs is not the subject of In My Language: prearticulation is. The work’s subject is its dynamic form, its valuation, its conceptual resonance, its diagram. Holding to the subject as creative motor stabilizes the forces of becoming. Getting beyond this subjectivizing stance is the politics of In My Language. Holding the video to a representation of Baggs would situate her as the subject of autism. This would set her apart in a world of her own. This is exactly what In My Language struggles against. In My Language creates its own subject, making felt a force for expression that moves a particular mode of thought-feeling to its evolution as a language-in-the-making. Its subject is the force of becoming it proposes, a force for rethinking as much as a force for the experience of sensation’s relays toward prearticulation. Baggs’s video forces the passage from experience to expression, making felt the intrinsic value in the complex transduction between planes of prearticulation, including that of the political.
