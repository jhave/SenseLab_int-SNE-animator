Dreamings are both actual occasion and extensive continuum, the world as it happens and the world as it envelops its happening. Law and event, experience and force of apparition, Dreamings cycle time. Their determinacy is a matter of fact, their indetermination their appetition. Force for expression makes itself felt in the Dreaming’s infinite desire to take form once more. When an iteration of a particular Dreaming takes form—such as in Napangardi’s Karntakurlangu Jukurrpa (2000c), the continuum of the Dreaming as nexus is altered. The new version of the Karntakurlangu becomes part of the fact of the Dreaming as both event and continuum. Dreaming in its totality is thus virtually present in every new actual occasion of the Dreaming. In turn, every new iteration alters the intensive magnitude of the Dreaming’s extensive continuum.
