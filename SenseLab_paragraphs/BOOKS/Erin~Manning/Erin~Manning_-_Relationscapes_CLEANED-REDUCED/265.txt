Marey’s legacy, I believe, is the invention of perception machines that, in Paul Valéry’s words, “draw vision drawing.” In this chapter, I focus on the progression in Marey’s life from the creation of machines that perceive bodies moving to experimentations with “drawing perception drawing.” I am interested in how Marey develops modes of experimentation that play with the very mechanisms of perception, and how he creates machines that captivate perception’s endurance across states of durational becoming. Uncannily, what Marey’s experiments foreground is the very mechanism of perception itself: that to see is not to recompose an already-composed form. His work makes apparent that to see is to create-with the force of a movement taking-form, where what we see is a composition of holes (intervals) and wholes (pure experience, duration) that together create a field of forces around which perception takes form.
