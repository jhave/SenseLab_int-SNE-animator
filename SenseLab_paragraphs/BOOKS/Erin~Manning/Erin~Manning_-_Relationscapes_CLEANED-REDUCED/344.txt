In the last section of the short film, after the coupling has disintegrated into the intensity of relation, the incipience of movement becomes so intensified that what is foregrounded is no longer dancers dancing, but the interval itself. We watch as becoming-bodies of force taking form individuate, emerging through the traces of blurring movement meeting movement. Animation’s dance becomes crowded with preaccelerations, intervals of movement forming not held to the precision of the balletic pose, but fluid in the transformation of the actual into the virtual. In a steady rhythm of transformation, the choreographed pas de deux morphs from an ordered geometry into a fluid topology, the becoming-spiral taking over the shape of the dancers’ bodies, proposing an individuating curvature poised on the cusp of becoming.
