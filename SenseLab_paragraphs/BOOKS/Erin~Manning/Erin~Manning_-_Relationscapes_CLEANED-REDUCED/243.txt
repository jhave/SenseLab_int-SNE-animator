Every actual occasion has a physical and a mental pole. The physical pole is the datum for the event’s actualization. The mental pole is the potential for abstraction. Actual occasions become conceptual through the ingression of eternal objects. Eternal objects are what give actual occasions their quality. The quality of a prehension will differ in accordance with the kind of eternal objects associated with it. An eternal object is the event’s tonality—the whiteness, the hardness, the liveliness. This tonality provides a quality of relation for the event across the nexus of actual occasions.
