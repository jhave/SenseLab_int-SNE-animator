Walking is all about taking the next step. Walking is never one-off: the momentum of the last step feeds the advance into the next one. To take the next step is to step with the feeling of walking. To step with the feeling of how we are already moving is to move-with the immanent activation of the senses spacing. This means that we walk with, as well as within, the environment perceived relationally.
