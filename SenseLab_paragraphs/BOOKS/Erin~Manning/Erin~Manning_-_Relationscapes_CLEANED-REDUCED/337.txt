Pas de deux (McLaren 1967) is the most evocative of McLaren’s films on dance, and an important instance of animate form. Similar to Marey’s later work on movement, in Pas de deux McLaren uses a chronophotographic apparatus to focus not on movement’s poses but on the activity of the interval through which movement’s preacceleration can be felt. “I had always been interested in the ballet in its purest form, stripped of narrative and anecdotal conventions. I like movement for movement’s sake. Abstract ballet” (McLaren 2006).
