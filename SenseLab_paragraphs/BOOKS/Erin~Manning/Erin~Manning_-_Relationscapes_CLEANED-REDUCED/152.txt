Standing still foregrounds the quality of the activity of relation of micromovements necessary in the stilling of the bodyâ€™s temptation to lose its balance. Losing balance is the quickest way to get moving. Find the balance moving, and move with the imbalance as it corrects itself. Feel the quality of the movement, its tendencies, its potential directionalities. Create an instable body, an elastic stance. Be aware of movement coursing through the stillness. Feel the dynamism of the force of movement beginning to take form. Call this incipient action.
