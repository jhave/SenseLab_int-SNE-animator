Concepts act as differentials for prearticulation. The differential produced by a concept cuts into the plane of experience, foregrounding its enunciatory potential. As a vector of transformation, the differential forces thought into the nowness of its actualization. The production of the now is the necessity—what Nietzsche calls the destiny—of language in the making. This necessity is what brings thought—via the concept—into appearance.
