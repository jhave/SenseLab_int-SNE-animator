In the second of this 2000 series, Karntakurlangu Jukurrpa (2000b), the black and white of the dots moving into lines is significantly horizontal, leading toward a center opening that is more white than black. And yet, despite the overwhelming feeling of horizontality evoked by the Dreamingâ€™s diagram, closer inspection reveals that the composition is equally made up of vertical lines. The similarity to Karntakurlangu Jukurrpa (2000a) is the way it provokes a seeing-with of the more-than of its composition.
