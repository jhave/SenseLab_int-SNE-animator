Deleuze and Guattari define the machinic phylum “as materiality, natural and artificial, and both simultaneously; it is matter in movement, in flux, in variation, matter as a conveyor of singularities and traits of expression” (1987, 409). To render something “machinic” is to inscribe it in a process that couples it with the environment out of which it emerges. The sensing bodies in movement Marey studies are not conceived as separate from his experiments. They are integrally connected to the machines he creates. As a key aspect of the living process of experimentation, movement thus becomes an interstice of body and machine in a practice of continual invention of what a machinic body can do.
