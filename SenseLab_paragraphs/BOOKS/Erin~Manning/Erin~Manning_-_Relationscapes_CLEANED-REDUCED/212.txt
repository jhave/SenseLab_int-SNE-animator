Appearance is the active pulling out of experience from reality, the “giving form” of the nexus in the presentness of worlding. Reality must in a certain sense “precede” appearance: what appears is always less complex than reality itself. Yet reality can never be prehended as such, and, in this way, remains undifferentiated. Appearance and reality thus exist on a continuum: perception happens always for the first time through appearance, and yet appearance depends on the activation of reality. To experience is always to exist on the cusp of appearance and reality: it is to co-live the present as a pastness of emergence that will only be known in its future-pastness-becoming-present. There is no moment that precedes the prehension out of which perception occurs: the future and the past coexist through the present.
