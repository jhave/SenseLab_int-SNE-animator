Marey’s flying machines never actually manage to fly. This does not seem to dissuade him. Still convinced that he will find a way to transform a birdlike instrument into a flying machine, in 1874—as vice-president of the Société française de navigation aérienne—Marey opens his laboratory and materials to Victor Tatin, a young engineer who had already built a few flying birds propelled by elastic springs (that crashed to the ground). Due to his earlier graphic experiments measuring the movement of air in bird flight, Marey knew that the faster the bird, the more air resistance on its wing, the more solid its trajectory through the air. Slower birds have to move their wings faster to increase the force of resistance. Marey continued to believe that this was key in the development of a flying machine.
