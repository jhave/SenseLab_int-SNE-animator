Propositions never attend solely to the datum. In My Language is not “about” autism. It works with the emergence of a language experienced from the enabling constraints of autism, yet does much more than explicate autism’s relation to language. In My Language proposes the creation of relational objects for thinking-in-action. It does this not only to make clear how Baggs thinks but to propose this form of expression for a rethinking of a theory of language.
