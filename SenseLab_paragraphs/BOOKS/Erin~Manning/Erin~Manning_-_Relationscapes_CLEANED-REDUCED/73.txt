To repeat is to act, to live the interval. Repetition is forgetting (in the Nietzschean sense): preacceleration not to find a previously lost displacement but to encounter the potential of what is not-yet. On the dance floor I lose my place when I repeat to remember. The music dulls, the interval dissolves, and I am no longer dancing with you. Now everything has become a question of displacement: the flow of dance falls apart. Important: we cannot dance together alone. Repetition must remember relation while it actively forgets past combinations. Relation must be reinvented. To dance relationally is not to represent movement but to create it.
