Whitehead talks about facts this way. Rather than situating “facts” as the truth-value of an iteration, Whitehead suggests that facts are those occasions of experience that are fully composed and yet stand for more than themselves: “Every proposition proposing a fact must, in its complete analysis, propose the general character of the universe required for that fact” (1929/1978, 11). A fact is not self-sustaining—it is a relational co-occurrence that marks the in-practice of an event’s worlding.
The event of Mina Mina that Napangardi paints in Salt on Mina Mina (2002) is qualitatively quite different from her 2001 painting. The 2002 Salt on Mina Mina’s dimensions are 122 x 198 cm, and it lies horizontal. Where Salt on Mina Mina (2001) was composed of dotted lines that filled almost every part of the canvas, creating a foreground-background resonance, Salt on Mina Mina (2002) foregrounds the blackness of the background through the creation of open spaces. The black openings in the canvas are the places where the dots do not meet. This leaves us with the feeling that the dotted lines actually reach each other more frequently. Strangely, even though there is more open space on this canvas, it feels as though there is less of an intensive center. The canvas is both emptier and busier, its dotted lines cutting in their precision. This time the painting’s diagram—its intensive force—feels wider, more dispersed, as though there were different rhythms coexisting within one intensive space.
