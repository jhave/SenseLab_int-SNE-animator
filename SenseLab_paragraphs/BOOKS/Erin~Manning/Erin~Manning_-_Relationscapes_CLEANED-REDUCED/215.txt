A dancing body is a sensing body in movement. A dancer actively perceives and moves worlds such that new kinds of experiential space-times are constituted. These worldings are pullings out of an experiential ground that shifts with each of the dancerâ€™s movements. The dancer senses and creates microspace-times in one and the same movement, individuating with each shift in ground. The ground becomes part of the shifting through which these individuations develop, emerging as a key aspect of the series dancer-movement-ground.
