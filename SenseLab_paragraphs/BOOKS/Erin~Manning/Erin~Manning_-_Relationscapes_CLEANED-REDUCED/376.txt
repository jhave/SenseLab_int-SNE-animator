Riefenstahl’s images foreground dynamic form. Dynamic form is not movement-of but movement-with. Boccioni uses sculpture to explore the potential of dynamic form. Even a material as seemingly opaque and dense as marble, he suggests, can become-movement. This becoming-movement occurs first within the matter-form itself. Boccioni’s investigations into sculpture explicitly challenge hylomorphism, the belief that form is the finite element in the shaping of matter. Hylomorphism’s claim: once shaped, matter stills—immobile cut. Boccioni resists this view, exploring instead how what seems immobile may instead be engaged in a kind of absolute movement, a virtual becoming that has its own velocity, a velocity felt not only in the infinite transgressions of both matter and form (in their continual becomings) but also in the dynamism of their coming together. In his “Technical Manifesto of Futurist Sculpture 1912” he writes: “We must take the object which we wish to create and begin with its central core. In this way we shall uncover new ways and new forms which link it invisibly but mathematically to an external plastic infinity and to an internal plastic infinity. This new plastic art will then be a translation, in plaster, bronze, glass . . . of those atmospheric planes which bind and intersect things” (1970, 52). He calls this physical transcendentalism.
