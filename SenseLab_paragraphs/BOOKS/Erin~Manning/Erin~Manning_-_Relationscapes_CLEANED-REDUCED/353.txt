Dawn begins to rise as the next body appears, the camera dancing around it and then panning out. The violins begin to play, lending an eeriness to the encounter between the statues. Bodies, face to face, seem to flow away from one another, meeting and dissolving. The next body makes itself felt in an atmosphere of smoke, as though rising from the ruins. From stone to flesh, the between of night and day, of appearance and disappearance, creates the first living being: the stone body of the discus thrower begins to move. We watch the magnificent transformation from incipiency to displacement as the discus thrower merges with and then detaches himself from the sculptural remains.
