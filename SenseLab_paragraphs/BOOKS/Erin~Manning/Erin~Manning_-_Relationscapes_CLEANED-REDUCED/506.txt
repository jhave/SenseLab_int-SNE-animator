A shuffle that is not really a step is a quiver. It is an intensive movement that foregrounds not a displacement but a qualitative shift. A dance of the not-yet. Weight on the knees connects the dancer to the earth, giving form to a preacceleration that is in deep alliance with the earth moving. Aboriginal dancing dances the earth to listen to its story tell itself. “It’s all about physical memory—to be able to tell the story by putting yourself in the movement” (Mundine 2002, 68). This is Salt on Mina Mina’s call: put yourself in the movement.
