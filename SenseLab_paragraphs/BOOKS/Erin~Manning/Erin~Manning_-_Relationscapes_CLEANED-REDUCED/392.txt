The shot of these men is first taken from above and behind and then slowly pans toward stone columns where a delegation awaits. As it reaches the columns, the camera alters its trajectory and begins to move across the shot to film intermittently from behind stone. This shift in the camerawork alters the composition of the shot. What we want to perceive is momentarily eclipsed by the stone columns. The image of the three menâ€™s approach is one of appearance/disappearance that brings their grandeur into focus while catching in its intensity the stone-coldness of the perched eagle amid the immense swastika-clad flags that compose the militarized space.
