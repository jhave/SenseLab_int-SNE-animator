Michel Foucault defines biopolitics not as that which replaces the disciplinary but as a series that works conjunctively with the notion of the disciplined individual while it moves beyond it toward a body-becoming. In the biopolitical episteme, movements of bodies work not at the level of individual detail but with global mechanisms of equilibrium, of regularity, of normativity. To interject into the normativity of the body-politic does not imply an intervention within a particular body but an intervention within the micropolitics of movement itself. Riefenstahl’s work emerges from this biopolitical tendency, yet already moves beyond it through the biogram. Riefenstahl’s becoming-bodies preempt the next episteme, one that concerns neither what a single or a group body can do but how a focus on movement moving can create a critique of pure feeling.
