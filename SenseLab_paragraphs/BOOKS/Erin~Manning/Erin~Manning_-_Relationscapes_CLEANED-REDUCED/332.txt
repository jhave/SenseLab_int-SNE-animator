The interval is never neutral. It holds in abeyance the traces of movement-passing and prepares movement-coming. That we do not see movement as such in the interval suggests that to experience the feeling of movement is not to view a displacement. It is to sense the force of a movement taking form through its preacceleration. This is what McLaren means when he says he seeks to “film the essence of movement” (qtd. in Bastiancich 1997, 102; my translation).
