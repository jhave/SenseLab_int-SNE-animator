Preacceleration is tapped into by the interval, actualized not in the displacement as such but in the potential of its actualization. Preacceleration is like the breath that releases speech, the gathering-toward that leaps our bodies into a future unknowable. It goes something like this: preacceleration—relation—interval—intensification—actualization—extension—displacement—preacceleration. Simultaneity of experience creates sensing bodies in movement creates shifting space-times of experience. “Space . . . is not matter or extension but the schema of matter, that is, the representation of the limit where the movement of expansion (détente) would come to an end as the external envelope of all possible extensions” (Deleuze 1991a, 87). Bodies are never independent of the extensions of space and the matter of time: bodies are durational. The interval makes this duration manifest, virtually.
