To arrive at language in the making, Relationscapes begins with the concept not of prearticulation but of preacceleration. The reason for this is that to think language before it takes form we must first understand how to conceive of taking form itself. Taking form, I suggest, is key to a developing vocabulary of movement that foregrounds incipience rather than displacement. What I mean by this is that movement need not be thought, in the first instance, as a quantitative displacement from a to b. Following Bergson, Relationscapes places the emphasis on the immanence of movement moving: how movement can be felt before it actualizes. Preacceleration refers to the virtual force of movement’s taking form. It is the feeling of movement’s in-gathering, a welling that propels the directionality of how movement moves. In dance, this is felt as the virtual momentum of a movement’s taking form before we actually move. Important: the pulsion toward directionality activates the force of a movement in its incipiency. It does not necessarily foretell where a movement will go.
