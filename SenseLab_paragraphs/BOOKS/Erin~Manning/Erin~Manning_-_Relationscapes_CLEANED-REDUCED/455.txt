The relation the Dreaming proposes is not composed separately from its eventness. Dreamings are here and now as much as they are then and before. Dreamings are neither nostalgic nor predictable. They are concern for the present-passing. Reembodied through paint, the Dreamings make the not-yet felt, asking, always, to live again, to be lived again. Once more. The repetition of the act is its infinite difference. The painting of the dots, one at a time, for hours on end, is a differential living-with that continuously reinvents with the stories that belong to a history of time-on-earth that exceeds the very notion of stable territory, calling forth worlds that extend far beyond what geography can map. The intimacy of relation is felt in the reliving of the Dream, told as a life-giving story that intensifies contact between lineage, land, movement. In the paintings, this intimacy is experienced in the pulsations of the dots, in the rhythms of the layered surfaces at play, of intensities interweaving. These paintings ask us to move (move away! come closer! look again!), figuring movement such that what is felt is not the representation of a story but the act of the telling itself. This telling creates conjunctions and disjunctions, insisting, as Kngwarreye is famous for saying, on “a whole lot.”
