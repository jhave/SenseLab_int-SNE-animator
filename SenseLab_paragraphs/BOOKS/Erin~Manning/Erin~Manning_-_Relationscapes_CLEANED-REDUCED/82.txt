What Gil calls the plane of immanence is the interval. It populates the dance and makes tangible, through dance, how movement operates. It underscores the fact that movement is never displacement. Movement is incipient action: a dance of the not-yet. “To dance is to create immanence through movement: this is why there is no meaning outside of the plane nor outside of the actions of the dancer. . . . The meaning of movement is the very movement of meaning” (Gil 2002, 125).
