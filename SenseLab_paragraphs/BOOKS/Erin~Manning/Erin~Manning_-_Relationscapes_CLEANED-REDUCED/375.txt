Riefenstahl’s images move. They move both intensively and extensively, always connected to the atmospheres they co-create. Like Boccioni’s claim that “our bodies penetrate the sofas upon which we sit, and the sofa penetrates our bodies” (1970a, 28), Riefenstahl insists on thinking the image relationally, foregrounding the role of movement in the very creation of the image-concept. She underscores this important stylistic device by refusing to simply add movement—as a secondary operation—to a preexistent image. For Riefenstahl, interpenetration of strata is key. Boccioni’s becoming-sofa functions like Riefenstahl’s becoming-body. They both work with the idea of movement as topological transformation, a folding-in and through.
