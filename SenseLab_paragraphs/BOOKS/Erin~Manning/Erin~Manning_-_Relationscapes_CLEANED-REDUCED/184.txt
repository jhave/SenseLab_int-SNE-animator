When auto-activation ceases, time stops. Infolding toward emptiness, the frozen Rose feels no link to a past because to feel that past, it would have to be activated. She would have to think new thoughts. But this is precisely what she cannot do. She can only re-think or re-feel the absoluteness of her inertia. The vastness of that smoothness lulls her into an even deeper nothing in which sensa are present but not directly perceived. Process without event.
