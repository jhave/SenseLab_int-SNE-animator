When symbolic reference occurs, a worlding takes place. This worlding can lead to false premises: the very fact that it can be delusional is a key aspect of symbolic reference. Perceptions can mislead us—the bump on the floor may turn out to be a cat. This capacity for delusion gives our worlds shape. Within the flatness of smooth space, delusion is non-existent. What takes over is a repetition of the same, an overwhelming nowness that becomes a nothingness. Because nothing ever changes, nothing ever develops. Rose calls this the “flatness of nothing.” This nothing is the effect of presentational immediacy folding in on itself absolutely, resulting in an affectless layering of bare sensa. In a dialogue with Sacks, Rose explains.
