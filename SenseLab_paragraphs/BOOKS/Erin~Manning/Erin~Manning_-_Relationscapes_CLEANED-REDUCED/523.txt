In creating work that remains open to an infinity of potential evocations, Napangardi’s art risks that the iterations of her Dreaming be colonized, immobilized, arrested within dominant belief systems. The plurality alive in her work always risks being overtaken by the forces of encounter it invites. And yet, paraphrasing Nietzsche, Deleuze writes: “A force would not survive if it did not first of all borrow the features of the forces with which it struggles” (1983, 5). Active force always risks capture by reactive force. Such capture might result in the “translation,” the “rendering” of Napangardi’s work within a stabilizing narrative of identity or representation. Yet, like much Aboriginal artwork, Napangardi’s art resists this risk, its complexity of iterations foregrounding the force of the Dreaming’s mutations of expression rather than simply giving a narrative to the present fully formed. Perhaps this is due to the fact that Dreamings themselves have survived changing worlds (more than 50,000 years of continuous history in Australia), which suggests that they are capable of working with a coexistence of forces, bending to pressures when necessary and reemerging stronger. Their will to power, as felt in Napangardi’s work, seems to be their very readiness for reemergence in a continuous dance of eternal return.
