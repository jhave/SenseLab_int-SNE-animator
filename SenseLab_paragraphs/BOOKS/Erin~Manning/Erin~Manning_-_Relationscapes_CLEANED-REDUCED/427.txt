Creating with light and its absence is a way of asking us to move light. We feel the beckoning of light in our attempt to make the form concrete. Incorporeal Movement plays with light and shadow to create form, merging the concrete with the abstract. This does not happen by simply standing in front of it. Staying in place focuses the light, and with the imposition of stability, the appearance of form recedes.
