Rhythm can never be measured as such: it operates conjunctively. It is the and . . . and . . . and . . . of the rhizome that never finds a final territorialization. Rhythm provokes a milieu that is capable of accelerations and decelerations beyond the control of the apparatus that would seek to structure it. For Dalcroze as for Riefenstahl, rhythm becomes body. Dalcroze writes: “It is impossible to conceive a rhythm without thinking of a body in motion” (1921, 82). Movement produces rhythms as rhythms produce bodies. The biogram in Riefenstahl is the becoming sculptural of rhythm that creates a body-becoming. Rhythm: the durational modulation out of which a biogram is born.
