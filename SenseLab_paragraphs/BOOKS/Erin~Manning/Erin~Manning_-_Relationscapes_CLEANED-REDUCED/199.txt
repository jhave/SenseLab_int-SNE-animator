Experiential transformation is rare. It depends on the capacity to create events that are “new” enough that they catch our attention, and graspable enough that we can relate to them. “Relate” is the key word here: we must feel these occasions of experience in their eventness. To simply watch an event—to remain a passive spectator to its inner workings—does not result in experiential transformation. Transformation entails a shift in affective tone such that the participating spectator feels the performance, responding to it through an emphasis as much on its duration—its capacity to create experiential space-times—as through its content—its micromovements in the making. New technology and dance performances do suggest the capacity to produce platforms of relation that call forth new kinds of process that create new kinds of events. Yet they too often remain limited by the dimensions of the software. This tends to call forth a docile body, both in the software-conformist dancer and in the technologically attentive spectator. Affective transformation depends on evolution in the machinic system such that both bodies and technological systems are altered. Technogenesis requires transduction.
