Machines such as Marey’s are more than the combination of their parts. What is at stake in these kinds of machines is their technicity, the ways in which they create associated milieus—active intervals—that open experimentation to evolution. Each experimental process creates an evolution toward a particular relational series—that of the blood-heart-graph, that of the foot-sensorground—that incites Marey to devise yet another technique, not only for the measuring of actualized movement, but for the stimulation of virtual movement.68 Each experiment also contains a measure of unpredictability—since new combinatory series are always taking form—that makes novel demands on the machinic process. While machines might otherwise be understood as passive mechanisms for the measuring of activity, I believe that Marey’s machines are relationally entwined with the experiments he devises. In fact, the machines become his mode of experimentation such that what he devises through them itself becomes “machinic.”
