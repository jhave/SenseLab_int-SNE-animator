Solomon’s participation in the ritual places us in a completely different relation to depression’s working than does Bifo’s account. A Rwandan who encounters Solomon several years later articulates this difference succinctly. After hearing of Solomon’s experience in Senegal, this man says: You know, we had a lot of trouble with Western mental health workers who came here immediately after the genocide, and we had to ask some of them to leave... [The problem was that] their practice did not involve being outside in the sun, like you’re describing, which is, after all, where you begin to feel better. There was no music or drumming to get your blood flowing again when you’re depressed, and you’re low, and you need to have your blood flowing. There was no sense that everyone had taken the day off so that the entire community could come together to try to lift you up and bring you back to joy. There was no acknowledgment that the depression is something invasive and external that could actually be cast out of you again. Instead, they would take people one at a time into these dingy little rooms and have them sit around for an hour or so and talk about bad things that had happened to them. We had to get them to leave the country.
