Guattari would resist, it seems to me, any normative account of depression that would situate it in the agency-volition-intentionality triad. When Bifo speaks of Guattari’s inability to use his time well, he provides exactly this kind of normative account of depression: he proposes that Guattari demonstrates a lack of volition, suggesting that in the best-case scenario, Guattari would have the kind of will, the kind of agency, that would better direct his decision to align himself to projects “that matter.” Guattari would also be suspicious of an account of depression that kept it within the bounds of the subject. He would be more likely to align himself, it seems to me, to the following account of depression, which, unlike Bifo’s analysis, refuses to situate depression solely in the individual, making it a collective problem for which a group-subject must be invented. This is a story narrated by Andrew Solomon, who has written widely about his struggle with depression. In this story, Solomon recalls a trip to Senegal where he experienced a ritual for depression called ndeup.
