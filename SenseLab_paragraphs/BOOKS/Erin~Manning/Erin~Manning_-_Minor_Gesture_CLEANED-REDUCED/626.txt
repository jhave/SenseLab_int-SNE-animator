Idle No More makes debt social by recognizing that there is no repayment that will do justice to the pain. There is no repayment that can absolutely undo the effects of environmental degradation, no repayment that can still the history of human suffering in the disenfranchised communities of the Canadian North. There is no way to bring back the families destroyed by the residential schools. But there are ways of being rhythmically, differentially in-act, of idling no more and asking, collectively, what else? What else can be imagined? What else can we walk toward, or around, or behind? There is a way to claim the stories, and to continue to write them. There is a way to compose the speech, a speech that would sound very different from Harperâ€™s because it knows the way the fissures of experience crowd the surface, it knows about the tricksters and their ability to jump onto the what if and fly with it, it knows about the power of fabulation.
Fabulation, it bears repeating, is not the denial of the truth. It is another species altogether, a dramatization born of joy that composes at the limits of experience in the making. Fabulation is true! Absolutely true, in the only register of truth affirmation knows: the pragmatically speculative. Pragmatic because it does what it does, it mobilizes just this way, under just these conditions. And speculative because how it will unfold, what it can do, what else it will be, remains unknowable in advance of the doing.
