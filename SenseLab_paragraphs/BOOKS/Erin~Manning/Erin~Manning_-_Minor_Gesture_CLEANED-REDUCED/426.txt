In James’s “The Feeling of Effort,” there is a strong emphasis on how the terminus and attention work together. Again, a subject-oriented approach is critiqued: will is not the activator of the pull. Attention is fielded relationally rather than directed by a volitional subject: “Our standing up, walking, talking, all this never demands a distinct impulse of the will, but is adequately brought about by the pure flux of thought” (Lotze in James 1969: 183). Thought, James underlines, is “intercurrent” with action. The movement of thought, which James sometimes calls a “representation,” is not representation in any usual sense. The movement of thought is not a precomposed image. It is a virtual event, an activity on the edge of movement, a preacceleration. Attention is in the relation.
