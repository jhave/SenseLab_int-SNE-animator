What was left behind is the “what else” of Kawakubo’s procedural fashionings. This leftover share of movement-moving, the share that has not quite taken form, opens up future processes. Like the what else in Forsythe that activates the more-than of form, the what else of fashioning is what opens material to the potential of its infinite line.
It is important to emphasize that these garments (like many others), placed on display for the runways of that 2011 season, are not for direct consumption. They take the season’s garments (the works that will be sold in boutiques around the world) and emphasize their procedurality, making felt not only the tentativeness of their propositions, but the more-than, the what else, of their constructedness.
Kawakubo states repeatedly that fashion is neither the starting nor the endpoint of her research. Fashion for her is not limited to the idea of a holding-in-place of a body as pre-formed. Nor is it about deconstructing the past in the linear sense often attributed to both her work and that of other Japanese designers, such as Yohji Yamamoto, nor simply, as the deconstructive vocabulary within fashion would have it, of revealing tradition and pulling it apart at the seams. It is, rather, about constructing toward a tentative holding in place, thereby cleaving the body-concept toward an architecting that sculpts mobility more than form. That this work reveals its seams is of course necessary at times, and among my favorite pieces of Comme des Garçons are these early works, not simply because they shed and fade and show their fragility, but because they open the act of dressing to the fragile articulations of fashion’s very composition, allowing the garment to function as a lively interstice. That the garments feel alive is key to their artfulness.
