As study, what philosophy can do is attend to the appetitions of other practices, composing with their thinking in the act. No method will ever assist philosophy in this enterprise, nor will any method be able to bring the complexity of divergent appetitions together as though they were one. Thought must not be mapped onto practice: it is an emergent, incipient tendency to be discovered in the field of activation of practices co-composing. To map thought in advance of its speculative propositions would diminish the force of study and reduce the operation to the status of the creation of false problems and badly stated questions. In study, what is prized is not the homogenization of thinking-doing, the superimposition of one practice onto the other as though they were the same, but the creation of conditions for encountering the operative transversality of difference at the heart of all practice.
