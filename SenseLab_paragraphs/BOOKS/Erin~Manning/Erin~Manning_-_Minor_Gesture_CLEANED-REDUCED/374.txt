Autistic perception is the ideal modality for carrying the feeling, since autistic perception does not hurry toward form. While the event of perception does eventually resolve into form, allowing autistics to parse, the fact of living so fully in the act means that the middling of experience is very familiar to them. Blackman can of course move between autistic perception and the chunking of tendencies into subjective forms, and she does. But first, she says, comes the carrying, and so carrying is written into the text before being excised, its excision occurring as though in the real-time of events concrescing. But what of its trace? Can it really be excised? In a gesture geared toward neurotypicals, Blackman attempts to background the carrying to make language more stable, and yet the feeling-full is hard to parse into language-forms: the carrying nonetheless makes itself felt, even in its literal absence, weaving its way through the seams of the writing. For carrying is what language does, particularly when language lets itself feel.
