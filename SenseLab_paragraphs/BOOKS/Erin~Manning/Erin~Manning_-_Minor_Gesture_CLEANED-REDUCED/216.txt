This is not to dismiss the human’s role in the field of artistic participation, but to recognize that the weather pattern does not primarily express itself in or via the human. Weather patterns move across experience in the making in a field of relation activated in the register of the more-than human in the ecology of practices generated by the variational field itself. What would a work feel like whose mandate it was not to entertain us, but to entertain the already entertaining environment? To attend to this question is to open up the issue not only of where the human is situated in the process of emergent fieldings activated by weather patterns, but to inquire into the very limits of interactivity. For there remains a tendency, within the very concept of art-based interaction, to place the human in the center as the arbiter of process. To conceive of a work that resisted this tendency, to emphasize the transindividual share foregrounded in the art of participation, would necessitate a focus directed toward the environment’s own capacity to make felt the complex ecologies at work. Such an inquiry, it seemed to me, would not only open up the question of how an artwork can create the conditions for a participation generated as much by the environment itself as by human engagement, but would also provide a stronger sense of how, even when the participatory component of a work is led by human intervention, much more than human agency is at work.
