From the start Idle No More refused categorical breakdowns based on identity. Its focus was education, forward-thinking, not bloodlines. It was concentrated around Indigenous issues, but it knew the field needed to be everything but either/or. The teach-ins that at first focused on parliamentary bills that would continue to erode First Nations sovereignty, that would continue to undo existing environmental protections, soon became teach-ins that included broader issues of Indigenous rights. These teachins and the ones they bred truly became study: I felt their effects in my classes, on the street. More people joined, in Canada and beyond. Some walked sixteen hundred kilometers across Canada to protest with Chief Spence and to support the hunger strike she was undertaking based on “a historical survival diet for indigenous communities facing food shortages and land loss in colonial policies” (Simpson 2013).13 Chief Spence hoped to convince Prime Minister Harper and Governor General David Johnston to meet with her to discuss First Nations leadership. She implored the government to have a “nation-to-nation” meeting about the James Bay Treaty (Treaty 9), signed by communities in 1905 and 1906, that promised that the communities would receive benefits that served to balance anything that they were giving.”14 She felt strongly, as did other supporters of Idle No More, that Bill c-45, the Conservative government’s omnibus budget bill, which contained changes to the Navigable Waters Act, including waterways in First Nations territory, would affect ecological conditions and make it easier to sell reserve land to non-Natives.15 Each one of us who considers themselves an activist became involved, even those among us who didn’t participate in the walk or the teach-ins, recognizing in perhaps a new way that there can be no cause that does not in some way connect to the injustices First Nations have suffered, and continue to suffer. As the website says: “Everyone is invited to join the movement.”
