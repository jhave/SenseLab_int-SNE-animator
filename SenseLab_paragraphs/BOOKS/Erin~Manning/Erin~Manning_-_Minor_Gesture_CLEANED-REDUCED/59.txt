The decisional cut is everywhere active. Take the example of picking up milk at the corner store. You might assume that this simple act is completely volitional. But much is left open to the event’s own process of decision, even in what seems to be such a simple, habitual act. You may not have realized, for instance, the way your movement was immanently directed and shaped not by your will alone, but by the pull of the corner store, or what James calls the “terminus,” a pull that doesn’t necessarily include a direct follow-through. For while the store did get you up, while its immanent directionality did incite directional mobility, it is possible that in this corner store instance you’re still in your living-room because on the way to the door a song began to play on the radio that brought the couch into focus and you found yourself lying down to listen to it instead of getting milk. Likely, when asked, you will say that you decided to lie on the couch, that you didn’t really need the milk, but in fact the event decided and you followed, open to the nature of the event-based improvisation that is part of all our daily choreographies.
