The political opening that lurks here is built of a procedural architecture called the undercommons, a concept coined by Fred Moten and Stefano Harney.17  The undercommons is not a given site, not a place predefined, not even a recognizable enclave we could return to having found it once. The undercommons is an emergent collectivity that is sited in the encounter. Allied to the minor gesture, it is an activator of a tendency more than it is an offering of a commonality. What makes it a commons is not the existing gathering but its speculative presence as an ecology of practices. The undercommons is a tentative holding in place of fragile comings-intorelation, physical and virtual, that create the potential to reorient fields of life-living—a belief in the ineffable and its powers of resistance keep it alive. In Moten and Harney’s reading of the undercommons, the university looms large as a site in need. The academic institution also has a major role to play with respect to the policing of neurotypicality. For this reason, like Moten and Harney, I will first dwell on the example of what an undercommons might look like in the context of academia before then opening the undercommons beyond the strictures of the academic institution to whatelse study looks like in the everyday.
