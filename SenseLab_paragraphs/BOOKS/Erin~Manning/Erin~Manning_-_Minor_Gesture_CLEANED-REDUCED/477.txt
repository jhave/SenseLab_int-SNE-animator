Despite my respect for Bifo as an activist and thinker, I hope to challenge his account of depression, particularly his account of the relationship between depression and activism. I will do so by paying close attention to the story told by Pelbart of the chaosmosis at the heart of the “not-me” which is inhabited at once by petrification and spark. Taking the act not simply as that which is in the service of the neoliberal economy, but more broadly as the force of the event through which minor gestures course, and taking depression out of the context of an individual sadness, I want to explore the operative passage between petrification and spark.
