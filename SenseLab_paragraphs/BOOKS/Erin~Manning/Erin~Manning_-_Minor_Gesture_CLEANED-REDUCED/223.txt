When artwork entertains the environment, the proposition is that there is an awareness in the field of relation to how the environment is attuned to the gestures active within its ecology. From these exhibitions, a number of questions emerged: How do we make felt, for the human participant, a minor gesture that remains largely imperceptible? Does the work do its work if it cannot be readily experienced as such by the human?
When a minor gesture opens the way for an experiential variation on the object, what emerges is artful. Artfulness is the expression, in a time of its own making, of the processual force of what art can do. It takes seriously the how of the object’s variability, taking as art’s measure not how it fits within the matrix of what is currently on exhibition in art circles, but how a process’s minor gestures generate the more-than of art-as-object or effect.
