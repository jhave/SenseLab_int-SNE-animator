Affirmation’s movement toward the world is one of mutual inclusion. In a logic of both-and it facilitates modes of coexistence for difference. Its work is not to resolve contradiction. This does not mean that affirmation is comfortable or comforting. Its work is to invent conditions for new ways of activating the threshold of experience, new ways of experimenting in the complexity of what does not easily fold into a smooth surface. Affirmation is striating more than smoothing, its operative potential more at the level of the crease than the stable ground. Affirmation is the push, the pull that keeps things unsettled, a push that ungrounds, unmoors, even as it propels.
Because of how it makes the threshold operative, affirmation is negation’s most powerful enemy. Negation’s work involves deactivating the threshold. Where negation stops, turning the field inward, affirmation moves, propelling it elsewhere. There is affinity between affirmation and negation, but as Deleuze writes, there is no confusion (2002: 54). Where negation remains so certain of the stakes of the encounter, affirmation delights in the creativity of what else that encounter could do. Where negation is content to dwell in the judgment of the it is, affirmation is too curious to
stay within the already-defined now. This is what makes negation reactive, and affirmation active. “Only active force asserts itself, it affirms its difference and makes its difference an object of enjoyment and affirmation. Reactive force, even when it obeys, limits active force, imposes limitations and partial restrictions on it and is already controlled by the spirit of the negative” (Nietzsche 1968 in Deleuze 2002: 55–56). Two versions of the in-act: one heavy with the weight of its delimitations, the other exuberantly reaching-toward.
