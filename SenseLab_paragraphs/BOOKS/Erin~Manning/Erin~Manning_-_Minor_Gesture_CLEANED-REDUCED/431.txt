Autistics speak of the difficulty of associating one movement-event to another. Whereas a neurotypical might consider every coffee cup to be one and the same in the sense that a coffee cup is anything in which coffee can be drunk, an autistic might be more likely to see the complexity of each cup’s difference, challenging the sensory-motor assumption that repetitive tasks easily sort themselves into habits that can then be taken up in a different scenario. Blackman explains: “[As a child] each time I was introduced to [a] practical skill by new baby-sitters, and later by teachers, it was as if it were the very first time, because the concrete movement in my own body was in a completely different universe from the world of chaotic artifacts which I was expected to place in some kind of arbitrary order. In the fullness of time some of these tasks became comprehensible, but this did not mean that I was motivated to perform the jobs that all these people considered important” (2013: 34). The field remains open to potential variation. There is no question that this can be discouraging for autistics, who often mention that they would like the repetition of everyday tasks to come more easily to them.
