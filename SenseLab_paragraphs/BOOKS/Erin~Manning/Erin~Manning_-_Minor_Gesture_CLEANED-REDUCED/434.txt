If movement is by nature nonvoluntary, generated to attention by its dance in the between of subjects and objects forming, a new definition of facilitation must be invented. The facilitator is not there to prevent the autistic from wallowing in autistic perception. Facilitation is the force of activation in the relation that allows autistic perception to come to expression. Here, relation must be seen as a relationscape, not as a neutral between of subjects and objects in the model of interaction. How the field parses for experience is always connected to how its relations play themselves out.
