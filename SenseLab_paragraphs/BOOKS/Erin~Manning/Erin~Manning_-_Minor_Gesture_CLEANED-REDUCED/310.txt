It is not my wish, once again, to underestimate the frustration Kedar feels when he writes: “I am sure a lot of autistic people are smart like me, but they have no means to show it. It’s not just speech. It’s fine motor. It’s body awareness. It’s insurmountable obstacles that prevent the reply, so the autistic kid is treated like an unintelligent kid” (2012: 48). The neurotypically oriented world we live in privileges consciousness as aligned to instrumentality over nonconscious, nonvolitional tendings. It is this very neurotypical perspective that teaches us that a body begins and ends in a skin envelope we can readily perceive. Again and again in young childhood we are given instructions that assist us in differentiating our skin from that of the world. Think, for instance, of the young child’s difficulty in assigning hurt when they fall, and their tendency to point to the ground instead of their knee. These teachings, which also tend to foreground the normatively rational over the emergently creative or intuitive, the individual over the relational, tune our existence toward a very simple notion of what a body can do. This, over time, convinces the child that singling out objects and subjects by categorizing experience is a necessary part of growing up. That this approach backgrounds the animism of their childhood beliefs is simply taken as a necessary rite of passage toward the agency that comes with adulthood. This invariably results in the backgrounding in experience of the lively continuity and co-composition between body and world.
