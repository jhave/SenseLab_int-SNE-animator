Each occasion of experience, once it has achieved its subjective form, is absolutely what it is. It is how this event came into itself just this way. But of course each event is influenced by how other occasions of experience have come to concrescence, and it carries those concrescences with it in germ.3 To create a continuity of experience, there has to be a way that occasions of experience continue to affect one another. One way this happens in Whitehead is through nonsensuous perception, a concept that describes the folding of past tonalities into present events. Nonsensuous perception does not mean that the past fully formed fits into present occasions. It means that the tendencies of pastness contribute to how the current event unfolds. Subjective aim is key here, as a lure for feeling (1978: 85). Feeling here is the force, in the event, that lures experience into a tendency-to-form. This tendency-to-form is not back-traceable to something that could be easily encapsulated as “the past” fully formed: pastness is a current that runs through it. Whitehead writes: “The breath of feeling which creates a new individual fact has an origination not wholly traceable to the mere data. It conforms to the data, in that it feels the data. But the how of feeling, though it is germane to the data, is not fully determined by the data. The relevant feeling is not settled, as to its inclusions or exclusions of ‘subjective form,’ by the data about which the feeling is concerned” (1978: 85). An occasion of experience is the fullness of what a feeling has felt as actualized through a singular subjective form. This subjective form carries both the feeling in its operative fullness as virtual force and the in-act of what that feeling has felt in this singular instance. The feeling, like Blackman’s carrying-feeling, is that which moves the event toward what Whitehead calls its satisfaction. It is the event’s agency.
