Radical empiricism begins in the midst, in the mess of relations not yet organized into terms such as “subject” and “object.” In this mess, everything that happens is real, be it the redness of the fire or its molecular makeup. James calls this field of relations “pure experience,” pure understood not in the sense of “purity” but in the sense of immanent to actual relations. Pure experience is on the cusp of the virtual and the actual: in the experiential register of the not-quite-yet. It is of experience in the sense that it affectively contributes to how experience settles into what comes to be. As with Deleuze’s actual-virtual distinction, pure experience is the in-folding of potential that keeps actual experience open to its more-than. The virtual is never the opposite of the actual—it is how the actual resonates beyond the limits of its actualization. In this relational field of emergent experience, there is no preestablished hierarchy, nor is there a preconstituted subjectposition external to the event. There are only emergent relations. James writes: “Nothing shall be admitted as fact . . . except what can be experienced at some definite time by some experient; and for every feature of fact ever so experienced, a definite place must be found somewhere in the final system of reality. In other words: Everything real must be experienceable somewhere, and every kind of thing experienced must somewhere be real” (1996: 160).
