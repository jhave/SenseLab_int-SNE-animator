Lucy Blackman’s 2013 Carrying Autism, Feeling Language (with commentary by Mary Jane “Jay” Blackman) everywhere returns to this question of facilitation. Composed almost two decades after Blackman’s first autobiographical account of coming to language through facilitation, this recent account, written after having received an ma in English literature and publishing her own fiction, is less about Blackman’s need to prove her intelligence than it is about querying the neurotypical assumption that experience, and specifically its relationship to language, is inherently individual (Blackman 2001). Communication and the art of participation in the world for Blackman clearly includes the carrying of facilitation.
