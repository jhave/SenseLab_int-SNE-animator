Using his friendship with Guattari as a guarantor (basing his account of Guattari’s mental state on what went on between them as friends), Bifo undertakes a specious project, specious because based on a proposition that uses the personal as the central figure instead of acknowledging, at the very outset, Guattari’s lifelong investment in the prepersonal and the group subject. In so doing, Bifo backgrounds the operational nature of Guattari’s writing, both alone and with Deleuze. When Bifo suggests, for instance, that their writing on the machinic unconscious is only about “a continuous overcoming,” that their writing refuses “any slowing down and any darkness” he misinterprets, it seems to me, the machinations of desire as outlined in Anti-Oedipus. Anti-Oedipus is not an account of light over darkness, but one of the in-act. The in-act is not positive or negative: it is productive.
