With Nietzsche, with Moten and Harney, with Idle No More, a politics of affirmation makes an appeal that cannot but be heeded. The response to this appeal may be cynical. With cynicism may come critique. And negation. Followed by reconciliation. And identity politics. An affirmative politics will opt against each of these gestures and propose instead a stance that moves with the painful joy that comes with the being born of becoming. It will propose a thinking that moves to the nth power of thought, a thinking ecological to its core, that spreads from the middle, where speciations have not yet resolved into species. This affirmative politics will walk to the improvised tune of an emergent collectivity, a multiplicity replete with gestures that trouble categories, a multiplicity exuberant with fabulations that dance to the power of the false. “We should consider every day lost on which we have not danced at least once. And we should call every truth false which was not accompanied by at least one laugh” (Nietzsche 1977: 332).
