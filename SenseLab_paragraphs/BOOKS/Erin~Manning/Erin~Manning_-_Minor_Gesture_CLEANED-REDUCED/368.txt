This capacity to directly perceive experience in-forming, what I am calling autistic perception, involves a continuous carrying, a moving-with of experience in the making. What if we took this carrying that Blackman feels she has to background for neurotypical consumption and made it the motor of experience? What if we said that carrying is precisely what motivates an experience to become what it can do? What would this approach alter in terms of accounts of agency? How would such an approach give credence to this most lively of modes of perception that is autistic perception?
