Starting with neurodiversity shakes the very foundation these beliefs are built on. Instead of beginning with the self-sustaining individual and a strong belief in selfhood/independence, I therefore begin here. I start with relation, proposing that autistic perception gives us a direct account of relation in-forming, an account that challenges the notion that the world comes parsed. Taking neurodiversity as the point of departure, I suggest that a body is a field-effect in a complex relational milieu that includes the sense of its limits—a body-envelope—but in no way stops there. What if instead of seeing the nonconscious unaligned body-world continuum Kedar describes as something to be overcome, we began the conversation from the perspective of what else a body can do, creating a robust account of the role of nonvolitional or preintentional (nonconscious) expression in the event of life-living? Kedar laments: “It’s that my body finds its own route when my mind can’t find it” (2012: 47). This neurodiverse misalignment with what is defined as conscious intentionality is no doubt frustrating. I don’t want to underestimate that. But what if we took a different perspective on it? What if the path to neurotypical functioning were not the ideal one, the belief that we are the absolute directors of our movements? What if a different account led Kedar to find his motor disturbance helpful in the complex aligning of experience in the making? Are we certain that our “able-bodied” approaches are as ideal as we say they are?
