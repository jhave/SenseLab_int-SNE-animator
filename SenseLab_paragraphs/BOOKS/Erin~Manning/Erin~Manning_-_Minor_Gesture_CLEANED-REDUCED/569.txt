Reactivity does not happen in the event: it happens in the event’s aftermath. It happens in the ways in which the event is taken up, reappropriated. It happens when the event is asked to pay a debt to the world “as we know it.” The becoming-reactive cuts into the in-act. Since the in-act cannot properly be stopped, what occurs is the formation of a double perspective, a second nature, one foot in the world and the other at its edges, as though one could be both outside looking in and in the midst. Since this is not really possible, since the event still agitates (us) no matter what we do, we must deaden it, deny it its potential, undo it of its agility. When this happens the in-act gets backgrounded in the name of the it is. This creates what Spinoza would call sad affects: affects that close the event to its potential. Reactivity is a mechanism of capture.
