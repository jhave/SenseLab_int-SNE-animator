As the postscript will emphasize, a schizoanalytic approach has a belief in the world. In this sense it is Nietzschean: “Was that life? Well then, once more!” (1954: 157). The world it believes in is a world where to act is an inherently affirmative gesture that cannot be distinguished from the in-act of the event. What acts at the heart of the event is the minor gesture. This is not to say that the minor gesture is inherently positive, or good. The minor gesture, like schizoanalysis, is operational. It shifts the field, altering the valence of what comes to be. It is affirmative in its force, emphatic in its belief. Yet it would be to radically misunderstand the cut of difference to ignore the pull of the tragic, as Nietzsche makes clear in drawing a connection between affirmation and tragedy. This is further developed in the postscript.
Deleuze’s words should also be heeded: “It is not the marginal who create the lines; they install themselves on these lines and make them their property, and this is fine when they have that strange modesty of people of the line, the prudence of the experimenter, but it is a disaster when they slip into a black hole from which they no longer utter anything but the microfascist speech of their dependency and their giddiness: ‘We are the avantgarde,’ ‘We are the marginal’” (2007: 139, translation modified). The minor gesture is not the figure of the marginal, though the marginal may carry a special affinity for the minor and wish to compose with it. The minor gesture is the force that makes the lines tremble that compose the everyday, the lines, both structural and fragmentary, that articulate how else experience can come to expression.
