That form is held, to a certain degree, in abeyance. That the chair does not ultimately settle, once and for all in experience, does not mean that the form we know as “chair” is contained in an unreachable elsewhere. The object is the abeyance—the feeling-form (a form felt more than actualized) that cannot be separated out from the milieu, from the field that it co-activates: in this case something like the ecology of comfort, sitability, and desire to sit. Whether the desire to sit errs on the edge of sitability or leans toward plushness of comfort, the experience of chair is never a finite one, it is never contained by the dimensions of the object (or the subject) itself. The object, like the subject, is never it-self.
