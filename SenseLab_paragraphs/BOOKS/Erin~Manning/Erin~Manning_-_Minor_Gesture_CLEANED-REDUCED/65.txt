Bergson’s concept of freedom does not separate out activity from the in-act. In doing so, it radically repositions volition as an aspect of experience, active in the act, no longer the external director of experience mediated. Without a hierarchy of conscious versus nonconscious experience, a more complex compositional field of experience emerges. Here there is still room for mutation, for difference, for an opening toward the asyet-unseen, the as-yet-unthought, the as-yet-unfelt. In these interstices of the as-yet, minor gestures proliferate and can be harnessed toward the reorienting of experience. This is freedom, for Bergson, defined against the usual definition of the free act, which would separate freedom from the in-act, placing freedom side by side with a voluntarist notion of decision. This more typical definition of freedom has us standing outside the event. We are free because we are rational, because we orient the act, because we have agency, because we resist the affective forces of those passions and desires that would steer us in the wrong direction. In this usual definition of freedom, as Bergson says, “we give a mechanical explanation of a fact, and then substitute the explanation for the fact itself ” (2007: 181). This is not the way Bergson conceptualizes freedom. As he writes, “Time is not a line along which one can pass again” and therefore “freedom must be sought in a certain shade or quality of the action itself and not in the relation of this act to what it is not or to what it might have been” (2007: 181–183).
