The register of the minor gesture is always political: in its punctual reorienting of the event, the minor gesture invents new modes of life-living. It moves through the event, creating a pulse, opening the way for new tendencies to emerge, and in the resonances that are awakened, potential for difference looms. This is how I am defining the political: the movement activated, in the event, by a difference in register that awakens new modes of encounter and creates new forms of life-living. Life-living in its usage throughout refuses to privilege this life, this human life, at the expense of different forms and forces of life, even as it recognizes the importance of the punctuality of this singular event we call our life. Life-living is a way of thinking life with and beyond the human, thinking life as more-thanhuman. Deleuzeâ€™s concept of a life resonates strongly here, a life defined in his last ode to living as the flux of liveliness coursing through existence unlimited.16 The conjunction between the minor gesture and life-living is a political ecology that operates on the level of the in-act, asking at every juncture what else life could be. How this singular life-orientation carries existence, and where its minor gestures may lead, is always, for me, a political question.
