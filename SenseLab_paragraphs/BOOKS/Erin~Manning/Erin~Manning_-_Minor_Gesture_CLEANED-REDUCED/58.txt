Because we have little by way of evaluative strategies for the nonvoluntary, because the nonvoluntary resists method, and, in many cases, language, there remains a firm belief that it is of lesser value than conscious, so-called volitional experience. Yet nonconscious experience is full of knowledge: it is, after all, the site of decision. No decision, as mentioned above, is made outside the eventâ€™s welling.24 Both Carl Schmitt and Whitehead, in their different ways, emphasize that decision is the cut that opens the event to a new field of relation, not the act that precedes or follows the event. Decision is not what happens after the affective opening of the event to its potential, but what cleaves the event, in the event. The minor gesture is a decisional cut.
