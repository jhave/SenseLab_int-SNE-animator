I want to begin here, in the midst of a paradoxical experience where on the one hand there is difficulty as regards initiation and follow-through, where there are real challenges with communication and body-movement alignment, and on the other hand there is an acute richness of relational intensity that facilitates a perhaps more complex encounter with the world in-forming. From this perspective, where bodies are often not yet—“If I have my eyes closed I don’t know where my hands are” (Kedar 2012: 81)— it would be easy to simply suggest, as Kedar often does, that there is something profoundly lacking that must be rectified. Kedar certainly thinks so: “My exercising is helping me to feel [my body] more. My body is beginning to connect more to my brain. I’m determined to overcome this challenge” (2012: 81). But as the above paradox makes apparent, this is not an all-or-nothing proposition. Certainly, I fully support and understand the importance for Kedar and other autistics to design techniques that make neurotypically inclined existence easier to navigate. But this does not preclude valuing aspects of autistic experience that tend to be undervalued (even by autistics). And so this is where I start, in the midst of the uneasy body-world relation Kedar describes.
