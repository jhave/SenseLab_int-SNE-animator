To activate its artfulness, the object must be capable of more than its initial transduction from the everyday into the gallery. It must continue to vary and its variation must be serial, in the sense that each object-variation must remain lively with the incipient memory and the imperceptible traces of its passage from one site to another, the sites not only physical, but also conceptual, sites of memory, of anticipation, of attunement. Across the series, in the iteration that tunes from the multiple to multiplicity, a tension appears that makes felt the complexity not of number but of multiplicity as a variation on itself. All becoming, as Deleuze and Guattari write, is minoritarian, and all becoming is rife with the tension that comes with variation. How can the gallery setting imbue the object with the same kind of internal variability?
