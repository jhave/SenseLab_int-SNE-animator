To place facilitation in the relation means that the facilitator must become aware of the more-than of experience informing. It is this more-than that the facilitator-autistic relation will field. Carrying is key here. The facilitator must also become active in the carrying that occurs across fields of difference, from edge to language, from intensity to form. Facilitation is therefore something that the autistic and the facilitator must learn together. Theirs is a sociality for two.
