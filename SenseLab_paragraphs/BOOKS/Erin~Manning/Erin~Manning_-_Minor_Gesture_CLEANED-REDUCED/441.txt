Autie-type is a rhythm all its own. Ralph Savarese sees this poetic voice as a starting point for creating a bridge between the autistic and the neurotypical. He writes: Poetry might constitute a linguistic meeting point for different neurological types, one that honours both the “unlost instinct” (or pure sensory knowing) of autistics and the symbolic proclivities of neurotypicals. The sensual splendour of the world, to which classical autistics are so attentive, shows up by analogy in poetry. Patterned syntax and sound, pulsating rhythm, emotional prosody as a function of tone— these things might induce non-literate autistics to grapple with poetry’s semantic content and, thus, functional language in general. In turn, neurotypicals might be restored to their sensing bodies, and as a result, better understand the sensory world of autistics. Each half of the neurological divide would commit itself to an ethic of neuro-cosmopolitanism. Each would concede the need for repair. (2012: 210)
