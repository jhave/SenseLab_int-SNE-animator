What is intuited is not matter per se: “There is therefore no intuition of matter, of life, of society in and of themselves, that is, as nouns” (Lapoujade 2010: 56). There is intuition of forces, of qualities that escape the superficial interrogation of that which has already taken its place. Intuition is always and only compelled by what is on its way.
