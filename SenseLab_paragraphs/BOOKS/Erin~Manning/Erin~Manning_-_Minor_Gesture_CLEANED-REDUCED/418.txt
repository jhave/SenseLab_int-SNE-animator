For James, the feeling of effort is less connected to a specific tissue or muscle mass in the body than to the field of experience. The feeling of effort, like the percept above, creates the function. “Our motions are the ends of our seeing,” writes James. “The marksman thinks only of the exact position of the goal, the singer only of the perfect sound, the balancer only of the point in space whose oscillations he must counteract by movement, . . . each variation in the thought of the end . . . functionally correlated with the one movement fitted to bring the latter about” (1969: 156). It is the terminus that activates the sequencing which, as James underlines above, “now proves itself to be what the concept ‘had in mind’” (1969: 61). Movement folds through movement, its parsing activated not by a volition occurring outside the event, but by the very flow of movement-moving nonconsciously coursing through the pull of the terminus.
