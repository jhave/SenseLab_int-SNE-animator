What would it mean to become aware, for instance, of how a lack of accommodation impedes the dance of attention of an event from being felt? What might it mean to make accommodation, seen as a collective engagement that tends fields of relation, a central concern of the everyday, in all instances, at all times, including accommodation in the strictest physical, architectural sense, but also accommodation to neurodiverse forms of perception and attention? The absence of a robust engagement with accommodation has to do with a practiced ignorance of the complexity of differentials at the heart of speciations. Elsewhere I have argued that this practiced ignorance is at the heart of neurotypical identity politics and its unwavering belief in the volition-intentionalityagency triad.
