In Kedarâ€™s case the movement of thought is not the problem. The problem is in the making-conscious of this movement, in the subtraction from the field of relation to the actual occasion. The field is simply too complex to easily pull out of it one single thought-activity. What makes it so complex is the movement in it. A body trained to subtract, to parse, is a body that has learned to find a certain stillness in, and believes it can differentiate itself from, the commotion of the ecologies that compose experience.
