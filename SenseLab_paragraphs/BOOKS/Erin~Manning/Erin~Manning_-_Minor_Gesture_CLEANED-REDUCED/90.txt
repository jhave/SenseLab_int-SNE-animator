The question of the anarchic share of existence is key here. What is it that creates the conditions for “the adventure of living better?” Whitehead asks (1929: 19). The adventure of living better is achieved through the tightrope of a constant realignment of the anarchic and the cut of actualization. Reason is not simply the pull toward the categorization that comes with forms of definiteness. It is the active differential at play in the between of anarchy and organization. Reason, as Whitehead defines it, is a decisional force that remains operative precisely because it carries the more-than of the anarchic. Method, on the other hand, allied as it is with the more Kantian definition of reason, is a cut that stills. Method stops potential on its way, cutting into the process before it has had a chance to fully engage with the complex relational fields the process itself calls forth. As Whitehead so forcefully writes: “The birth of a methodology” is “in its essence the discovery of a dodge to live” (1929: 18). He continues: Each methodology has its own life history. It starts as a dodge facilitating the accomplishment of some nascent urge of life. In its prime, it represents some wide coordination of thought and action whereby this urge expresses itself as a major satisfaction of existence. Finally it enters upon the lassitude of old age, its second childhood. The larger contrasts attainable within the scope of the method have been explored and familiarized. The satisfaction from repetition has faded away. Life then faces the last alternatives in which its fate depends. . . . When any methodology of life has exhausted the novelties within its scope and played upon them up to the incoming of fatigue, one final decision determines the fate of a species. It can stabilize itself, and relapse so as to live; or it can shake itself free, and enter upon the adventure of living better. (1929: 18–19)
