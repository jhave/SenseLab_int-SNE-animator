When experience resists external organization according to a metrics of time, the linearity of language’s enunciation is invariably affected. The experience is that of words blurring, of the impossibility of composing a thought that will survive articulation. As I discussed in the last chapter in relation to autie-type, for the autistic, especially one on the classical end of the spectrum, where motricity is affected such that vocal cords cannot be properly located to permit speech, or where impulse control makes it difficult to direct speech toward what the autistic wants to say, language comes slowly, finger by finger, on the keyboard. But it also comes slowly experientially, moving around images that are closer to metaphors (metamorphoses) than direct statements. As autistic Larry Bissonnette writes: “Typing is like letting your finger hit keys with accuracy. Leniency on that is not tolerated. Am easily language impaired. Artmaking is like alliance people develop with their muscles after deep massage. You can move freely without effort” (in Savarese 2012: 184).
