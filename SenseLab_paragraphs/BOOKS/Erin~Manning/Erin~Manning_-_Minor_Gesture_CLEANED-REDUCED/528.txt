To experience the world in its shape-shifting alerts us to the realness of relation and connects to a more-than-human horizon, I think. It allows us to think ecologically, from the middle. And from there, there is an opening to the felt expression of thought-in-the-moving, to language’s prelinguistic expressions—what I have elsewhere called prearticulation—to the complex rhythms of what lies between the conscious and the nonconscious at the interstices of the human and the nonhuman, the more-than-human.
AB: So how I understand you is that it is not enough to speak only in the name of the other things, but really to change, or to open up a space in which another form of relationality with other nonhuman things becomes possible. So it is not only a matter of language and a matter of morality to take care of other nonhuman things, and give them a voice, but to work on the level of affection, of affect, of being affected, of what you and Brian also called tendencies which show up in relation to others and to change our behaviors. Or, as you beautifully said before, to care for the event.
