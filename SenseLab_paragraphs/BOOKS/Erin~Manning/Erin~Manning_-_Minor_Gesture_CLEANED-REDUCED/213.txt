When speaking of minor literature, Deleuze and Guattari begin with the proposition that what characterizes minor literatures is that “everything in them is political” (1986: 17). What they mean by this is that the minor gesture is always already a collective expression, collective in the sense that it emboldens the art of participation. Against the major tendency of seeking mastery, the minor gesture pulls the potential at the heart of a process into a mobile field replete with force-imbued-material that is capable of making felt not only what the process can do but how the ecology of which it is part resonates through and across it. Always alive with a certain quality of transduction, the process clinched by a minor gesture is one that makes the threshold between process and object/effect felt.
