There is the grand gesture of reconciliation, and then of course there are the minor gestures that push through the process and move it in ways unchoreographed. The Truth and Reconciliation hearings, by all accounts, were replete with such minor gestures. Many First Nations people who testified speak of the healing that ensued from the act of sharing. Vincent Yellow Old Woman puts it this way: “Now that we’ve acknowledged it, we’re beginning to deal with it. And then we can work together on how to move forward.”6 But what changes in the process does not change thanks to the grand gesture. What changes does so because another movement begins to affect the field, a movement harder to pinpoint, a movement less allied to the either/or, good/evil narrative of Harper’s speech. It does so because it acknowledges that reconciliation means an infinity of things in the context of colonization, many of these impossible to account for, impossible to count. No grand gesture can settle the score. There is no simple “first” cut that can be magically healed. The conditions can only be shifted through minor gestures that make the field more pliable, more fertile for the sort of planning Moten and Harney see as key to the undercommons.
