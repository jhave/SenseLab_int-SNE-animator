Sympathy is a strange term for this process, so connected is it in our everyday language with the sense of applying a value-judgment to a preexisting process. It may therefore not hold the power as a concept to make felt the force of what it does, or can do. I use it here as an ally to concepts such as concern and self-enjoyment in Whitehead, concepts that remind us that the event has a concern for its own evolution, and that this concern is key to the event outdoing itself. To make sympathy the driver of expression in the event is to bring care into the framework of an event’s concrescence, to foreground how intuition is a relational act that plays itself out in an ecology that cannot be abstracted from it. Intuition leads to sympathy— sympathy for the event in its unfolding. Without sympathy for the unfolding, the event cannot make felt the complexity of durations of which it is composed. Sympathy tends to the complexity of an intuition that lurks at the very edge of thought where the rhythms that populate the event have not yet moved into their constellatory potential.
