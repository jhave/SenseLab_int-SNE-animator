“Credit keeps track. Debt forgets” (Moten and Harney 2013: 62). A shared debt would be a debt forgotten, a debt that forgets itself. It would be what Moten and Harney call bad debt. Debt forgotten is bad because its point of inception can no longer be traced. It exists in the world in a way that does not lead back to the individual.
