Several decades ago, Félix Guattari faced similar questions. Having gone through a lengthy analysis with Jacques Lacan and having himself entered the field of psychiatry, he began to ask himself whether the models at hand would be capable of supporting (let alone creating) new modes of existence. “From the start, psychoanalysis tried to make sure that its categories were in agreement with the normative models of the period,” he writes (1984: 85). Everywhere around him, the emphasis was on language. What of the modes of articulation, he wondered, that precede or exceed language? What about modes of subjectivity that cannot be made sense of through the split between subject and object, analyst and analysand? And, in thinking against method, how might we get beyond transference, the keystone of psychoanalysis, itself such a powerful model? “Regardless of the particular psychoanalytic curriculum, a reference to a pre-determined model of normality remains implicit within its framework. The analyst, of course, does not in principle expect that this normalization is the product of a pure and simple identification of the analysand with the analyst, but it works no less, and even despite him . . . as a process of identification of the analysand with a human profile that is compatible with the existing social order” (in Genosko 1996: 65–66).
