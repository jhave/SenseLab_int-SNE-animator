In an interview between autistic Tito Mukhopadhyay and Ralph Savarese, Mukhopadhyay explains how poetry figures in his writing practice. “I use verse when I get bored of writing a dragging paragraph. I usually do. Sometimes the topic becomes too thick and intense to write. I get nagged by this boring state that the topic holds for me. Because of that, I seek a way out to recharge my senses. A verse makes me free. A verse recharges my senses. And a verse can distract the eyes and ears of a reader. It is easy to read it that way” (Savarese 2010). Poetry, for Mukhopadhyay, is both a way of coming into language and remaining in the world of words, of growing words alongside perception in the making.
