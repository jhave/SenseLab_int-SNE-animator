The question of the in-act, of activist philosophy, of the becomingactive, is tied to quality-as-difference. Quality as difference is opposed to quality that succumbs too quickly to measure. Such quality is in the service of quantity: it serves only to qualify the it is. When quality is perceived only from the perspective of what can be measured, quality is limited to the pregiven realm of what can be accounted for in advance. This is apparent in stereotyping. When we speak, for instance, of the litheness of a dancer, the assumption is that all dancers are lithe. Quality is here more a framing
device than an open orientation. The quality of litheness is held together by the preestablished notion not only of what a dancer is, but also of what litheness means in the context of a body predisposed to dancing. Litheness becomes a way of reifying the allure of a dancing body, thereby reducing both litheness and the dancing body to a set of predictable figures (thinness, able-bodiedness, youth). This puts quality at the service of quantity, limiting the force both of what the dancing body can do and how litheness might correspond to this doing. There are of course an infinity of ways this relation could play out, beyond measure, beyond stereotype. But for this to happen, quality would have to be affirmed beyond its relation to form. Form would have to become the afterthought of how quality lands, this time, this way. Quality as activated in the affirmation is not yet contained by a preexisting relation. The quality of affirmation is beyond measure. It operates, it tunes and attunes, it orients, but it does not set up the frame in advance. Litheness without a subject takes on a completely different sense, opening itself to an emergent shaping that does not yet know how to take hold, how to become-form. The dancing body is invented in affirmation, not reified.
