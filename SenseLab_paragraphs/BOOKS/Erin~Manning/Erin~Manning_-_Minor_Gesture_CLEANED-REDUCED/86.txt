In working as an apparatus of capture, method gives reason its place in the sun: it diagnoses, it situates, it organizes, and ultimately it surveys and judges. Methods, we hear, are ever-changing, and this is surely the case. But any ordering agenda that organizes from without is still active in the exclusion of processes too unintelligible within current understandings of knowledge to be recognized, let alone studied or valued. Despite its best intentions, method works as the safeguard against the ineffable: if something cannot be categorized, it cannot be made to account for itself and is cast aside as irrelevant. The consequences are many: knowledge tends to be relegated to the sphere of “conscious knowledge,” backgrounding the wealth of the relational field of experience in-forming; the force of change that animates a process is deadened; the uneasiness that destabilizes thinking is backgrounded or effaced completely.
A standardized methodological approach begins to unravel if we ask not how knowledge can be organized, but what knowledge does. This radically empirical question is at the heart of Whitehead’s 1929 book A Function of Reason. What at first reads as a very strange account of reason, where reason is defined in relation to appetition and the more-than, The Function of Reason is an extraordinary feat of recontextualizing method beyond what Whitehead suggests is its superficial ordering of knowledge (1929: 10). Critical at its core of Kant’s notion of reason and indebted both to Plato and Ulysses—“the one shares Reason with the Gods, the other shares it with the foxes” (1929: 10)—The Function of Reason is a book I return to every time I want to rethink the way study can orient and invent movements of thought.
