Participation is key to the art of time. In the oed’s normative account of art as object, art has two times: the time of making, and the time of the spectator’s appreciation of that making. Maker and spectator are the two limits of the process. While this account is complicated in participatory art and in collective artistic processes of all kinds, the question remains: to what degree does art retain this original dichotomy between maker and spectator/public/participant even in the cases where the participatory aspect of the work is absolutely central to what makes the work work? To what degree does the maker continue to see themselves as the central pivot (or to what degree does the curator still see the maker as the central pivot)? To what degree do we continue to hold onto the idea of the artist as solitary genius?
When a process is delimited by the belief that there is a preexisting individual creating at its center, the collective becomes an afterthought. The participatory is left to the end, and with this, a decisive stage of the event is muted. In segregating participation from the work, in making participation the afterthought of a practice already under way, what we do is set apart integral aspects of a process. The real work is seen as that which emerges before the event opens to the public. Practice thus separates itself from techniques for activation. When this happens, the participatory is set up in an uneasy dichotomy between what becomes the inside and the outside of a process. An expectation emerges that places the public in a position of uneasy judgment.
