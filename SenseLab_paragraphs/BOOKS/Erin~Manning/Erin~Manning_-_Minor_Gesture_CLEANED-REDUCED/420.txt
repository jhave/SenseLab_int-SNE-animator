Termini—or motor ideas—are infinite and variable. The terminus is not one movement, one object reached-toward, but a region of variation. For the neurotypical, whose ability to parse-in-movement is more available than it is for the autistic, the parsing can seem projective, and therefore voluntary. The apple rests in the hand because there was the intention to take the apple off the counter. But how many times have you landed at the refrigerator with the door open and wondered what you were there for? How many times have you wandered around the bedroom looking for your reading glasses, the ones hanging around your neck? Movement only seems voluntary in the neurotypically inflected reflective consciousness because it connects with what the concept had in mind to the degree that there is a lack of feeling of effort. It all seems straightforward, you think, as you bring the apple to your mouth. The movement comes from me.
