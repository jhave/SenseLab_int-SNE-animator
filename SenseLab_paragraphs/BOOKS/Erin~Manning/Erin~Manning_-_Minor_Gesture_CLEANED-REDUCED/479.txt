In my own struggle with depression, it has become clear to me that what we call depression is nothing if not plural: it expresses itself in an infinity of ways from sadness to hunger, from loss to anguish and anxiety, from a frenetically quiet inner panic to a full-fledged panic attack, from the stillness of a body incapable of moving to an agitated body. For some, all of these tendencies are present, which leads depression to be less about a state that could properly be described than a terrible decalibration that makes it impossible to compose with the world: everything feels out of sync. This is the case for me: the experience is one of not being able to connect to the movements that surround me, not being able to match their rhythms. The best description of this is a sense of misalignment with time. The world moves too quickly or too slowly in ways that are difficult to connect to. It is as though there were multiple speeds and slownesses in continuous unalignable disjunction. Medicated, and with many years of various kinds of treatments, the sense I have is that it has become easier to align and that the field of relation now stabilizes enough to allow a co-composition across worldings. I can participate. But the one who participates is not a personalized “I.” It is a schizo-I, like Deleuze’s account of “Pierre” and “Félix,” a schizo anti-I in the sense that there is no absolute integration, but instead an emergent potential for co-composition across experiential time both quick and slow. Living with depression, and acknowledging the necessity for facilitation in its many relational guises, is an art of participation, and what has emerged through this art of participation is a belief in the world as a mobile site to which alignments are possible.
