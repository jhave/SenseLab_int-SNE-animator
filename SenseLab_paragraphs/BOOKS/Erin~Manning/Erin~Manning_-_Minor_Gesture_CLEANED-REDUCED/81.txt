When something does, new relational fields are forming, and with them, new modes of existence. A new mode of existence brings with it modalities of knowledge. These modalities of knowledge are not yet circumscribed— they are transversal to the modes of operation active in the relational field. They are still in-act. This is the force of radical empiricism: it gives us a technique to work with the in-act at the heart of experience, providing subtle ways of composing with the shifting relations between knower and known. It is important to reiterate: the knower is not the human subject, but the way relations open themselves toward systems of subjectification.5 Similar to Whitehead’s notion of the “superject”—which emphasizes that the occasion of experience is itself what proposes its knower-known relations, resulting in a subject that is the subject of the experience rather than a subject external to the experience—radical empiricism refutes the notion that experience is constituted before all else of human relations. In Whitehead’s terms: “An actual entity is at once the subject experiencing and the superject of its experiences” (1978: 43). An occasion of experience produces the means by which it will eventually define itself as this or that. It is an occasion of experience, not the human subject external to that experience, that creates the conditions for subjectivity, a subjectivity that can never be disentangled from how the event came to fruition. A radically empirical approach takes this as its starting point, giving us the means to consider how relations themselves field experience.
