Artfulness has no use-value—it does nothing that can be mapped onto a process already under way. It has no end point, no preordained limits, no moral codes. But it is conditioning. To say that a process is conditioning is to say that the enabling constraints of its emergence continue to facilitate a propitious engagement with the problem at hand, enabling the passage toward a field that yields. A practice does its work when this yield—already present in germ in the initial problem that activated its process, in the intuition that tapped into how technique might become technicity—is made operational by a minor gesture. Without propitious conditions, the aesthetic does not yield, and the work or event cannot become in excess of the techniques that brought it into being.
