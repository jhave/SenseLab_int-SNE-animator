Deleuze sometimes speaks of the art of time as essence. Essence here has nothing to do with a stable quality. In his early work on Proust, Deleuze speaks of essence as the force of the as-yet-unfelt in experience. Essence is here everything it usually isn’t: it is not truth, or origin. Essence is the ultimate difference in kind. Linked to art, essence for Deleuze speaks of the unquantifiable in experience, of that which exceeds the equivalence between sign and sense. “At the deepest level, the essential is in the signs of art” (1972: 13).
