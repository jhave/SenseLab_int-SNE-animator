The minor gesture is an operative cut that opens experience to its potential. This operation is affirmative to its core—it affirms the field in its transformation, and it affirms the way this transformation emboldens the in-act of experience in the making. Affirmation is the creative force of a reorientation in the event. What affirmation does, how it effects the cut, is what gives it affective valence in the event. The affirmative cut of the minor gesture catalyzes a reordering. Cuts are not good or bad. It is what they do that makes a difference. The affirmative cut is not the bestowing of a value judgment onto experience. Affirmation is not good or evil, optimistic or cruel.1 Nietzschean affirmation counters the Hegelian dialectic. Where the dialectic builds on contradiction and opposition, affirmation refuses to stand against. Critique is not its motor, but neither is acceptance. Affirmation does not do its work according to the either-or of a field predetermined. Nor does it seek to counter (or accept) the it is of the given. Cutting into the event is not a process of negation or dialectical synthesis. Affirmation moves at the pace of the differential, aligning to the event’s points of inflection, to its operative tangents, where the form of experience has not yet
quite emerged.
