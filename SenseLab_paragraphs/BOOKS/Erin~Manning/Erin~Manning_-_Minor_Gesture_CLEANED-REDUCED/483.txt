Neurodiversity is about accepting that there is no normal human brain, that being different is okay, and about working together to discover how we all can participate to the best of our abilities in our lives. We are optimistic that with the proper supports and accommodations, positive attitudes, acceptance, inclusion, and encouragement, that every (autistic) person is able to communicate, interact, and contribute to society while meeting individual needs and respecting one’s sense of self and personal rights.3
It is very common for autistics to suffer from the disabling anxiety that is on the spectrum of what is treated as depression. It is also very often asserted by autistics that they have a strange sense of time: “Time perception in autism spectrum disorder is a part of the complexity of the condition. Many people with autism experience fragmented or delayed time perception, which can present challenges to social interaction and learning.”4 What I want to do by aligning the autistic’s perception of time to the perception of time in the wide array of depressive disorders is not to suggest that we are all autistic, or that all autistics are depressed, but to return to neurodiversity to think about the complexity of experience. In doing so, I want to turn once more to the concept of autistic perception to explore how depression—as the experience of time’s differential—is itself on the continuum of autistic perception. This, I hope, will open the way for an alignment between autistic perception and schizoanalysis.
