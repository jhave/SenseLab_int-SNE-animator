To move the interval, the more-than, rather than “the body,” or “the subject,” is to create an opening for a politics that doesn’t begin with or settle into form, a politics that invents with the inframodality of a makingthinking that refuses to know in advance what it can become. Traditionally, political philosophy does not make space for the interval within the vocabulary of the political subject (or its adjacent concept, the body-politic), yet the interval has nonetheless leaked into the complex iterations of experience we call the political.18 What a focus on movement can do is bring to the fore the potential of a different perspective, one that leads away from a humanist bias that builds on intention and volition toward the complex intervals of an ecological world in motion.
