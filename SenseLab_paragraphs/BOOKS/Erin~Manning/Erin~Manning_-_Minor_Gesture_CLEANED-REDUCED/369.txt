Following the work of the last chapter, which explored the role of inflection, relation, and the interval in movement in order to foreground the nonconscious share of movement-moving, linking it to an activist philosophy that is neurodiverse at its core, I want to expand the account of volition here to ask how carrying takes us further outside of the model of the neurotypical. I want to suggest that there is, in Blackmanâ€™s account of orbital subjectivity, and in many other accounts of autistic perception, a kind of carrying of mobility that resituates experience beyond the reigning body/world dichotomy.
