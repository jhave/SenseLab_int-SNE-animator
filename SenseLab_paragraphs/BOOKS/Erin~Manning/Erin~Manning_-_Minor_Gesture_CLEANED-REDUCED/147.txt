This way is relational. It is of the field, in the milieu. Art: the intuitive process for activating the relational composition that is life-living, for creating a memory of the future that evades, that complicates form. The art of time: making felt the rhythm of the differential, the quality of relation. It is not a question, once again, of slow time, or quick time, of lingering or speeding. It is a question of moving experience beyond the way it has a habit of taking, of discovering how the edges of life-living commingle with the force of that which cannot yet be perceived, but is nonetheless felt. The art of time involves taking a risk, no doubt, but risk played out differently, at the level not of identity or being: risk of losing our footing, risk of the world losing its footing, on a ground that moves and keeps moving. Here, in the crafting of an undercommons where movement predates form, where expression remains lively at the interstices of the ineffable, the field of relation itself becomes “inventor of new possibilities of life,” possibilities of life we can only intuit in the art of time (Nietzsche 1996: 3).
