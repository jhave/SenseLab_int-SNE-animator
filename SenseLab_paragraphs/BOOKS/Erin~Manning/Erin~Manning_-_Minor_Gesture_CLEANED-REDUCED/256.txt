For Kawakubo, what is at stake is making itself, not the making of the object. The object does not define the purpose and cannot be subsumed to it. What she strives toward is the creation of a series of enabling constraints for each process, constraints that, in the best-case scenario, are procedural enough to create new modes of existence. Hers is a procedural fashioning: each new process invents procedures that push the very idea of what a garment can be to its limit. Kawakubo seeks not the final form, not the production of a neutral layer for a preexisting body, but the creation of a
propositional field that activates what a body can do in its co-constitution with an emergent environment.
