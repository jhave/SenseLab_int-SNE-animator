“Break the idea of clothes” has been Rei Kawakubo’s call for over forty years, a call that has motivated the creation of some of the most intriguing clothing of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, opening up the field of fashion to an architectural potential perhaps unprecedented. With Rei Kawakubo’s insistence that clothes are not a predetermined category, but a proposition according to which a body is invited to continuously reinvent itself, she has led the way toward a textile-based architecting of experience. In this regard, Kawakubo has pushed and continues to push the Spinozist mantra “we know not what a body can do” to its limit, recasting not only the realm of fashion but the way fashion situates itself in relation to other practices, especially that of architecture.
