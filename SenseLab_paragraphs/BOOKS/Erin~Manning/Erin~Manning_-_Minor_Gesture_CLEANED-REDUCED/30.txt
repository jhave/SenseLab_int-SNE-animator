In The Undercommons, Moten and Harney foreground the university as an institutional system that, in the neoliberal economy, thrives on a belief that knowledge can be encapsulated and marketed. There is no question that this tendency has become more marked in the last decades, with funding for the humanities, social sciences, the theoretical sciences, and studio arts (to name only the most obvious examples) continuously under threat due to their so-called uselessness in the economic marketplace. With the increased pressure of bringing funds to the university through grant-writing comes the generalization of knowledge and the emphasis on disciplinary framing. The shift looks something like this: in order to get grants, scholars and artists within the university are asked to frame their own work according to perceived use-value (read: grantvalue). This tends to hierarchize certain forms of knowledge over others, though these hierarchies can turn around quite quickly, given the mobility of capital. Paired with the increased financial instability of the university, which leads to fewer positions being created and thus fewer differences within the ranks, this can have the effect of narrowing knowledge to what are perceived to be the needs of the discipline (now redefi d according to granting categories), often acting against the very openings learning can facilitate.
