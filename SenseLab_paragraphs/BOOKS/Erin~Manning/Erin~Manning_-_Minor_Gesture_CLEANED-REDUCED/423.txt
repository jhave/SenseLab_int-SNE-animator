This is similar to what happens with autistics. When Naoki Higashida writes, “We are outside the normal flow of time, we can’t express ourselves, and our bodies are hurtling us through life,” what he is suggesting, it seems to me, is that life’s pull, the complexity of the field of activity of autistic perception, is so strong that he often has trouble feeling the sense of a single directionality within it (2013: loc. 583). The agencement of potential as region is simply too strong, and with it, the motor ideas or termini simply too diverse. And so he jogs and walks “to refresh” his body, and “once refreshed, I kind of feel back home within myself. My sense of gravity is restored, and that calms me down” (2013: loc. 688). Like Blackman’s touch, Naoki Higashida’s running quiets down the field of sensation, and with this quietening, the pull of the field into a single tendency comes more clearly to attention. Here, momentarily, a sense of agency is felt. But this is not subject-oriented agency. It is agency in the event, agency facilitated by the conditions of this singular field of experience coming into itself just this way. The agencement moves the event in a way that makes attention field in conformity with it. When we speak of not “paying attention,” when we accuse autistics or anyone else of not being attentive, we are often undervaluing the complex modalities attending, in the event, to experience in the making.
