Dramatization is the operation through which a will affirms itself. What dramatization does is reveal the dynamic nature of the field of relation. Dramatization is the motor of differentiation. It is what moves the event toward its pragmatic singularization, asking not “what is” but “in which case, who, how, how much?” (Deleuze 2002: 101). “What are the forces which take hold of a given thing, what is the will that possesses it? Which one is expressed, manifested and even hidden in it?” (Deleuze 2002: 77).
This “tragic method” is tragic because it does not know in advance how difference will be affirmed. It is joyful because it activates an eternal mobility, a mobility alive with difference: the eternal return, a spiraling that never eats its tail.
