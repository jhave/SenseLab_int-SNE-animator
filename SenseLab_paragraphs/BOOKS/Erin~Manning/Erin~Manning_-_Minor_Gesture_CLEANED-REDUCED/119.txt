Such an approach to knowledge in the making can be said to be schizoanalytic. Guattari explains: With respect to schizoanalysis . . . it is clear that it cannot pose itself as a general method which would embrace the ensemble of problems and new social practices. . . . Without pretending to promote a didactic program, it is a matter of constituting networks and rhizomes in order to escape the systems of modelization in which we are entangled and which are in the process of completely polluting us, heart and mind. . . . At base, schizoanalysis only poses one question: “how does one model oneself ?” . . . Schizoanalysis . . . is not an alternative modelization. It is a metamodelization. It tries to understand how it is that you got where you are. “What is your model to you?” It does not work?—Then, I don’t know, one tries to work together. . . . There is no question of posing a standard model. And the criterion of truth in this comes precisely when the metamodeling transforms itself into self-modeling [automodalisation], or self-management [auto-gestion], if you prefer.
