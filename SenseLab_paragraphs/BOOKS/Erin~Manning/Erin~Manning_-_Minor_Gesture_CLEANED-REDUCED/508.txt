This is where Bifo gets it wrong, it seems to me, positing as he does desire as a counterpoint to depression or panic. He writes: The process of subjectivation is based on conditions that have dramatically changed in the forty years since the publication of Deleuze and Guattariâ€™s Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia. Reading that book was a defining moment in my intellectual and political experience, in the first years of the 1970s, when students and workers were fighting and organizing spaces of autonomy and separation from capitalist exploitation. Forty years after the publication of that book the landscape has changed so deeply that the very concept of desire has to be re-thought, as it is marking the field of subjectivation in a very different way.
