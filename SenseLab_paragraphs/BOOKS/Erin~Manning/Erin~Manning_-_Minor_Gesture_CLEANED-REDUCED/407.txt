This common belief that facilitation and self-expression are counter to one another is compounded by the fact that studies of autistic language done by neuroscientists, for instance, see it as a necessity to segregate autistics from their facilitators during the experiment, thereby underscoring the accepted belief that true language emerges independently of another person. The result is that autistics tend to grow language always with an overhanging belief imposed from the outside that the language will only truly be theirs if they can write in a vacuum. Not only does this completely undermine the notion of how relation activates the complexity of experience, it also comes with another dangerâ€”that autistics may lose the poetic voice that emerges with facilitation.
