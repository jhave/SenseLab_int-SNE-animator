Artfulness emerges most actively in the interstices where the world has not yet settled into objects and subjects. One lively environment for artfulness is the field of direct perception I defined in the introduction as autistic perception. When there is artfulness, it is because conditions have been created that enable not only the art of time, but also the art of participation. Autistic perception, the direct participation, in the event, of its welling ecologies, is perhaps the most open register for the experience of the artful. For it is only when there is sympathy for the complexity of the welling event that the more-than of an emergent ecology can truly be perceived. When this happens, a shift is felt toward a sense of immanent movement—and the way at the heart of art is felt. It is not the object that stands out here, not the tree or the sunset or a painting. It is the force of immanent movement the event calls forth that is experienced, a mobility in the making that displaces any discrete notion of subjectivity or objecthood. This does not mean that what is opened up is without a time, a place, a history. Quite the contrary: what emerges at the heart of the artful in the rhythmic time of autistic perception is always singular—this process, this ecology, this feeling. It is how the constellation of emergent factors co-compose, how they are felt in their emergence, that make this singular event artful, an artfulness that will then, in retrospect, carry a history, a commitment to a cause, mobilizing a politics in the making.
