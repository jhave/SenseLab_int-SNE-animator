But technique on its own is not enough. The technique will only open the field, altering the conditions of its emergence. What is also needed is a minor gesture that is capable of tuning technique to what I call its technicity. Think of ballet, for instance. Through repetitive techniques—including practicing for hours at the barre, honing flexibility in the joints through daily stretching, practicing jumps over and over again to create better balance, repeating particular forms daily—a body will begin to become a ballet-body. Hips will open in a way that will allow for a diversity of movement quite unusual for most standing bodies, toes and feet will become accustomed to the pain of pointe shoes if they are used, the extension of limbs in the predictable orientations of a ballet-aesthetic will become second nature. But these shifts in the dancing body won’t by themselves be enough to make a dancer really dance. What will make the dancer dance is technicity, the outdoing of technique, the capacity to take technique to its limit, and then to go elsewhere.
