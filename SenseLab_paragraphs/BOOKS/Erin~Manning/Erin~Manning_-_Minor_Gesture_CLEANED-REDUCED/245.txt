Despite the focus in Arakawa and Ginsâ€™s work on the necessity to break habit, to open experience to invention and surprise, there is nonetheless in their work an attentiveness to what else habit can do. For habit, as both Arakawa and Gins and Kawakubo recognize, is a mutable force. Habit directs our movements, constraining other tendencies. These other tendencies, constrained as they are, can be said to still be operative in germ at the heart of habit. The challenge is to make these minor tendencies operational, thereby opening habit to its subtle multiplicity and exposing the fact that habit was never quite as stable as it seemed.
