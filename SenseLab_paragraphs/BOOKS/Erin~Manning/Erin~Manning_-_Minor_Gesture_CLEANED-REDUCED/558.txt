And is this cycle not, despite its urgency, reactive? In operating so firmly against, does this cycle not also deintensify the not-yet of experience in the making? Moten continues: “They want an acknowledgement of the debt because it constitutes something like a form of recognition, and that becomes very problematic because the form of recognition that they want is within an already existing system. They want to be recognized by sovereignty as sovereign, in a certain sense” (2013: 152). The debt, as framed by ressentiment becomes the credit that keeps a certain version of life going. A debt remains to be paid, a debt the future cannot rectify. Debt creates a cycle we resent. This cycle is what is familiar, safe in its predictability, and so we continue to dwell in its closed loop, even though it makes us miserable. We’d like to move on, to be elsewhere, but the threshold of past to present always seems to open to the same conditions of indebtedness. If only we could get rid of that debt, we know we would feel better. If only we could get enough credit. Nietzschean affirmation energizes that threshold. It creates the conditions for another way of entering, another way of walking. A different path reveals itself. The affirmative path is rocky and unsteady. No well-trodden ruts here. This path doesn’t know where it’s headed. It promises nothing. It gives no credit, and repays no debt. This is what affirmation knows: credit is what keeps us indebted. “They say we have too much debt. We need better credit, more credit, less spending. They offer us credit repair, credit counseling, microcredit, personal financial planning. They promise to match credit and debt again, debt and credit. But our debts stay bad” (Moten and Harney 2013: 61).
