That Kawakubo’s creations are sculptural is well known, but they are also more than that. They are what Madeline Gins and Arakawa would call procedural architectures. Procedural architectures are propositional: it is what they can do that is foregrounded. To say that fashion is architectural is often to speak of it in representational terms. Despite the visible architectonics of Kawakubo’s designs, to focus solely on their form would be reductive: Kawakubo’s textile creations function architecturally in ways that far exceed representation. They are productive. It is in this sense that they are procedural.
