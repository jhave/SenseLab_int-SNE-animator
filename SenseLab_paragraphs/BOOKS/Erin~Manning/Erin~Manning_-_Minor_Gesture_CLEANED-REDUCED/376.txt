Subjectivity is a carrying into existence of feeling-forms self-defining. Subjectivities happen. But they are not where experience begins and ends. They exist in the event of their coming-to-be. There is persistence of subjectivities, but not as fully formed entities. Subjectivities persist in germ. This persistence is what we call history. History, from a process philosophy perspective, is the serial activating of a certain degree of continuity. The mistake would be to see this continuity as pure becoming. It is not a continuity of becoming, as Whitehead might say, but a becoming of continuity. Persistence is never persistence of the same, but persistence of a cut that activates the conditions for a seriality in the making.
