Australian-based Malaysian artist Simryn Gill’s work Pearls (1999–) is a strong example of how the minor gesture can operate in contemporary art. This work is based on the gift. The gift, in Pearls, involves much more than a simple exchange: Gill asks us for a book that we are moved to give her. While it seems clear that the book should hold meaning for us, Gill does not make this a spoken demand. She simply invites a friend, an acquaintance, a fellow artist, to give her a book. This book is then carefully and meticulously torn and pasted to create a string of pearls, which the original owner of the book receives as a gift. Gill keeps the spine. The exchange may seem simple—an object into an object, an object for an object. But try to give away a book, to be ripped, that has followed you, stayed with you, that includes margin notes, that has made you think in ways you couldn’t otherwise have thought, that you’ve returned to either in fact or in spirit over the years, that has become a true friend. This is not an easy task. For three years I’ve wondered about giving up my first copy of Le petit prince with my childhood drawings in the margins, and I still haven’t been able to let go of it. Gill knows that the exchange is complex. She is aware that what is moving across is not simply a book for a necklace. What is moving is at once book and the force of memory as it is awakened and created anew in the act of considering the giving-over. The object will not return. What will return will be variation itself.
