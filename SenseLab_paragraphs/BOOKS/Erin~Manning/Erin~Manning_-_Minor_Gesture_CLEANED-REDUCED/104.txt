What mobilizes the rigor of a speculative pragmatism therefore cannot be a method imposed on the process from without. The rigor must emerge from within the occasion of experience, from the event’s own stakes in its coming-to-be. Technique is necessary. In philosophy, one technique is close reading. This proposition of Bertrand Russell’s is key: “In studying a philosopher, the right attitude is neither reverence nor contempt, but first a kind of hypothetical sympathy, until it is possible to know what it feels like to believe in his theories, and only then a revival of the critical attitude, which should resemble, as far as possible, the state of mind of a person abandoning opinions which he has hitherto held” (1996: 47).
