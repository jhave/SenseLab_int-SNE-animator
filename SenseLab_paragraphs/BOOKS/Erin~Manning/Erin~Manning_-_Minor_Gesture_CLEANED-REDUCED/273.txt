This is not to underestimate the importance of what came before. As Whitehead would say, nonsensuous perception, the way pastness folds into presentness to tweak the in-act, makes a difference in the coming-to-be of what experience can do. The key is to understand that nonsensuous perception is not analogous to the carrying-over of a history fully formed. Nonsensuous perception is an inheritance of the past in the present, an inheritance always in the midst of reinvention, of recomposition. The past is in this way always a futurity in the making. In Kawakuboâ€™s case, one of the areas of inheritance, I believe, is a specific cultural encounter with two singular forms of spatial patterning: the kimono and the tatami. These two patternings have orientations in common: both tend toward a complexity of potential form-takings; both are minimal in their cut, preferring the simplicity of a straight edge that refuses to mold to a predefined shape; and, as a result, both are open to various interpretations of what a fashioning (of the environment, of the body) can do.
