This makes it susceptible to what Nietzsche calls ressentiment—the deep resentment of the world as it is and the tireless wish for the what was. Of course negation would deny any commitment to the what was. Negation is anything but nostalgic. And yet its logic is deeply aligned with that of Nietzsche’s last men, who decry the future, wishing that the what is were not. In a negative alignment to the futurity in the present, the last men work to keep the what was alive, turning their back on change, on difference. While negative critique’s skepticism of the what is and by extension the what was is rooted in a different set of values, what makes negative critique an ally of the last men is the disavowal of the cut of affirmation and its potential to shift the course of time. For both the last men and the critic, time’s differential is the enemy. This makes the last men the best allies of negative critique. Listen as the last men sit around the table and you will hear the voice of the critic among them, decrying the world as it is. The critic is most comfortable where ressentiment dwells.
