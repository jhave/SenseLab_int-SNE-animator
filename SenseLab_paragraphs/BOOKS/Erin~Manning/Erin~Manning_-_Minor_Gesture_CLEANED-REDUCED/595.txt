This planning does not work from the perspective of the ressentiment-clad it could be. It could be is too passive. Study affirms, and in the affirmation it asks not what could we do, but how do we do, how else do we do. Planning in the undercommons is the setting into place of techniques that open the event to its more-than, the setting into place of conditions through which the minor gesture expresses itself, tuning the event to its potential. The planning in the undercommons, the planning in the eventâ€”this is affirmation. This is not policy-making. This planning is the creating of techniques for worlds to come. It is planning as affirmation, planning that does not set apart the field of action from the welling event, planning that does not rely on either/or but moves instead at the speed of the eternal return.
