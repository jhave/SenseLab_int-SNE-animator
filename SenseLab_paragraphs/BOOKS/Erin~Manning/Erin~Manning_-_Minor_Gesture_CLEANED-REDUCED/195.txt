In formalized ritual, the ritual object usually has a role to play both within and beyond the ritual. The ritual object is like a time machine: in its ritual activation it energizes experience such that time is felt differently; in its more passive state, when it crosses the threshold back from the formal ritual into the everyday, it carries the traces of this activation in germ, continuing to affect event-time. From the site of the collective ritual gathering to the site where the object is cared for, usually by an elder in the community, there is here a double sense of the collectiveâ€™s commitment not simply to the object as such, but to what the object can do. This capacity to cross the threshold in two directions emphasizes how collectivity is never only active in its present iteration. Collectivity becomes an expression of how time folds.
