Sad affects are not the result of a sad situation any more than joy in Spinoza is about happiness. Sad affects are created when an accounting takes place after the fact that negates bare activity, the agitation of all that comes to be.3 Soon nostalgia will follow (even if it is negated). For the settling of accounts will never really order experience as it is becoming: only experience as it was can be encapsulated (and then only fleetingly, for it too, is replete with bare activity). The backgrounding of the in-act in the name of an ordering of experience produces sad affects because this cannot but create a deadening, in the event, of what might come to be.
