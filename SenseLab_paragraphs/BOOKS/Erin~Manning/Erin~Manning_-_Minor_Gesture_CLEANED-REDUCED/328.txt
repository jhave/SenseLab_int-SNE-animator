Attending to the more-than is a way of saying that the field itself is attentive to its potential shifts, that the field has within its potential the capacity to create the conditions for difference. The more-than is everywhere present in different constellations—in and across the human, the animal, the vegetal, the mineral. In this emergent speciating field of experience, I propose to explore the workings, nonintentional and yet free, as Bergson would say, of nonvolitional movement. Urgent questions frame the analysis: How can we articulate in language the agencements at the heart of the event’s dance of attention in a way that doesn’t simply take us back to the neurotypical account of experience and its alignment to subject-centered agency? Can we imagine not being the masters of our acts without falling prey to the idea that if we are not master, someone or something else must be? Is it possible to create an account of immanent movement and autistic perception that convinces us that there are other ways to be free?
