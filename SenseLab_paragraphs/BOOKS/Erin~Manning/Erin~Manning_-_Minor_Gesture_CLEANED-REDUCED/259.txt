Certainly a quota of the unimaginable does grace the seasonal fashion runways. But this is the crux: the unimaginable is only to be paraded, not really to be worn—note that the bustle has not yet come back into fashion despite Yamamoto’s and Kawakubo’s best efforts! This is not to deny that each season does bring something new and that we as consumers tend to welcome seasonal shifts in fashion. Sure, we say: Lengthen and accentuate the leg with low-waisted skinny jeans! Or, Let's put everyone in maternity clothes for a summer! And then, the next year: Widen the pant to accentuate the waist! Despite the normative directions of fashion’s operations—retain the proportion between waist, breast, and hip!—mutability does have its place.
