If the feeling of effort is tied to consciousness, it follows that it must be tied to volition. The argument would look like this: when a movement is made consciously, we know the effort contained because movement is volitional, and as such, it belongs to us. A volitional movement, because it is intentional, and because it comes from us, must therefore already include within its parameters the knowledge of how much effort is necessary to carry it out. This effort is learned and comes through repetition. Once the movement becomes a habit it is practiced volitionally, that is, intentionally. We thus have agency over it.
