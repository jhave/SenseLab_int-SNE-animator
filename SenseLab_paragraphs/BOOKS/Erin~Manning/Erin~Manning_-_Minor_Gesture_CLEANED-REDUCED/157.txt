Limits of existence are always under revision. The art of participation takes the notion of modes of existence as its starting point, asking how the conditions that orient it toward its more-than modify or modulate how art can make a difference, opening up the existing fields of relation toward new forms of perception, accountability, experience, and collectivity. This aspect of the art of participation cannot be thought separately from the political, even though the workâ€™s political force is not necessarily in its content. This is not about making the form of art political. It is about asking how the field of relation activated by art can affect the complex ecologies of which it is part.
