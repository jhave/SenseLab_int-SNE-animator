Weather Patterns began with a textile collection entitled Volumetrics. Conceived in relation to my other textile collection, Folds to Infinity, Volumetrics is a series of sixty large rectangular black pieces of fabric, each of which has rare earth magnets sewn into its surface. These magnets, as in the Folds to Infinity collection, encourage connection across pieces as well as enabling intuitive practices of folding (a folding that occurs despite the participant as the magnets connect to each other across a single piece of fabric or between two or more pieces). In addition to the magnets, elastic cord is woven through buttonholes with toggles to stop the cord. With the magnets, this allows for the creation of complex shapes. Snaps and zippers are also sewn into several of the pieces, as well as a few buttons. All of these connective propositions work together as an invitation for a hands-on participation that can lead to the creation of both garments and, in the bestcase scenario, mobile architectures.
