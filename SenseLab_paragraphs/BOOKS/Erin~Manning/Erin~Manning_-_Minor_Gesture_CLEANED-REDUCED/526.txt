AB: Would this not mean that bodies are “worldwide entities”? Singularities of a manifold, worldwide field, shared not only with other human bodies, but with innumerous nonhuman bodies as well? Like our liaisons with the sun, for instance? An intimate relationship between our human body and a nonhuman body? Or the special liaison of plants with the sun?
EM: William James said that the relations are as real as the terms of the relation. That is how he defines radical empiricism. So yes, the relationscape of the bodying is worldwide, even otherworldly, in the sense that it invents worlds. A body is a field of relation out of which and through which worldings occur and evolve. We know neither where a world begins nor where a body ends. What is real, what we know, are relations. This is speculative pragmatism: relations are real, here and now, but what they can do is unknowable in advance, must continuously be invented.
