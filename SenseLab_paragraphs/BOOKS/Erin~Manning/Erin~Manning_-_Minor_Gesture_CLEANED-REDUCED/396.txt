Let’s say that in both cases we are in the same kitchen. The tending toward apple for the neurotypical is likely facilitated first by a sense of hunger. In this situation, hunger may seem solely located in the body, but it is actually an effect of the field. Think, for instance, of how often hunger strikes at the idea of food, even without a prior conscious sense of being hungry. In these cases the food acts as an agencement to hunger, activating the experience of “a body feeling hungry.” This is equally the case when the food isn’t actually there. When this happens the subjective aim is tuned to a virtual object. In either case, actually or virtually, pulled by the sense of hunger, you find yourself reaching. The apple becomes the facilitator for a gesture that does not strictly belong to you. This gesture is in an ecology of hunger, apple, body, movement. The apple activates it in co-occurrence with the feeling of hunger, and the reaching responds. What is emerging is an event of hunger appeasement.
