Within the complexity of movement-moving, there is movement not yet actualized for experience—Jose Gil calls this total movement—and there is actual movement.8 Similar to Bergson’s theory of duration, where time actualized in experience is always co-composing with the durational field from which it has emerged, a field that is virtual but real, movement actualized does not neutrally detach itself from total movement. Like duration, total movement is a field of relation that is always actively co-composing with the actual in its emergence: the virtual, felt in its effects, is always active in the actual—this is what makes it real. When this or that experience differentiates itself from the field, when it becomes this or that, it has therefore altered the wider field of experience. The field, as I argued in the introduction, has changed in nature.
What occurs to activate the pulling of a movement in a new direction if human intentionality or agency is not the core activator? What I want to suggest here is that every experience of movement felt is the result of a point of inflection in experience, an inflection activated not simply by the individual but by the tending of the field itself.
