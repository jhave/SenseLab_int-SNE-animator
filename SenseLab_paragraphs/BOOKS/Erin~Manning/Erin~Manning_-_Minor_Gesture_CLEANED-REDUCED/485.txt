“Anecdotal reports suggest that individuals with autism have trouble gauging how much time has passed, and parsing the order of events.”5= Speaking of her autistic son with adhd (and wondering where the two conditions meet), Emily Willingham similarly emphasizes a strange sense of time: “One area of overlap is their sense (or lack thereof) of time and timing. They both show delays in responding to spoken questions or requests. When their peers learned to tell time in elementary school, they were completely at sea, unable to instinctively comprehend the passage of time. Even now, in their adolescence, the question ‘What day is it?’ is frequent, as is ‘What are we having for lunch?’ within an hour of having had lunch.”
