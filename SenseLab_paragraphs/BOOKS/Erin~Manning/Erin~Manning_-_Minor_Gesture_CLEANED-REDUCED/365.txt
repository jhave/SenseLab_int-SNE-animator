In autistic Lucy Blackman’s writing, carrying attaches itself to nouns. “When I refer to something within myself,” she writes, I often use the word “carrying” as an adjective just before the word for the emotion or whatever. So when I draft what I want to say, the word “carrying” frequently appears but I usually edit it out so it doesn’t confuse or distract other people. . . . What do I mean by “carrying my world”? I think that most people see themselves as moving between the things and the space on each side of them, so that the area in front comes up and parts before their faces, because that is how the television camera shows “reality.” Somehow I use space differently. My space envelopes me as if I were in a cocoon, and the items and other aspects of my environment enter and leave that cocoon. (2013: 6)
