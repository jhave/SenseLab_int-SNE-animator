I hope that both the philosophy and the art I do are useless in this sense. As more and more of us actively—activistly—reframe the useless in a speculatively pragmatic sense, perhaps we can redefine value outside of a capitalist mandate. In so doing, perhaps we’ll even be able to come back to the original idea of philosophy, which, as you know, had nothing to do with a discipline. Philosophy was what you did in relation to other practices, it was what emerged from practices that remained other, such as art, mathematics, physics. It was never meant to be a field that needed to separate itself out. What if we took philosophy and art not as disciplines but as forms of thinking in the making, and making in the thinking? What if the thinking-doing were conceived as a value in itself, independent of what form it takes?
