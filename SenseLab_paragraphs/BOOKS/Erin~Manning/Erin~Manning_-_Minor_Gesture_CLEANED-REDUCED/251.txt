Modes of existence come into being through enabling constraints. They emerge out of a necessity that has a procedural tending. This necessity is enabling in the sense that it provokes new forms of process, but constrained in the sense that it occurs according to the limits of this or that singular junction. Each time a mode of existence comes into being, it does so “just this way,” in direct accordance with how the constraint was enabling in this singular set of conditions.
