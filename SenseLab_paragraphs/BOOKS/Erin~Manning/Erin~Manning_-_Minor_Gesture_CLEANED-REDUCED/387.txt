The world of pure experience is for all of us a shape-shifting as-yetunparsed ecology, but for autistics, because they dwell in autistic perception more than neurotypicals do, the ungainliness of its potential is foregrounded in ways that make more apparent the necessity for agencement. Agencement, like its sister concept the minor gesture, comes from the field, from the region of experience toward which and through which the event is unfolding. In neurotypical experience, this process of the shift from the as-yet-unparsed to perception is so backgrounded that the agencement necessary to bring things into focus seems to occur volitionally, in the subject, in the individual body. As I have argued throughout, this is a mirage supported by the identity politics of neurotypical able-bodiedness, fed to most of us from earliest childhood by our cultural surrounds and bolstered by our education. Because this viewpoint is so pervasive, autistics are made to feel as though their way of functioning is completely off.
If instead of succumbing to the neurotypical account as ground of experience we begin with autistic perception, the focus changes. We move from the idea that the act must be directly allied to an individual’s volition toward an account of agencement. Donna Williams explains: “Because things that were meant to be tuned out weren’t, these things were all competing for processing when they shouldn’t have been. I was jumping between processing the white of the page as well as the print, the flicker of light and shadow as well as the objects themselves, the sounds of the people moving about in between syllables of words being said at the same time, the rustle of clothing and the sound of my own voice” (1996: 92). The competition for processing, as Williams calls it, foregrounds the workings of agencement emphasizing the nonvolitional share of event-directionality. Event-directionality makes stabilizing difficult, however.
