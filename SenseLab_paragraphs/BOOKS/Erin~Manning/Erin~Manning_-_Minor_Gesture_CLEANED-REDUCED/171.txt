A fielding of difference has been activated, and this must be tended. The art of participation involves creating the conditions for this tending to take place. This tending is first and foremost a tending of the fragile environment of duration generated by the working of the work and activated by the minor gesture. A tending of the work’s incipient rhythms. I say fragile because there is so much to be felt in the process of a work’s coming to resonance with a world itself in formation.
Sympathy makes felt how the tendency, the way, the direction or incipient mobility, is itself the subject of the work. Sympathy makes tending the subject, undermining the notion that either the work or the human come to experience fully formed. Sympathy: that which brings the force of the more-than to the surface. That which makes felt how the force of experience always exceeds the object. That which generates the opening for the minor gesture to take the work on its way.
