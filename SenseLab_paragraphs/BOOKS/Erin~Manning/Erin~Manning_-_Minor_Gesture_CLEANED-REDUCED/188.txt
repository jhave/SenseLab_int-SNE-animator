A weather pattern is an artful expression of experienceâ€™s lively differential. Perhaps the mention of the smell of red moves you to a September afternoon in the northern autumn. Perhaps this connection is spurred by the memory of leaves turning red along the street where you lived, or by the memory of jumping in piles of those crisp leaves and feeling them carry your weight, or by recalling the feeling of a cool afternoon spent bagging leaves that left their scent on your hands. The smell of red is all of these things but none of them alone. The smell of red: a direct feeling of redness that folds into itself a living memory of a certain quality of air, of a certain angle of light, of a certain sense of place. The smell of red is less a recollection of something specific than a sense of accompaniment, a living-again of the activity of a series coming together just this way. The smell of red is how the weather pattern of autumn makes itself felt.
