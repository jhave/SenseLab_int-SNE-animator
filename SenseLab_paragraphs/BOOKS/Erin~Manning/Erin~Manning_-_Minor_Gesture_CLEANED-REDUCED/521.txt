Bifo writes: “We have today a new cultural task: to live the inevitable with a relaxed soul. To call forth a big wave of withdrawal, of massive dissociation, of desertion from the scene of the economy, of nonparticipation in the fake show of politics” (Berardi 2011: 148). Wouldn’t such a task be the very recipe for the kind of depression Bifo forecasts? To act must not be overlaid with capitalism’s call to do, to make. In the act is something different altogether: precarious, but creative. Not creative of capitalism’s “newest new,” but creative of new forms of value, new ways of valuing modes of existence in their emergence and dissolution, new alignments to the time of the event. The challenge: to maintain the schism between the in-act and the act. Systems are quickly formed, as are our habits of existence. And if these systems, these habits, reorient toward the individual in the mode of the preconstituted subject, we can be sure that there will be a deadening of the operations of the movement for neurodiversity. But this isn’t where I think we’re headed. I prefer to listen to the autistics named above, most of them young adults. For they reassure me: the in-act is where the joy is, where the minor gestures tune experience to its more-than, where activity is not yet dedicated to a cause, or to an effect, but open for the desiring.
