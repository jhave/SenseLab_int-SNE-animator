Minor gestures trouble institutional frameworks in the same way they trouble existing forms of value. This is their potential: they open the artistic process beyond the matter-form of its object, beyond the prestige value that comes with all of the artistic conclusions that surround us.5 The minor gesture is the felt experience of potential, the force that makes felt how a process is never about an externally situated individual, but about the ecology it calls forth.
