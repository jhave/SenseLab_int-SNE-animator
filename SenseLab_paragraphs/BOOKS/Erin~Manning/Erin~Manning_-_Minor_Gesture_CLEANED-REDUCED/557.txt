Ressentiment is particularly invested in framing memory: memory is what holds the what was in place. The ills, the mistreatments, the judgments and abuses, these become an echo chamber that resonates in the taut alignment between past and present, the worldview always over the shoulder. In the context of the debt owed to African Americans, Fred Moten writes: “There’s a very important, and let’s call it righteous strain, of Afro-American and Afro-Diasporic studies that we could place under the rubric of debt collection. And it’s basically like, ‘we did this and we did that, and you continue not to acknowledge it. You continue to mis-name it. You continue to violently misunderstand it. And I’m going to correct the record and collect this debt.’ And there’s a political component to it, too. Maybe that’s partly what the logic of reparations is about” (Moten and Harney 2013: 151). To remember becomes a daily practice. The horror of oppression soon occupies the whole of remembrance. The weight of debt choreographs this circuit. The debt is real, as is the memory. The resentment is justified. A repayment would make a difference. But would it take us out of the cycle?
