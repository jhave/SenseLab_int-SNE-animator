A memory of the future is the direct experience of time’s differential. “It is a question here of something which has been present, that has been felt, but that has not been acted” (Lapoujade 2010: 21–22). A memory not only of and for the human: a memory active in duration itself, a memory inseparable from duration’s relational movement. Not only of and for the human because duration is not strictly speaking of the human—“duration does not attach itself to being—or to beings, it coincides with pure becoming” (Lapoujade 2010: 24).
