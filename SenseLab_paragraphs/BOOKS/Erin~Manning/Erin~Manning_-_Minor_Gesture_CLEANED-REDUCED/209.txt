The rituals with their ceremonies, their festivals . . . [keep] producing the amalgamation of these two elements of memory over and over again. They [trigger] recollection at certain times and [remain] handles of memory for a lifetime. In this way, voluntary and unvoluntary recollection lose their mutual exclusiveness” (1973: 113).
Simryn Gill works with the ethos of care this passage of the aura entails, careful and caring in the act of taking care of the book’s variation in transformation. The minor gesture here is the activation of a relational field that includes the book and the beads but also exceeds both of them, opening them up to the vectorization of their incipient tendencies, tendencies that now include, with the memories of the past in the present, the words and pages coming-into-variation as beads and the felt weight of that labor in the form of the necklace.
