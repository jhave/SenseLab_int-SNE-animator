Facilitated communication (fc), the organization of a support system around communication used by many classical autistics who cannot communicate with their voice, usually begins with hand support but often persists long after hand support is no longer needed. Normative accounts of individual volition suggest that facilitation must mean a lack of authenticity as regards communication.9 Indeed, a whole backlash exists which argues that the facilitators are actually doing the writing for the autistics. To be considered properly intelligent, autistics must therefore submit to endless tests that control for individual expression: they must show that their words are really their own. When asked about the importance of independence for communication in an interview, Blackman responds: “That is crazy! Communication is interdependent. It is like asking someone to waltz or foxtrot without a partner” (2013: 113).
