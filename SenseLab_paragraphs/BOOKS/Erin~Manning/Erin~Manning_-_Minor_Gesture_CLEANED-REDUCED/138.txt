Intuition never stems from what is already conceived. Wary of false problems, it introduces into experience a rift in knowing, a schism in perception. It forces experience to the limits not only of what it can imagine, but what it has technically achieved. For intuition is never separate from technique. It is a rigorous process that consists in pushing technique to its limit, revealing its technicity. Technicity: the outdoing of technique that makes the more-than of experience felt.
