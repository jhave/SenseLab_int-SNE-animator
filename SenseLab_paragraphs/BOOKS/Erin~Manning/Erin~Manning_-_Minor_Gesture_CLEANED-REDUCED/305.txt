Like many classical autistics, Ido Kedar came to language late. Coordinating his fingers to be able to type was a long process, and because his body often went against his wishes, moving in directions contrary to those he thought of as aligned to his conscious intentions, it was incredibly difficult for him to demonstrate to his aides that he was indeed capable of understanding their directives. This condition, which affects all classical autistics to differing degrees, is defined most aptly in the current literature as “autistic movement disturbance.” Following older neuroscientific literature, Kedar calls it “motor apraxia.” Through his writing in Ido in Autismland: Climbing Out of Autism’s Silent Prison, Kedar hopes to educate neurotypical readers and parents of autistics about movement disturbances in autism. His outspoken desire is that parents and specialists no longer rely on the outward appearance of autistic movement to determine what autistics can do. Just because autistics have challenges with movement and communication, Kedar argues, does not mean that they cannot understand what is going on around them. Referring to the period before Kedar could express himself in writing, Kedar’s mother explains: “Ido was bored out of his mind, trapped in a paralyzing silence and frustrated beyond belief. He tried hard to show that he was smart but his hands and his body did not cooperate with his mind, so everyone assumed that he just didn’t understand the concepts. I cannot imagine a greater exercise in frustration.” “The experts,” Kedar says, “have no clue” (2012: 24).
