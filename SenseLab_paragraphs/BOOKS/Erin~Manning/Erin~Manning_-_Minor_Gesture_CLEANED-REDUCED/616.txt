Planning and fabulation are inextricably linked. In a pull to a futurity active in a time too cyclic to narrate vertically across linear time, fabulation energizes the past, retelling pastness at those junctures that connect it to the ineffable not-yet. It speaks in the between of what is usually considered important and retells stories from perspectives that make felt the complexity of the ecologies operative in the inheritances that carry us forward. It recognizes that something else is at stake here, another kind of power. Planning takes this power, this power of the false, and moves it in a direction as yet unqualified. What is planned in the undercommons of fabulation are the conditions for an action as yet unmappable. For inheritance as lived from the perspective of the undercommons brings past and future into a mobile coexistence. No history only knows itself from one perspective, and no history writes itself without fabulation. Fabulation activates, in the historical record yet to be mobilized, again, the force of deviation within the strands of how experience accounts for itself.
