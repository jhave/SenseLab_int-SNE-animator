Idle No More did not come out of nowhere. And yet it did. This is the strange thing about affirmationâ€”that it is always wholly new, and always already present, for all time.11 This untimeliness reveals another kind of history than that penned for reconciliation, a history fabulated in the retelling, invented in the interstices of what cannot yet be spoken, played at the junctures where rules are invented in the event of the game. This we learn from our children whose games morph in the playing, and for whom the art of fabulating is still very much alive. In the midst of the play, in the game whose rules would keep changing on the fly, Idle No More at once revealed itself and was born, inventing its history with the words of the future, receptive, from the moment of its inception, to the cycle of eternal return already so much a part of First Nations culture.
