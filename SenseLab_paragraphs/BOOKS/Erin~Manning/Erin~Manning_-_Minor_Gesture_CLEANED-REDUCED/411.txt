In my attempt to think beyond the neurotypical aligning of volition, intentionality, and agency, I am of course not suggesting that no will is present in movement. Volition always has a role to play in the way expression arises. A shift away from the triad simply suggests that volition is not where we usually assume it is: it is not ahead of experience, but in experience, in the between of the conscious and the nonconscious, actively composing in the ecology of practices. This has ethical consequences. What is at stake in the pervasive account of aligning subject-based volition to experience? What happens to our unwavering belief in neurotypicality as the measure of human existence when its central tenets are put into question? Similarly, what happens to the narrative of neurodiversity when we stop speaking of the involuntary—or, better said, the nonvoluntary—as though it were other to “better” ways of moving, of thinking, of speaking?
