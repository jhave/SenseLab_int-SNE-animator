Propitious conditions facilitate contemplation. Contemplation, understood as the act of lingering-with, of tending to a process, is a minor form of doing. It attends to the conditions of the workâ€™s work. Contemplation is passive only in the sense that this attending provokes a waiting, a stilling, a listening, a sympathy-with. This sympathy is enveloped in the process, sympathetic to the ineffable share of experience emboldened by the minor gesture, attuned to the fragile art of time. Contemplation, operative at the
edges of perception where the conscious and the nonconscious overlap, activates times of its own making, sometimes even opening the neurotypical to autistic perception. For contemplation, like intuition and its counterpart, sympathy, activates the differential of an event and, in so doing, becomes responsive to the subtle nuances of experience crafting itself.
