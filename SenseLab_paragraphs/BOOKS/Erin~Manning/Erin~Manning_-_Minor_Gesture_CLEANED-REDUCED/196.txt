Through this crossing of the threshold, the ritual object is the force that holds a community together, both past and future. The ritual object, both actively and passively, performs a passage that activates that collectivity, making felt time’s spiral: despite their adherence to the inheritance of the past, rituals are ever-changing, altered by the conditions of futurities in the making. It is these futurities in the making, as mobilized by the force of form of the object, that continue to be felt in the object’s passage back to the everyday. This is the case even when that passage is virtual, where objects are destroyed in the ritual. This potential, this force of form, is what is cared for by the community between rituals. This explains why the object is considered sacred even when in retreat. This is not usually the case with objects activated in the gallery, particularly those objects that are seen as discardable in advance—elastic bands, plastic cups, candies. The object in this context is only asked to cross the threshold in one direction. If the use of the multiple is in some sense invested in rituality, might there be something to be said for asking how the object can perform its return to the everyday? Can the object carry its more-than beyond the gallery setting? Could the object return to the pantry, to the cupboard, to the closet, to be used again, differently, instead of either going into storage or being discarded?
