This new justice counters ressentiment. Here, where the time of the event is not measured in advance, we are alive in a sociality as yet unscripted, a black sociality, as Moten might say. Yes, we are owed, yes, we owe, but we have somewhere else to go, somewhere else to be. The feeling of power, the force of will, moves the event, and with it, we are moved. Being moved does not mean being happy. In affirmation, we are not in the midst of a simple acquiescence. Affirmation is not about following along. A culture of affirmation socially, collectively, makes its own path, and it does not bray: its noises are not so easily parsed as positive or negative, not so easily positioned or understood. In a culture of affirmation there are screams, there are squeaks and moans. There is the unmitigated noise of ecologies under destruction, the silence of the missing bees, the pounding heat of too many untreed sidewalks. There is also love, and laughter.
