Donna Williams writes: I was deeply mesmerized with all things aesthetic and sensory from at least 6 months of age. Being meaning deaf, I saw musically. Being face blind, I was attuned to movement patterns. Being object blind and context blind, I’d tap everything to make noise, to hear its “voice,” flick it to feel its movement, turn it to experience how it caught light, toss and drop and shred and snap and sprinkle grass, sand, twigs, leaves. I’d lick and run my hands and face over surfaces, wrap myself into fabrics. I’d align myself with symmetry and lines, mold myself into forms to feel their shape as them, stare at colors and lights and shapes trying to become one with them.27
Facilitation aligns. Recall the proposition from chapter 5 that movement is made possible by the interrelation between the intervals of movementmoving and the collective capacity to align to them, in the event. Note that what facilitates the coming-to-perception in Williams’s account above is exactly the same kind of aligning to the interval, an aligning that involves the placing-into-relation not of the objects, but of what they can do, how they sound, how they feel, what they taste like.
