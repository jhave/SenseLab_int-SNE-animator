Consider the work of Beijing-based artist Song Dong entitled Waste Not
(2005–). This work is described in the following way: Waste Not [is] comprised of over 10,000 items ranging from pots and basins to blankets, bottle caps, toothpaste tubes, and stuffed animals collected by the artist’s mother over the course of more than five decades. . . . Waste Not follows the Chinese concept of wu jin qi yong or “waste not,” as a prerequisite for survival. The project evolved out of a family necessity and the artist’s mother’s grief after the death of her husband. . . . The centerpiece of the installation is the architectural armature of the building where the artist was born. A core theme of Waste Not is the idea that people, everyday objects and personal stories are not only spiritually rich in thematic material but recognizable evidence of the impact of politics and history on family life.
