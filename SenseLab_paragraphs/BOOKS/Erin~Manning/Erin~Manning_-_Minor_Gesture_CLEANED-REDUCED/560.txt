A culture of affirmation does not deny that there is an infinite debt to be repaid. The difference is that the response to the debt, to the indebtedness, isn’t reactive. What keeps it from falling into ressentiment is that it refuses to dwell in the unfulfillable wish. Instead, it moves elsewhere, asking, as Moten and Harney do, what else? What else can we do in the face of this unpayable debt? What else can we do in this culture of credit which breeds ressentiment? How else can the suffering be mitigated? Because let’s be clear: repayment can never undo deep and life-changing suffering. It can only recognize it. And while this recognition is definitely something, is it enough? I don’t believe it is. It keeps us within the same tight circle. It holds us to the crafting of experience as oriented by the perpetrator: the repayment of the debt is, after all, always done in the name of the sovereign who now holds the power to repay or bestow apology. To believe that payment is possible, to believe that payment will do the job, that payment will still the anguish and change the stakes, that recognition of our pain by the dominant class will fundamentally alter our conditions, is still, no matter how important, to return us to the dialectic.
