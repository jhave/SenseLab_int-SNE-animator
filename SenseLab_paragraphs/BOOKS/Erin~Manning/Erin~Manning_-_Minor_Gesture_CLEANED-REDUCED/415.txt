James continues: So much for the essentials of the cognitive relation, where the knowledge is conceptual in type, or forms knowledge “about” an object. It consists in intermediary experiences (possible, if not actual) of continuously developing progress, and, finally, of fulfillment, when the sensible percept, which is the object, is reached. The percept here not only verifies the concept, proves its function of knowing that percept to be true, but the percept’s existence as the terminus of the chain of intermediaries creates the function. Whatever terminates that chain was, because it now proves itself to be, what the concept “had in mind.” (1996: 60–61)
