The individual, emergent from the process, cannot be fully abstracted from the force of the preindividual, the virtual excess or more-than that accompanies all processes of force taking form. If the more-than of a process’s individuality accompanies all comings-to-form, this means that there is no phase of a process that isn’t actively in excess of the form it takes. A process is thus by its very nature collective. It is an ecology of practices. Whereas in many readings of collectivity, the multiple refers to the sum of individual parts (thereby subsuming the collective to the individuals within it), for Simondon individuation is always transindividual. Individuals do emerge from it, but the process can never be returned to the sum of its parts. Even the individual, when abstracted, cannot simply be reduced to a sum, for it continues to carry its preindividual charge, a charge that “contains potentials and virtuality,” which means it is susceptible to continuous changes in kind (Simondon 2005: 248; my translation).
Simondon uses the concept of the transindividual to describe the collectivity at the heart of all individuations, before and beyond any speciating into individuals. He mobilizes the transindividual to make apparent that any shift in the event is a shift in the ecology of which it is composed. The transindividual is the concept that most underscores the fact that all events are collaborative, participatory.
