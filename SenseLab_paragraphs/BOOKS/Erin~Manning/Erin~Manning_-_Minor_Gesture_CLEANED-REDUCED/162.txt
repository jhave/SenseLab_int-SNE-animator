If the art of time is inextricably linked to practice as way, then practice and intuition must always be seen as co-operative: intuition is the fold in experience that allows for the staging of a problem that starts a process on its way, or curbs a process into its difference, creating the germ for a practice. This raises the question of where intuition is situated is relation to practice’s inherent double: participation. Is participation also intuitive? I would say that where art as event is mobilized through an intuitive process that crafts and vectorizes the problem that will continue to activate it throughout its life, participation is the sympathy for this process. Participation is the yield in what Ruyer calls the “aesthetic yield.” It is the yield both in the sense that it gives direction to a process already under way and that it opens that process to the more-than of its form or content.
