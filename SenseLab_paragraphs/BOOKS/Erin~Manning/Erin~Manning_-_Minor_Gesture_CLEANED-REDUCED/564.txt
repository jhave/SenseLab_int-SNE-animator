Nietzsche talked of the will to power as the feeling of power. “Will” may just be the wrong word: too quickly aligned to volition, too quickly connected to the subject. Certainly here, in a book skeptical about the place of volition within subject formation (and agency), “will” would seem an odd word to use. Deleuze writes: “For Nietzsche, the capacity for being affected is not necessarily a passivity but an affectivity, a sensibility, a sensation. It is in this sense that Nietzsche, even before elaborating the concept of the will to power and giving it its full significance, was already speaking of a feeling of power. Before treating power as a matter of will he treated it as a matter of feeling and sensibility” (2002: 62).
