To hear the differential of music’s immanent rhythms, to participate directly in the quality of its sounding, it is necessary to hold back the conscious ordering of sensation. It is necessary to increase the duration of the experience of direct perception, thereby honing autistic perception. For Bergson, this means doing away with the idea that sensation can be measured, which also means: articulated, identified, parsed. Parsing, so allied with the neurotypical, not only reduces our capacity to feel the complexity of the event in the event, it perpetuates the hierarchy of conscious experience over nonconscious experience, reason over affect. “What strengthens the illusion on this point is that we have become accustomed to believe in the immediate perception of a homogeneous movement in a homogeneous space” (2007: 49). By situating the event outside of its activity, we become accustomed to neutralizing the force not only of what the event can do, but what the event is doing. In Bergson’s account, this involves a post facto spatialization of duration, of event-time.
