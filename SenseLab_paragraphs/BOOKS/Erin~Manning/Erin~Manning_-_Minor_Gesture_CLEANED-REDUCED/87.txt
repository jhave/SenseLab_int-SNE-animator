Whitehead begins by defining the function of reason in opposition to “the godlike faculty which surveys, judges and understands,” as “the art of life” (1929: 4). The Kantian definition of reason, which has left its imprint on contemporary understandings of reason, is here cast aside for a strange and compelling account of reason as the appetite for the cut of difference.
