In chapter 2, where the concept of the artful takes form, I propose we work not with the current and most typical definition of art, which tends still to foreground an object, but with an aspect of its medieval definition: art as the way. By focusing on process instead of form, it becomes possible not only to raise the issue of the object—to ask how a focus on the object is similar in many ways to situating the subject as initiator of experience—but to explore how time is engaged in the artistic process. Following Bergson, I turn to intuition, and its manner of making time. I argue that intuition is as key to a process as any other building-block and that through intuition, as allied to the creation of a problem, the artful comes to expression.
