“Freedom” may not be a word to hold onto. For now, I use it as a placeholder to remind us that volition and freedom need not be thought of as complementary. I use it also because the neurodiverse are rarely considered free in a world where freedom is usually associated with independence. A serious taking into account of the nonvoluntary aspect of freedom Bergson foregrounds might ultimately make the neurodiverse free, free to be different, free to need and receive facilitation, free to perceive the complexity of experience on their own terms, and free, also, to move, to live, to love in unpredictable ways. For freedom is not to be found in the ordering of experience, in its measure, but in the dynamic intensity of the event’s unfolding. This unfolding affects us, moves us, directs us, but it does not belong to us. Freedom is transversal to the human: it cuts across human experience but is not defined by it. As Bergson writes: “The process of our free activity goes on, as it were, unknown to ourselves, in the obscure depths of our consciousness at every moment of duration” (2007: 237). The heterogeneity of the noncontinuous nature of experience is certainly not easy to articulate, but it is rich, infinitely so. To hear it, it is necessary to refrain from setting experience apart from the in-act.
