What  is  at  stake  is  the  very  redefi	of knowledge. For what research-creation does is ask us to engage directly with a process which, in many cases, will not or cannot be articulated in language. Philosophically, this involves an opening toward a speculative pragmatism that defies existing understandings of where knowledge is situated and what it can do. Innate knowledge—intuition, speculation—is frowned upon within methodological approaches, unless they can somehow be quantified. We need look no further than our own PhD programs in research-creation to see that our emphasis on the written document is about situating incipiency, locating intuition, managing speculation.
Research-creation does not need new methods. What it needs is a reaccounting of what writing can do in the process of thinking-doing. At its best, writing is an act, alive with the rhythms of uncertainty and the openings of a speculative pragmatism that engages with the force of the milieu where transversality is at its most acute. These, however, are not, generally speaking, the documents we require from students of research-creation. What we require, in the name of the academic institution, are documents that facilitate the task of our evaluation of their projects, writing that describes, orients, defends. This is the paradox: we are excited by the openings research-creation provides and yet remain largely unwilling to take them on their own terms and experiment with them as new modes of existence and new forms of knowledge. We remain held by existing methods because we remain incapable (or unwilling) to evaluate knowledge on its own incipient terms, or, better, to engage productively with new concepts of value.
