The artful is the event’s capacity to foreground the feeling-tone of the occasion such that it generates an affective tonality that permeates more than this singular occasion. For this to happen, there has to be, within the evolution of an occasion, the capacity for the occasion to become a nexus that continues to have an appetite for its process. This does not mean to imply that the occasion will not perish. It simply emphasizes that in the perishing, there can be a qualitative shading that persists in occasions to come. As feeling-tone, vectors attune to the field of relation and tune it to its more-than. In so doing, they activate the collectivity of a given nexus of occasions. What emerges, in the act, is what Whitehead would call a society, a becoming of a wider field of relation that outdoes the atomicity of the occasion’s initial coming into being. As Whitehead underscores, this is a rhythmic (and not a linear) process. It swings from the in-itselfness of a given actual occasion, where what is fashioned is simply what it is, to a wider field where the openness to fashioning remains rife with potential not only in the occasion at hand but across the wider expanse of the occasion’s nexus. The artful lives at this intersection.
