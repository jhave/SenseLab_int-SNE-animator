Think the interval not only as the force of form in the context of a simple movement. Think it also in its potential as an opening onto agencement, as opposed to agency.
Agency begins in a category. It is used to place the action of volition in a subject or a group. That said, I recognize that agency is often used in academic discourse to give voice to an underrepresented group. We talk about the agency of the disabled, the agency of the autistic, the agency of women of color. We speak of the need for the disenfranchised to have agency.
