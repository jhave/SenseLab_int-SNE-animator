Every weather pattern includes a minor gesture. The minor gesture is the pulse of a differential that makes experience in its ecology felt. It is the generative force that opens the field of experience to the ways it both comes together and subtly differentiates from itself. In the tuning of the season to fall—which in Canada is also accompanied by a shift in the smell of earth as the grass begins to dry out and the leaves fall on it and are stepped on, with a shift in light from the fullness of an immersive brightness to the becoming-angled light of winter, with a different sense of warmth on skin as the layers of cotton and wool and silk and leather compose with the winter body, with a shift in the feeling of ground as bare feet in sandals give in to the enclosure of boots—sensations, perceptions, feelings are active at the threshold of a shifting experience that cannot be reduced to one aspect of weather alone (the leaves, the sun, the earth). A weather pattern, when it emerges, is the activating of a certain minor tendency that resonates across time. This tendency is a gesture felt in the event both as absolutely singular and infinitely multiplicitous. The one and the many, the minor gesture has a quality of a resonant multiplicity singularly itself.
