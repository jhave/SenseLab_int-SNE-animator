This is the paradox: for there to be a theory of the “object,” the “object” has to be conceived as out of time, relegated beyond experience, unchanging. Yet, in experience, what we call an object is always to some degree not-yet, in process, in movement. In the midst, in the event, we know the object not in its fullness, in its ultimate form, but as an edging into experience. What resolves in experience is not, as Whitehead would argue, first and foremost a chair, but the activity of sitability. It is only after the fact, after the initial entrainment the chair activates, after the movement into the relational field of “sitability,” that the chair as such is ascertained, felt in all its “object-like” intensity. But even here, Whitehead would argue, its threedimensional form cannot be disconnected from the quality of its formtaking. Form is less the endpoint than the conduit.
