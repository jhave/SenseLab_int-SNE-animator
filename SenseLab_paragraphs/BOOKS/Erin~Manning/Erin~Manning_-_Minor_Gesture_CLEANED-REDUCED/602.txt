Beyond interpretation means beyond an analysis that would seek to measure only according to the given. Evaluative judgment is too content with the it is, too sure in advance of what the stakes are. Between an incipient valuation and judgment-oriented evaluation, two kinds of truth are at work. One is a truth that puts its faith in the past and feels accountable to that past. A process of excavation is often necessary to reveal it. This process of excavation, directed as it is toward a unifying event, is perilously close to what creates ressentiment in Nietzsche’s last men, for it is concerned first and foremost with what was. In a gesture similar to that of the nostalgic harking back that breeds a lackluster relationship to the affirmation of life in the making, this excavation of the past relies on the belief that the truth will forever stay the same. The work of the excavator is to build resistant tunnels into the past so that this unwavering truth can easily be reached. Life is attended to in reverse, with the past as the barometer for the present. The second kind of truth, allied to Deleuze’s concept of the power of the false, is serial. Here narration is mutational and the posture is less the crawl down the tunnel than the Nietzschean leap from peak to peak. “Narration is constantly being completely modified . . . not according to subjective variations, but as a consequence of disconnected places and dechronologized moments” (Deleuze 1989: 133). Time serially folding onto itself in an eternal return of difference.
