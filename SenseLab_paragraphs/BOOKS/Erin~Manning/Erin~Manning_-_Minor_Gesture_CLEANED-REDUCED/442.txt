Ralph Savarese, a poet himself and a committed autism advocate, has worked with emergent autistic poets to assist them in honing this craft, which, while it does seem to come all of its own, deserves the same kind of attention we give to neurotypical writing. “I’ve already seen significant development in my son’s fledgling work,” Savarese writes, speaking of DJ Savarese, a young autistic poet who is now the first nonspeaking student in creative writing at Oberlin College, “and together we have vowed to perfect our mutual craft. As [Larry Bissonnette] would say, ‘It’s past point of personal hobby’ or, for that matter, unwitting obsession” (2008: 6). Speaking of poetry as a meeting point between those on the spectrum of neurodiversity, Savarese writes of the necessity of crafting a certain neurocosmopolitanism that might facilitate the carrying of modes of perception across what is too often perceived as an unbridgeable divide. This might in turn create modes of speaking and listening that could weaken neurotypicality as the dominant paradigm of human existence.
