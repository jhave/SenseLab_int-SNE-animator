For Nietzsche, affirmation is never reactive. Reactivity is a secondary gesture. It is an interpretation of the cut. Though it seems to coincide with the cutting, in effect reactivity stands just outside its momentum, peering in from the edges. In the interpreting or judging stance, reactivity mutes the minor gesture. It cements the field, holds it to what it is. Interpretationas-judgment only asks what if from the solid stance of the it is. It does not risk the what else. The categories are clear even when they are being challenged. This is not to suggest that there is no work to do in interpretation. Nor does it suggest that in interpretation all potential is cast aside: interpretation can certainly be affirmative, curious, and creative. It is to say that when interpretation becomes judgment and thus takes the place of affirmation, the event is held in place and its potential tunes toward reactivity. With judgment, the work of thinking, of encountering, is laid out in terms of a field already oriented. Once judgment takes over, it takes a lot to reenergize the field, to move it toward its minor quality.
