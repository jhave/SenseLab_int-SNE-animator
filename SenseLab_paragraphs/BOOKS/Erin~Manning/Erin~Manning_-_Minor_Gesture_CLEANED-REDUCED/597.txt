Affirmation is activist philosophy. It doesn’t believe in one speed. It doesn’t see the in-act only as purposeful activity. Nor does it prioritize a smooth process. It sees activity as rhythm. Affirmation operates at the differential where rhythms co-compose. Cutting across refrains in the making, affirmation intensifies. This intensification is a “becoming-active personified,” a becoming-active that acts from the perspective of the in-act itself. From the perspective of the in-act is another way to say from the perspective of individuation. Individuation is the operational flow of a process. Affirmation cuts into individuation. The cutting affects the process, activating what Simondon calls a dephasing. The dephasing is how the individuation personifies. It is how the individuation makes its conditions of existence known. The dephasing creates the conditions for quality to become felt as such. In the transduction that ensues—the shift in level that creates a new process—the process’s differential comes to the fore. Key to affirmation is this dephasing of the in-act, the differential rhythm that activates a new process. Each dephasing opens the way for a new qualitative field, and it is this qualitative difference that affirmation affirms.
