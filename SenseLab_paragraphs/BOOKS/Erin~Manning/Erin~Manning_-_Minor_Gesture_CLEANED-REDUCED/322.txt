The inflection is the point at which a tending breaks off, the point where a vague incipiency becomes a directionality. This directionality need not be a trajectory. It is less a point in space than an intensity that morphs the line that has formed in the moving. Perceiving the inflection does not mean being aware of it as though you could be outside it. It means moving in its tending. It means attending, in the event, to how movement diverges from its flow, attending to how movement moves.
