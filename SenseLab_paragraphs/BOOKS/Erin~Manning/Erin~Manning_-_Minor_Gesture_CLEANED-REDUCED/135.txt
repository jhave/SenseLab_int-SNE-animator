The emphasis on the ontogenesis of time is important: the quality of the way depends on there not being a notion of time or space that preexists the event of expression art creates. This is not to deny the past, but to say instead that what exists in experience is not a linear timeline but “various levels of contraction” (Deleuze 1991: 74). The manner of existence is how experience contracts, dilates, expands.
