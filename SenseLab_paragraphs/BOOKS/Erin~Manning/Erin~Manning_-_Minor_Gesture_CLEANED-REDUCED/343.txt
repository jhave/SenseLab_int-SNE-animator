Where agency returns to the identity of a precomposed category, agencement speaks to the interstitial arena of experience of the interval, an interval not of the category but in the pre of categorization where the field is still in formation. In Deleuze and Guattari’s A Thousand Plateaus, Brian Massumi translates the untranslatable agencement with “assemblage.”16 Unfortunately, assemblage has too often been read as an object or existent configuration, rather than in its potentializing directionality. This is why I return to the French term here. Agencement, which carries within itself a sense of movement and connectibility, of processual agency, is used first in A Thousand Plateaus with relation to the book. A book, Deleuze and Guattari argue, is an agencement. They write: There is no difference between what a book talks about and how it is made. Therefore a book also has no object. As an assemblage [agencement], a book has only itself, in connection with other assemblages [agencements] and in relation to other bodies without organs. We will never ask what a book means, as signified or signifier; we will not look for anything to understand in it. We will ask what it functions with, in connection with what other things it does or does not transmit intensities, in which other multiplicities its own are inserted and metamorphosed, and with what bodies without organs it makes its own converge. (1987: 4)
