If art is one way that the crossing of the threshold occurs, how does the passage from the multiple to multiplicity occur? How does rituality as the force of form that opens the everyday to its more-than exact from ritual a bringing to expression of a minor gesture that is operative in the artistic realm? Can artistic objects carry the double-articulation of ritual objects? For without at least an echo of this double-articulation, it seems to me, the object risks operating only denotatively. The object risks remaining countable, perceived only as the sum of its parts. What is of interest to me is what techniques are necessary to activate the more-than of objectness within the artistic context, what techniques are necessary to give the object the opportunity to take on the aura, as Walter Benjamin (2008) might say, of another kind of newly invented value, a value activated in the setting that transduces the everyday object into an artful one.
