What struck me, in reading these reviews (can these still be called reviews?), was how fragile this gesture of writing-with made me feel. The fragility, I think, has to do with writing pushed to a limit where it is truly in contact with the tremulousness of thinking in the act. Bringing thought into contact with its limit this way is a minor gesture. It is a minor gesture in that it activates a tendency already in germ and emboldens it toward an altering of what that tendency can do. A thought less concerned with the certainty of what it knows is more open to the minor in thinking, more open to the force of the as-yet-unformed coursing through it. This minor tendency values the force of form, not just the form knowledge takes.
The Minor Gesture engages directly with this tension between knowledge and value. What else could be at stake in the encounter if it weren’t organized around the certainty of knowing? What might become thinkable if knowledge weren’t so tied to an account of subject-driven agency? And, what else might value look like if it weren’t framed by judgment?
