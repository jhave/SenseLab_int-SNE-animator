The account of facilitation as extra to the autistic, where the “successful” autistic is the one who no longer needs facilitation, is built on a neurotypical identity politics that takes subject-based agency as its driving force. Nowhere in this account is there room to consider how agencement works in the event of communication, or even how facilitation is also part of neurotypically inflected experience. Agencement, it bears repeating, is not an action directed by an existing subject, but a force of distributed directionality in the event. Each event, including the event of facilitated communication, crafts tendencies toward subjectivation, sometimes leaving traces that connect to subjects in the making, sometimes not. What I want to argue is this: in the navigation of experience, no one is ever alone, and no experience ever emerges without the facilitation of a process that carries the event in its coming to formation.
