In the context of the choreographic in its relation to dance, it is always compelling, I find, to explore the share of movement that “remains,” that is “left over” in the passage from force to form. This is particularly perceptible in the work of choreographer William Forsythe. In rehearsal, Forsythe repeatedly encourages his dancers to “leave behind” the form of the movement in order to explore what exceeds its form, its representational stature. I have written about this in terms of the “what else,” asking what else movement can do in its fielding of relation. It seems to me that the what else is of central importance in Kawakubo’s so-called deconstructive work, a gesture that once again brings architecture and fashion together, not in terms of scale or form, but in terms of what is left behind. How, for instance, has what takes shape altered, refigured, reoriented past ecologies of fashion in the making? How has its operation incited a reengagement with inheritance? The garments portrayed in the images from the spring–summer 2011 collection (figs. 4.10–4.11) are particularly interesting in this regard. What is at stake here is not simply the making apparent of the seams of the garment’s production but a foregrounding of the immanent potentiality in the seams, at the edges, in the linings of the garment. The infinite line returns here, but where it goes is not toward the kimono. The kimono is perhaps what the form could have been. The garment pictured is what was left behind.
