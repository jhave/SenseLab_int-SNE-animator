Idle No More began as teach-ins throughout Saskatchewan in the fall of 2012, sparked by three First Nations women and one non-Native ally. The original aim of Jessica Gordon, Sylvia McAdam, Sheelah McLean, and Nina Wilson was to provide Canadians with information about the impending Bill c-45 and its impacts on Aboriginal Rights and Protections. Soon thereafter, Chief Theresa Spence of the Attawapiskat Cree Nation announced that she would add her support to the movement with a hunger strike on Parliament Hill, hoping to also bring attention to the deplorable housing conditions on her reserve. An undercommons was bornâ€”a field without firm limits, an opening for thought, an environment for action of all speeds and slownesses. Its net soon widened. Others began to see their place in it, their nonplace.
