She is a fugitive public. Fugitive because she keeps bad debts, fugitive because she does not begin her encounter by identifying herself. Fugitive because she is unrecognizable. Only the credited are known to us, for they are the private individuals, the counted ones. She is beyond count, beyond position. She’s too busy moving to where the studying takes her. She is of the undercommons, the fragile net that sometimes grows around her, the place where debts are gathered and shared, but never paid off. The undercommons is not a community, and nor is the fugitive public. Tem-
porary, uneasy, surprising, these are emergent collectivities that becomeactive in the untimeliness of an eternal return. For they are always there, and always new.
Fugitive publics do not need to be restored. They need to be conserved, which is to say moved, hidden, restarted with the same joke, the same story, always elsewhere than where the long arm of the creditor seeks them, conserved from restoration, beyond justice, beyond law, in bad country, in bad debt. They are planned when they are least expected, planned when they don’t follow the process, planned when they escape policy, evade governance, forget themselves, remember themselves, have no need of being forgiven. They are not wrong though they are not, finally, communities; they are debtors at distance, bad debtors, forgotten but never forgiven. (Moten and Harney 2013: 64)
Fugitive publics do not wait for a space to present itself for their gathering. They invent the spacetimes of study’s composition. They invent the university.
