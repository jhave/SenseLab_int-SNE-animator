This is a political call. The identity politics of neurotypicality are too dominant and too pervasive for autistics to fight alone. Carrying the feeling is not an individual practice. It is collective at its very core. Carrying the feeling is a relational movement, relational in its capacity to make felt the intercurrent, as James might say, of the in-act and the act. Here, where life is not directed by inhibition, and modes of expression entangle the conscious and the nonconscious, where the nonvoluntary finds its poetic voice, new ways of living become imaginable. What if parsing weren’t foregrounded as the method for successful living? What if the nonvoluntary weren’t such a threat? What if freedom were more widely understood as the creative force of the in-act? What if the minor gesture, in its poetic force, were not only attended to, but composed with? What else would we be capable of thinking-feeling?
