There is violence here, and to negate the violence would be reactive. Affirmation is tragic. There is no question that the will to power, that the power of the differential, involves an act that could be called violent. The minor gesture is not immune to that violence. Even the most imperceptible forces of change can have great effects, and those effects can be destructive. Think of the way a tsunami erupts from the most indiscernible activity. Affirmation does not deny the violence. On the contrary, the work of affirmation involves affirming the violence in order to activate its more-than, in order to make felt what, in violence, can cause the decisive turn, in the event, that opens it to a qualitative difference that really makes a difference. “Thinking is the n-th power of thought. It is still necessary for it to become ‘light,’ ‘affirmative,’ ‘dancing.’ But it will never attain this power if forces do not do violence to it.
