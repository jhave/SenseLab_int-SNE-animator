Kawakubo resists being cornered into ethnicity. Where she comes from is an accident of birth, her husband, Adrian Joffe, reminds a journalist. This is not to say that the country of her birth has no effect on her practice. What it means is that with the creation of new modes of existence come new tentative ways of siting oneself. Historical memory crosses over, of course, but Kawakubo is firm: her practice is never a replaying of history as a simple score. What matters for her is not the cradle of inheritance, but the force of form that pushes experience to its limit.
