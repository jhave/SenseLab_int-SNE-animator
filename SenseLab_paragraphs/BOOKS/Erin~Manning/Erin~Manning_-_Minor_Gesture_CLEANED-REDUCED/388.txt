Blackman explains: “Eventually as an adult I came to understand that other people could stand still because the world around them was triangulated. That is they could work out distance from something from their own depth perception. They could then feel their feet (or their bottom if they were sitting down) as another point in this metaphorical triangle” (2013: 9). Autistic perception, because of its direct engagement with the field in-forming, does not privilege the kind of triangulation Blackman believes facilitates standing still in the neurotypical population. Because parsing comes more slowly, stability remains evasive. The irony is that triangulation is not actually how neurotypicals move—it is simply how they account for their movement in the backgrounding that comes through conscious reappraisal. After the fact, in the account that returns volition to the subject, we parse our movements as though planned in advance to operate in this or that specific arrangement. In the event, however, as I outlined in the last chapter, movement has more to do with incipient choreographies of movement-moving than with subject-directed agency. At issue is therefore not simply the question of parsing, but how directionality is allied to incipiency. What might a technique look like that facilitated a kind of movement-moving that privileged the welter of autistic perception?
