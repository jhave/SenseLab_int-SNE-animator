Writing refuses to come linearly? Mobilize the words in the moving. Stand! Run! Jump! Wave your arms! Huddle, vocalize: whatever it takes. Because this is where the thinking happens, this is where language resides, a language that does not need to come out in words, a language in the bodying. A language in the bodying takes the shape of enthusiasm: it shapes desire in the moving. “A truly materialist psychiatry can be defined . . . by a double operation: introducing desire into the mechanism, and introducing production into desire” (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 22, translation modi-
fied).
