Going through the review process for The Minor Gesture, I had the luck of encountering thinking at the limit. In an affirmative gesture—what I call “affirmation without credit” in the postscript—the reviewers took time to think-with the text in a gesture of writing-with, returning The Minor Gesture to me with the richness of an engagement that was capable of opening my thinking beyond where I thought it could go. In this return, I received not a simple account of how writing performs knowledge, but something much more important: an engagement with how thinking does its work, in the writing.
