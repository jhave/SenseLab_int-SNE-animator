The artful is not about a form, or a content—it is the capacity to make felt, in the event-time of a work’s composition, how an object is already a field of relation, a differential variability. For the artful, alive with minor gestures, and engaged in the rituality of the crossing of the threshold in more than one direction, is always already collective in the sense that the how of its process is an uncountable, unparsable multiplicity. The artful celebrates the art of participation, making felt how an ecology can become expressive, and tuning that making-expressive toward the generation of an aesthetic yield, aesthetic in its original definition of making sensible, making felt.
