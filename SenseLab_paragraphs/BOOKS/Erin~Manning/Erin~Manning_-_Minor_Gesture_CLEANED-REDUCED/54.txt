In our everyday movements, especially in relation to movements that have become habitual, a movement might nonetheless feel completely volitional. When this is the case, what has happened is that we’ve experienced a sense of déjà-felt, in the event. This déjà-felt occurs in the interstices of the conscious and the nonconscious, directing the event to its familiarityin-feeling. What is important to realize, and what I explore further in chapter 7, is that the feeling of volition is not volition itself. The feeling of volition is more aptly defined as a certain recognition, in the moving, of our having already moved “just this way.” But movement-moved is never twice the same: it is always altered by the ecologies that create this singular field of relation, and that influence how it will unfold this time. Volitional movement understood as movement belonging to the subject and fully directed by the subject is, therefore, impossible. Such an account of volition, as suggested above, can only be narrated after the fact. This post facto narration of our movements as volitional is of course more straightforward if the act maintains a certain similarity across variations. Major movements— movements that have a form that can easily be recognized, such as getting on the bus—are therefore more easily post-identified as “volitional” than are minor gestures.
