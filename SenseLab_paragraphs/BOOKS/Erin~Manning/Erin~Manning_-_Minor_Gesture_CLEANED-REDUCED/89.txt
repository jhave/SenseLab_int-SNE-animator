In the crafting of his account of the function of reason, Whitehead begins with a definition of life. The art of life, he writes, is “first to be alive, secondly to be alive in a satisfactory way, and thirdly to acquire an increase in satisfaction” (1929: 8). The main point Whitehead seeks to make here is that the lively push to acquiring an increase in satisfaction cannot be limited to a doctrine of the “survival of the fittest.”6 “In fact life itself is comparatively deficient in survival value. The art of persistence is to be dead. Only inorganic things persist for great lengths of time. A rock survives for eight hundred million years; whereas the limit for a tree is about a thousand years, for a man or an elephant about fifty or one hundred years, for a dog about twelve years, for an insect about one year” (1929: 5–6). “Why,” he asks, “has the trend of evolution been upwards? The fact that organic species have been produced from inorganic distributions of matter, and the fact that in the lapse of time organic species of higher and higher types have evolved, are not in the least explained by any doctrine of adaptation to the environment, or of struggle” (1929: 7). Reason, he suggests, may be one way to account for the upward evolution, and, in particular, to the increase of satisfaction occasioned by the art of living. His conclusion: the function of reason is to direct the otherwise anarchic field of relation toward its actualization (1929: 1). Reason is that which “realizes the possibility of some complex form of definiteness, and concurrently understands the world as, in one of its factors, exemplifying that form of definiteness” (1929: 9).
