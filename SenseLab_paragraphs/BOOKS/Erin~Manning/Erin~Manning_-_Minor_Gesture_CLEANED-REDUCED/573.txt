Existence’s debt recognizes itself in the shape preformed of the human. When we imagine what is owed to us, we imagine it taking the shape of an individual or a collection of individuals. This kind of debt grows around the individual and is contained by the individual. Harney writes: “There has to be a way in which there can be elaborations of unpayable debt that don’t always return to an individualization through the family or an individualization through the wage laborer, but instead the debt becomes a principle of elaboration” (2013: 151). What would it look like to think of debt without a subject?
Debt without a subject would spin centrifugally. Debt would become a figure uncontainable, an ungraspable force. As a principle of elaboration, debt would become the motor of another kind of process, one that doesn’t always lead back to us, to the human as central pivot of experience. Debt would instead become the unfathomable superabundance we carry not because we have no choice, but because, as more-than, we can share the weight, and we welcome that sharing.
