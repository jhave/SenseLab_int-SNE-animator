In the case of Song Dong’s Waste Not, I would say that the minor gesture was more palpable at the Sydney Biennale, where his work extended beyond the walls of the gallery into the outdoor space. At the Moscow Biennale, where his work felt contained by a wall of cardboard boxes that served to mark the edge of the collection, the effect was less operative. Even though in Sydney the participant saw the same objects and was similarly kept from handling them or altering their taxonomy, the space itself seemed to activate a pull from object to object, and from object to the empty frame of Song Dong’s mother’s house. This pull activated the interval of objectness, opening the multiple to multiplicity and thus making felt the uncountability of the excess at the heart of the project. In Moscow, however, the minor gesture seemed to lay more dormant. This may have been because the boundary created around the work kept the participant firmly within the work’s maze, and kept the work itself from engaging relationally with the other works in the exhibition.
