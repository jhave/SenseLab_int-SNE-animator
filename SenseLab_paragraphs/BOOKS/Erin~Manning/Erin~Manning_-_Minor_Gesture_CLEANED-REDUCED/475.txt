Bifo’s argument, over the last decade, is that neoliberalism has left the body disempowered, our collective nervous system besieged by the forces of a capitalist takeover. We can, and indeed, we must no longer act. As outlined by Gary Genosko and Nicholas Thoburn in their introduction to Bifo’s After the Future, Bifo argues that “activism is the narcissistic response of the subject to the infinite and invasive power of capital, a response that can only leave the activist frustrated, humiliated and depressed” (Genosko and Thoburn in Berardi 2011: 7). Activism, Bifo suggests, is a desperate attempt to ward off depression. “But it’s doomed to fail and, worse, to convert political innovation and sociality into its opposite, to ‘replace desire with duty’” (2011: 7–8).
