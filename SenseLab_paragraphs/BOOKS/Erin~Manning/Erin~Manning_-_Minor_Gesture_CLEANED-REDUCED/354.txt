Choreographic thinking is a proposition to movement-moving that asks how the plane of experience composes, how it remembers, how it becomes, and how it takes form, all in the register of the more-than-human. It is an everyday activity that tunes habits and invents techniques. At its best, it is an operative technicity that opens experience to emergent collectivity. For its focus is never on the body per se. What moves it choreographically is not first and foremost a body. It is rhythm, a cut in duration, a field of resonance, an interval.
