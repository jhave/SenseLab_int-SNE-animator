“Choreography starts from any point,” writes William Forsythe (in Casperson 2000: 33). Choreography co-composes with the event’s point of inflection. It cleaves an occasion, activating its relational potential. It makes time, beginning its process anew always from the midst of the event. Choreography is thus a proposition to the event. It asks the event how its ecology might best generate and organize the force of movement-moving.
Choreographic agencement is a complex of experience that in itself cannot be mapped. What emerges choreographically is less an organization of bodies than a cartography of incipient tendencies, of force of form. In this sense, choreography is less about a body than about an ecology. This ecology is more-than-human, composed as much of the force of atmosphere, of duration, of rhythm, than it is of something we might call the body-envelope. This more-than is not activated by decisions in the standard sense of being willed by the individual, but by the immanent creation, in the event, of points of inflection that affect the very tenor of movementmoving. How we cue and align to these inflections, how we move with intervals in the making, is spurred by an activating cut immanent to the process that cleaves the event, creating a vectoring into contrast. Decision in the moving—like thought in the moving—is the event of tendencies colliding such that they coalesce in the time-slip of the new, spurred into invention by the ecology of the dance itself.
