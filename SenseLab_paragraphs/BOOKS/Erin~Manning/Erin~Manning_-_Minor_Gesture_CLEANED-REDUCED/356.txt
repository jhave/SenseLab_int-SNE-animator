This has effects for political thought. The agencements of event-time open the way for what Guattari calls an ecosophy, a politics both ethicopolitical and aesthetic. Such a politics is as far as one can get from a politics of individual or group identity. It begins instead directly with the agencement active in movement-moving, gathering not around the individual but around what Guattari calls a group-subject, the collective momentum of a field of relation cueing and aligning to modes of thought in the making. This is not to entirely background the individual. Of course the individual reemerges at key moments, but always as transindividual: the force of form activated in the ecology of practices is tuned here such that what makes a difference does so at the level of the collective rather than through what are perceived as individual acts. Following Simondon, think the individual in this context less as an initiator of experience than as one of the ways in which the field inflection comes to determinate expression.
In his work at La Borde, a psychiatric clinic founded by Jean Oury, Guattari’s focus was on the schizoanalytic encounter with group-subjectivity. For Guattari, creating and defining new forms of subjectivity was urgent, for it was only in the practice of rethinking the subject in the analytical context that the dominant paradigm of the psychoanalytic, where the subject is very much predefined, could be sidestepped, creating a platform for neurodiversity. La Borde was an ideal site for this kind of research. Peter Pál Pelbart explains: “La Borde was a polyphonic laboratory. And it’s true: someone who suffers from psychosis is completely deterritorialized from the subject, immediately. In other words, the subjectivities and the subjectivations have absolutely nothing to do with the identity of the subject before us. All of this allows all sorts of entities from elsewhere to proliferate.”
