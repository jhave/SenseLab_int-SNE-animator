I am not alone in my wariness. The First Nations listened to the apology, recognized the debt, acknowledged it, but refused the credit.9 Instead they continued the mobilizations that have become part of the activism of indigenous necessity, and they made themselves heard, again (we have never been good at listening). The power of the false, it turns out, was alive and well within Indigenous communities, vivid in the fabulations passed from generation to generation in the oral histories that are there not only to weave the traces of the past into the present, but to turn time on itself. With the force of fabulation as the motor, new stories were generated and shared, and with them a process of emergent planning was born. Idle No More was born.10
