In doing so, I do not want to discredit the fact that there is extensive turmoil in the face of neoliberalism’s excessive takeover of what a body can do. There is no question that these are troubled times. Nor do I want to suggest that depression isn’t terrible. It is. What I want to do, always with the ndeup ritual in mind—with its belief that depression carries a more-than that needs to be attended to in its differential force; with its acknowledgment that it is only collectively that new modes of existence can be invented—is propose that depression operates in event-time, not outside the event in a passive relationship to the what was. If we start here, the inquiry leads somewhere profoundly different than the path Bifo outlines. Against Bifo’s account of the neoliberal takeover of the act, this different path leads us toward a rethinking of the in-act, as I’ve attempted to do throughout, a rethinking that leads to a neurodiverse exploration of the what else at the heart of experience.
