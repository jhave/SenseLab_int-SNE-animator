Such responses to the collection depend on preexisting categories not only as regards the fashion, but also as regards the body. What if we look further, taking Kawakubo’s procedural fashioning at its word? What if instead of beginning from what we know, from the habits of fashion, we began in an encounter with tentativeness? “Persons need to be rescued from self-certainty, but they also need to put their tentativeness in precise order in relation to works of architecture” (Arakawa and Gins 2002: 50).
In the “Dress Becomes Body” collection, a shaping occurs. Why must we assume that this shaping hides a body? Why not instead take this shaping for what it is, as the event in itself, an event that includes a body-world co-composition? What if instead of assuming that the person is not the shape, we were open to a different concept of personing that included its architecting? Arakawa and Gins speak of “organism that persons.” Could this be what is at stake in “Dress Becomes Body”?
