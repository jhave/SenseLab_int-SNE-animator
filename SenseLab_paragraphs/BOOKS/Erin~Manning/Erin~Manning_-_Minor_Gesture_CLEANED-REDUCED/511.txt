Autistic perception sees-feels the workings of desire, its machining, its facilitating. It feels the workings of desire in the patterns Baggs writes about, in the mobility in Bissonnette’s metaphors, in the “killingly difficult” of Chammi’s description of coming to language. What is perceived at this desiring interstice is the field itself in all its complexity, where, to quote Deleuze and Guattari again, “everything functions at the same time but amid hiatuses and ruptures, breakdowns and failures, stalling and shortcircuits, distances and fragmentations, a sum that never succeeds in bringing its various parts together to form a whole” (1983: 42, translation modified). Productive disjunction, or, in Deleuze and Guattari’s vocabulary, inclusive disjunction; a panoply of indecipherable effects, directly felt, actively desiring in the rhythm of a collective oinking.
