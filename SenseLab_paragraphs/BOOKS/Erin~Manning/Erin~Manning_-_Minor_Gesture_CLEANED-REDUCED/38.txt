With the undercommons as beacon for emergent collectivity, and study, or research-creation, as its mode of engagement, this book attempts to get away from asking questions that already contain their answers. “What I would want to do is not so much keep producing questions but to step to the side of the question a bit and think through the importance of study— that it might be possible to imagine a form of movement or political mobilization that would be driven by or centered on the activity of study in a way that does not require the figuration of the student, or potentially some sort of reification of the figure of the student” (Bousquet, Harney, and Moten 2009: 160). Study, like research-creation, refutes the “subject” of study, and in so doing it also refuses the “object of study.” It does so by always beginning with the creation of a problem that is truly productive of inquiry. In so doing, it opens the field of experience to the more-than of objects or subjects preformed. Study is an act that delights in the activation of the as-yet-unthought. It is an activity of immanent critique, as I argue in chapter 1, an act that only knows the conditions of its existence from within its own process, an act that refuses to judge from without. Study, researchcreation—these are pragmatically speculative practices that, while absolutely entrenched in their own process of making-time, here, now, remain untimely. For as practices, they activate event-time, the time unparsed of the intuitive, a concept I explore further in chapter 2, inventing problems that have no home, no reference yet. Such problems need a collective to answer them; they need the undercommons. They require study. And, it bears repeating: what emerges from study will never be an answer. What emerges will be patient experimentation. What emerges will be another mode of encounter, another problem, another opening onto the political as site as yet undefined.
