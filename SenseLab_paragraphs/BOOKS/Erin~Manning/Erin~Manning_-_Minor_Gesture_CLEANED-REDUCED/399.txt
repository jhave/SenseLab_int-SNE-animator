Here, the lack of impulse-control becomes its own kind of foothold on experience, fostering as it does an agencement not directly allied to the feeling of the event at hand, but to a spectral feeling activated in the repetition of a memory. A kind of short-circuit of nonsensuous perception takes over, the past fielding the present against what the current moment desires. Two event-paths collide. The more-than is here revealed in all of its contradictions as the surplus that should have been excluded. But this is the effect of autistic perceptionâ€”that exclusion is difficult. Lack of inhibition has its advantages and its disadvantages.
