Truths-in-the-making are fabulations: they are affirmative intercessors into the everyday that come alive at the interstices where narration composes with the ineffable. These truths, these fabulations, are too often silenced by the “first” cut which holds the power to create a tight circle that only leads us back to one narrative, to one way of accounting for experience. Fabulation tells life differently. Beyond interpretation.
What the force of fabulation draws out, what it makes felt, is that there was not really a “first” cut. This “first” cut was just the most intensive of the myriad cuts that propel experience. It may be the cut that mattered most, in retrospect, but has its mattering too forcefully backgrounded the ecological nature of experience? Has it silenced the minor gestures that choreograph life-living? When the first is transduced into the myriad, when the ecology of practices is foregrounded and the event opens itself to the not-yet of experience in the making, there may be the potential of a shift that, while not denying the horrors, perceives the more-than that was always also alive in the cut. This more-than may be the motor for another kind of refrain. A refrain that honors the horror, but this time in the tragic joy of a dramatization that affirms difference. Schizoanalysis.
