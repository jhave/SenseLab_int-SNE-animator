A minor gesture is a living variation. For the object to become artful, conditions must be created that open the event to variability. What matters is not what the object represents, but what it can do. To foreground what an object can do involves activating its ecology of practices, opening it to its differential. To do so, it is imperative, it seems to me, to include, to make participatory, the ecology of which it is part. This ecology is as much at the heart of the object “itself ” as in its seriality. Too often, the art exhibition holds the object to itself as though it were internally bound. In a similar gesture, it foregrounds individual work instead of activating the environment, or foregrounding the relational force between works. Organizing an exhibition according to the emergent ecologies it might call forth as a mobile environment might be one way of making operative immanent minor gestures, in return encouraging the participant, the spectator, the visitor to the gallery, to see art not as a denotative, individual statement, but as an emergent collective articulation that includes what an object can do.
