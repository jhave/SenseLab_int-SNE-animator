This is Deleuze and Guattari’s definition of the desiring machine. Depression is not missing from Anti-Oedipus—the complexity of neurodiversity is everywhere present in the account of what schizoanalysis can do. What’s absent is a separating out of depression from neurodiversity as a whole. Anti-Oedipus foregrounds transversal operations that propose techniques for creating desiring machines that are capable of cutting through existing systems to create new modes of existence. Psychoanalysis is one of the systems Anti-Oedipus’s desiring machines cuts through. Anti-Oedipus works against any account that would restratify a neurotypical identity politics or any normative identity structure. For theirs is an exploration, avant la lettre, of what neurodiversity can do, not of its failings. To suggest otherwise would be to discredit the force of schizoanalysis so central to Guattari’s practice.
