The complex ecology of a process outdoing itself that is made operational by the minor gesture is felt, in its intensity, in the artful: the artful is palpably transindividual. In the context of art as manner, artfulness is therefore closer to the differential than to any object, a differential that has been activated through the punctuality of a minor gesture’s movement through the process. This is not to suggest that the crafting of operational problems through intuition, the activation of minor gestures through sympathy for the event, the coming-into-expression of artfulness are quickly or easily done: when writing about intuition’s role in the crafting of a problem, Bergson speaks of the necessity of a long camaraderie engendered by a relationship of trust that leads toward an engagement with that which goes beyond premature observations and preconceived neutralizing facts (in Lapoujade 2008: 12). Intuition is a rigorous process that agitates at the very limits of an encounter with the as-yet-unthought. Artfulness is the sympathetic expression of this encounter.
Tapping into the differential, artfulness opens the world to the kind of novelty Whitehead foregrounds—a novelty not concerned with the capitalist sense of the newest new, but novelty as the creation of mixtures that produce new openings, new vistas, new complexions for experience in the making. This novelty can never be reduced to art as object: only the artful is truly capable of activating new mixtures.
