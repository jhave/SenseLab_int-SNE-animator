Modes of existence as they are crafted out of ecologies of practices are never primarily human. They are ecological, active at the interstices of what life is becoming, life understood not only in terms of the vital, but as an active vector that passes through the organic and the inorganic. Life as lifeliving, as force of form invented in the cut that cleaves experience, opening it to new modes of existence.
