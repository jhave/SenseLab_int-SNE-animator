What moves here is not the human per se, but the force of the direction the intuition gave the event in its preliminary unfolding paired with the force of a minor gesture. Techniques are at work, modulating themselves to outdo their boundedness toward a technicity in germ. Thought, intent, organization, consideration, habit, experienceâ€”all of these are at work. With them comes the germ of intuition born of a long and patient process now being activated by a sympathy for difference, a sympathy for the event in its uneasy becoming. To touch on the artful is to touch on the incommensurable more-than that is everywhere active in the ecologies that make us and exceed us.
