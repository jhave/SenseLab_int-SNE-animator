Savarese asks Mukhopadhyay: “What can poetry communicate that prose cannot? You’ve spoken of your ‘love for designs’ and ‘repetition’ when writing? Can you speak more about this love? Beyond the fact that rhyme and repetition seem themselves somehow autistic (in a good way), what do they communicate?” (Savarese 2010). This question is key, it seems to me, in the question of facilitation. How does the movement of rhythm, the tone or taste of words, all of these present in poetry, facilitate the passage from autistic perception to language-based communication? Mukhopadhyay responds: “They make me think about a sound pattern. Designs can be visual and designs can be formed in sound. When I write, ‘A rock lay by the stream,’ it becomes less of a design than something like . . . A rock lay waiting / By the stream / Ready to step inside, / So that it could begin / An existence—Of a stepping stone! (Whatever be that meaning.) The words make the rock become more than a thing to ignore” (Savarese 2010).
More than a thing to ignore might also be understood as “more than a thing to inhibit.” For the neurotypical, might this mean that poetic writing is a facilitator in its own right, activating perception in a way that bypasses the habitual inhibition that occurs in the parsing of the event? For there is no question, it seems to me, that poetry, with its foregrounding of rhythm and sonority over a bald attempt at sense-making, acts as facilitator in autistic writing, and perhaps even autistic experience in general: in the same interview with Savarese, Mukhopadhyay mentions that it was William Blake who helped him learn to tie his shoes!
