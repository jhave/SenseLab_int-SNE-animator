Being is born of becoming. Affirmation cuts into becoming to create being. This being is always more-than. It is an emergent constellation before it is a form. The field does not begin and end in form: it erupts into form, and then dephases into new processes that create an opening for new deviations. Speciations abound, and with them fugitive publics take form and then move along. Places of refuge grow and are fabulated into new constellations. Undercommons emerge and disappear. When being is born of becoming, the way the event settles has not been choreographed in advance. When being is born of becoming, the deviations of experience have not yet expressed themselves in a form preconstituted. Experience is a univocal force, not a simple unity. It is all that it is, in its full becoming, and always more than one in its full being. Both-and.
