The ritual object’s role is to synergize the event, opening the field of experience to the emergent force of this singular collective setting in this singular spacetime of composition. The object is a dynamic form in the activation of what it will come to be through the rite. What the object will become, what it will be able to do, will depend on how the conditions for the event have been crafted. Techniques for crossing the threshold from the everyday into rituality and back are vital: if the conditions aren’t right, the transduction cannot occur. The crossing of the threshold must every time be invented anew. The ritual must be capable of activating not the object-as-such, the activity-in-itself, but the shift in register embodied in the crossing of the threshold. The material quality of the object is important only insofar as it is able to carry experience elsewhere.
