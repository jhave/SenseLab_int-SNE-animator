Perhaps the best place to begin is, once again, with movement. Neurotypically inflected movement is usually taken to be voluntary. As outlined in the last chapter, the presupposition tends to be that the subject moves the movement. I want an apple, I reach for an apple, I take the apple into my hand, I move the apple to my mouth, I bite the apple. The neurotypical takes this sequence for granted, believing that the motion was unfacilitated, placing the “I” at the center of each gesture. The autistic, on the other hand, because of sequencing issues and difficulties with activation, may not be capable of “volitionally” grabbing and eating the apple. The apple may nonetheless get taken and eaten, but it might just as well end up staying on the counter because for some strange reason the body moved away from the table. Voluntary/nonvoluntary would be an easy dichotomy to use to separate out these two experiences. But if instead of beginning with agency we turn to agencement, asking not what the subject did but what the event proposed, another version of the task comes to light.
