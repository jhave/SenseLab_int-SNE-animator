Autie-type, completely composed by the autistic, relishes the relational pull of facilitation: the writing happens in the between, the between not only of autistic and facilitator, but also of autistic perception and language. In this kind of writing, the facilitator may or may not have direct hands-on contact with the autistic. The direct contact is not the issue. Facilitation is in the milieu: it is a virtual carrier of language, but only in the sense that it activates and nurtures the relation. Care for the field in its unfolding is directly felt, it seems to me, in the writing that ensues.
