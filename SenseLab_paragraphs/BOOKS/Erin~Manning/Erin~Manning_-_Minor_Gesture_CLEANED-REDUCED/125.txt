In Romantic languages, where “art” as a word has been retained, mode or manner is eclipsed by a definition of art that emphasizes “the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination.” Art is not only reduced entirely to human expression; it is also synonymous, as the Oxford English Dictionary (oed) would have it, with “visual form . . . appreciated primarily for [its] beauty and emotional power.”1
This current definition of art signals the way the object continues to play a key role in artistic practice, holding art to a passive-active organization that segregates maker from beholder. For those whose practice opens the way toward processual concerns, the oed definition will feel outdated. And yet there is no question that the object’s hold remains strong. I would therefore like to propose a new definition of art-as-practice that begins not with the object, but with what else art can do. I want to propose we engage first and foremost with the manner of practice and not the endresult. What else can artistic practice become when the object is not the goal, but the activator, the conduit toward new modes of existence?
