Weather Patterns is in progress because it fails more often than it succeeds. Glimpses of the artful have been generated in each of the exhibitions of the work, but as an artistic experience, it remains tentative. This is also what keeps it alive. For the tentative is replete with tendency, open to vectors that activate the differential from which the minor gesture can be crafted. Amplifying tendency in the spirit of the tentative, what is most interesting to me about Weather Patterns as it has evolved is its capacity to open itself to problems that invite the process to linger. What has become key to the work is not so much the outcome (though how the work individuates in various exhibitions is central to how it continues to resolve its conditions of emergence), but what kinds of minor gestures are generated in the process. This is why, in 2012, I decided to begin to send the work (as a proposition-on-variation more than as an object or a set of objects) to different artistsâ€”including, so far, choreographer Megan Bridge, sound artist Peter Price, and designer/scholar Samantha Spurr. The work, in its current iteration, has also returned to Nathaniel Stern and Bryan Cera, who will mount it in the context of their own collaborative work, thereby giving it a different inflection. Creating in a crowd, all of us taking as points of departure our own differing approaches to making a work work, makes even more apparent the inherent variability at the heart of the process of creating a weather pattern.
