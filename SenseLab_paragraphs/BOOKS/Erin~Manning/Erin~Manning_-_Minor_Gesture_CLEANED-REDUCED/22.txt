The approach I am taking here, in my calling into question the centrality of neurotypicality as grounding structure for existence as we practice it, might be called schizoanalytic, not because there is an encounter with schizophrenia per se, but because the account involves an engagement with the cleaving of experience. A working definition of schizoanalysis for the purposes of this project might be: the active operation that creates schisms, in an ecology of practices, opening up the event to its potential for a collectivity alive with difference. A concept that composes well with the activity of this cleaving is agencement. Agencement, as Guattari writes, is a junction that “secretes [its own] coordinates, [that] can certainly impose connections, but [does] not impose a fixed constraint” (2013: 24). Mobilizing the cleave of the event, its internal schism, agencement foregrounds not the agency of an individual acting on the event, but those very operations that “secrete their own coordinates” in the event, affecting how it comes to expression. A schizoanalytic approach, as I will elaborate in chapter 8, affirms these complex ecologies that could not come into existence without the schisms that radically alter the operational quality of the event.
