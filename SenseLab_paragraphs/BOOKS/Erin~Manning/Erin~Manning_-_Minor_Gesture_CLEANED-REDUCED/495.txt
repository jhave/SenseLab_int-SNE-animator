Baggs also speaks of feeling patterns: “But I can see the patterns of movement in other people, including cats, whether or not I see them well in the usual forms of visual perception. And those patterns of movement tell me more than any word ever could.”12 These feeling patterns are felt expressions of a language in the making that has not yet expressed itself in words, a language closer to Bissonette’s statement above regarding painting: “Artmaking is like alliance people develop with their muscles after deep massage. You can move freely without effort.” This is nonverbal communication, but it is also more than that. It is a shape of enthusiasm in the sense that it creates a bodying, a feeling of experience in the moving that invents its own time and takes that time, operating mostly at the nonconscious level. Baggs emphasizes this when she says that “forms of nonverbal communication I understand best are unintentional, in fact. That’s one reason tests using actors don’t work on me. I know an autistic woman who failed a test of nonverbal communication because it used actors and she kept describing their real feelings instead of their acted ones.”
