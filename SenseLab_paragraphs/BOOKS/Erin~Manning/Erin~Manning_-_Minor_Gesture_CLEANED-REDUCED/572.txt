Affirmation is the yes of the child’s “again!” (“Was that life? Well then, once more!”). This yes is not a simple acquiescence—Nietzsche warns us of becoming the donkey who is willing to carry any and every load. Affirmation’s yes is a pull to engage with the operative tendencies of a fissure in the field of existence. It is an affirmation of the what if at the heart of the what else. Yes! does not mean “anything goes.” The affirmative yes enjoys the stakes of the event’s process, enjoys the unknowability of the operative cut that moves experience to that which cannot be known in advance. Yes! is an enabling constraint that promises nothing except a pragmatic stance of experimentation, a speculative pragmatism. From this yes!, many nos will follow, but no will never lead the way, for no has too much of a habit of knowing in advance.
Nietzsche writes of two kinds of suffering. There are those “who suffer from the superabundance of life” (Nietzsche 1968 in Deleuze 2002: 16). This suffering says yes! in a way that does not exclude the pain of the everyday. This yes! is not a masochism. It is an affirmation of the force of superabundance. It is a yes! to the more-than. The superabundance is a weight, but it is not the any-weight the donkey carries. It is a weight claimed and made operational in the context not of what life is, but what life can do. It is the weight of a debt unpayable, a debt without credit. The second kind of suffering is consumed with “an impoverishment of life.” Those who suffer this way “make intoxication a convulsion, a numbness; they make suffering a means of accusing life, of contradicting it and also a means of justifying life, of resolving the contradiction” (Nietzsche 1968 in Deleuze 2002: 16). The first is affirmative, the second steeped in ressentiment. The first lives in the in-act of existence unfolding, the second feels the weight of existence’s debt and carries it even while reacting against it.
