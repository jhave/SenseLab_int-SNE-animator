The minor gesture is what activates the work under precise conditions, what makes the attunements of an emerging ecology felt, what makes the work work. It is what tunes the work to its processual force, to what Deleuze and Guattari call “material-forces” as opposed to “matter-form,” referring to how material is already imbued with force (1987: 95). Introducing into the work’s process a kind of continuous variability, a minor gesture makes times felt, but not time as measure: time as duration. This variability, in the event of a work’s becoming artful (a work’s faire oeuvre), makes felt how the work co-composes across the measured time of the object and the a-measure of event-time. The minor gesture foregrounds the art of time. The time of red in fall is felt not simply in calendar-time. It is not simply a feeling of “Oh, here we are again—it’s October.” The weather pattern comes all of a sudden, just this way, iteratively and yet always as though for the first time. A weather pattern, as activated by a minor gesture, creates a direct feeling of variability, a direct experience, in this case, of the rhythm of time tuning to its difference, made active and palpable by how this red (leaf), this (fall) smell, this (October) slant of sun moves the feeling of summer into the feeling of fall. The minor gesture: not the leaf, not the color or the month or even the season, but the internal variability, active in the differential, that tunes this particular ecology to the felt experience of time shifting.
