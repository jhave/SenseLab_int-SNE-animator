Arakawa and Gins define procedural architectures as “overlapping tissues of density” (Gins 1994: 2). Architecture understood this way must be considered beyond the built environment. Procedural architecture is “a world-constituting procedure.”1 It builds worlds more than buildings, its mandate to directly cleave the biosphere, or, in Arakawa and Gins’s vocabulary, “to bioscleave.” The bioscleave procedural architecture fashions never stops cleaving. It is an active, procedural milieu that remains in-act as a persistent reminder that what sites life also cleaves the environment, opening it to its differential. Cleaving cuts open the field of experience. This cut has
the effect of reorienting the field: the cleave, like decision in Whitehead, is the decisional force that activates, that tweaks the in-act toward the punctual creation of life-living.
