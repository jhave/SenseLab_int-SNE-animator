My purpose in starting with Kedar’s experience is not to suggest that the extreme forms of body disturbance—the partial loss of the ability to coordinate and perform skilled, purposeful movements and gestures with accuracy—associated with autism are easy to live with, nor do I want to suggest that autistic perception is ideal in our neurotypically oriented worlds. There is no question that the world we live in is aligned to chunking, and that the quicker we get to perceiving objects and subjects, the easier the everyday is to manage. What I do want to argue is that were we to consider the connection between body disturbance and autistic perception, we might develop a stronger sense of how the neurotypical alignments of experience are limiting as regards the complexity of the body-world ecology. Neurotypical  experience  is  built  on  a  few  key  beliefs.  First,  ablebodiedness is taken for granted as the ideal starting point for existence. Second, independence is put forward based on the idea that self-sufficiency is the goal. A self-sufficient body is regarded as a body that can consciously make decisions based on a strong sense of where the body ends and the world begins. Freedom is defined according to this notion of selfsufficiency. As I suggested in the introduction, these beliefs frame the preva lent and seemingly unshakable triad intentionality-volition-agency.
