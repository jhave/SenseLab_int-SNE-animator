There is a call, an appeal, even a demand that is part of a politics of affirmation, and it is this demand that best counters violence’s capture of the what else in the name of a nihilism that revictimizes. Fred Moten gives a beautiful account of it through the example of Joe McPhee’s playing on Nation Time.21 Using the figure of the soloist in the jazz ensemble to challenge the authoritative voice of the univocal speaker, Moten asks,
What if authoritative speech is detached from the notion of a univocal speaker? What if authoritative speech is actually given in the multiplicity and the multivocality of the demand? This was something that was also happening at that same moment in the music, so that the figure of the soloist was being displaced. Even if the soloist was, in a certain sense, only temporarily occupying a certain kind of sovereign position, the return to collective improvisational practices was sort of saying, “we are making a music which is complex enough and rich enough so that when you listen to it you are hearing multiple voices, multiply formed voices. We are sort of displacing the centrality of the soloist.” (Moten and Harney 2013: 135–136)
