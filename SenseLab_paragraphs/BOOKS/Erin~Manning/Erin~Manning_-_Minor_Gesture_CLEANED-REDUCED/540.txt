Perhaps one of the most concrete ways art and philosophy come together in my practice is around the question of value. Brian and I did a TEDx talk some time ago called “For a Pragmatics of the Useless,” where we were trying to create a vocabulary for a valuing of experience that is not allied to either capitalist market-value or prestige-value.2 Philosophy and art both sit on the side of prestige-value more than on the side of market-value. But the prestige-value obviously has market effects. Some philosophers and artists have chosen a kind of nondoing as a way of responding to the prestige-value of art and philosophy. The problem with this approach is that it simplifies the act, reducing it to a dichotomy (to act or not to act). I would rather operate within a Spinozist frame, where there is an emphasis on rest in movement and movement in rest. I think that there is a lot of doing in the nondoing and a lot of nondoing in the doing. We need to keep that complexity there, focusing perhaps more on the subtleties of the in-act of autistic perception, an in-act that cannot be reduced so easily to form and category, to intentionality and volition. In our TEDx talk, we proposed the reinvigoration of the concept of uselessness, emphasizing a kind of doing, an in-act, where value is not preinscribed but created in the event.
