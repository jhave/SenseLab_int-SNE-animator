Grand gestures operate within the bounds of the possible. They mobilize around the solidity of narratives already composed. These grand gestures, as mentioned in the introduction, are often seen as the site where true political change occurs, but in fact the grand gesture only upholds the status quo. Unlike the minor gesture, which unsettles the field through its affirmation of difference, the grand gesture choreographs the field around a truth that seeks to justify the it is.
