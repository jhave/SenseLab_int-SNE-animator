I emphasize the nonvolitional in the act because so much is taken for granted in the name of neurotypicality, in the name of volition, of intentionality, of agency. For those who pass as neurotypical, for whom movement usually reads as volitional, it seems absolutely acceptable to have listened to the song on the couch instead of walking to the corner to get milk. But for the autistic or anyone else for whom activation and impulse control may be an issue, the daily experience of not ending up where our movement seemed initially to be directed is not only deeply frustrating, but can also be taken as a sign of our lesser value as human beings: anything that makes us less independent in the eyes of a world that takes intentionality and volition as a normative standard tends to decrease our perceived value as contributors to society.
