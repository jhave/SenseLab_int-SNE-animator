Growing up means contending with a neurotypically oriented world, which in turn means dealing with the importance given to intentionality. “I don’t know why initiating is so hard,” writes Kedar, voicing what I am certain is one of the most discouraging aspects of autism. Autistic motor disturbance is certainly the main reason many autistics are not perceived to be capable of thinking for themselves. And yet it is likely this very difficulty that makes autistic perception prevalent and that allows autistics to dwell longer in the still-composing precategorized field of relation.5 It is also this openness to experience in-forming at the edges where body and environment are not yet two that explains the fact that most if not all autistics are synesthetic. As Kedar describes: “If I hear some music I get hot or cold. It’s like a full sensory experience of sound, sight and temperature. . . . It’s interesting to experience things on more than one sensory level. . . . To see music takes music to another level, however it is also possible for me to get overwhelmed because my senses bombard me with so much information” (2012: 73).
