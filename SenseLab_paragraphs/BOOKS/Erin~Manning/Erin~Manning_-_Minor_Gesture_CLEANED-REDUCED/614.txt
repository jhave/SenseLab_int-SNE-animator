The gesture of reconciliation claims to give voice to the Indigenous people. Through the reconciliatory rhetoric, Harper asks forgiveness in the name of Canadians. He claims to recognize that there are ongoing effects of what amounts to cultural genocide. But what does the act actually give voice to? What does it mobilize? What work does this grand gesture do other than get us, we the ones who stand firmly on the side of nonvictims in the indigenous context, off the hook? For doesn’t it simply once again set the stage into two camps—those who have the power to speak, and those who must listen (and forgive)? Doesn’t this grand narrative that puts the abuses in the past risk silencing the indigenous, for whom the either/or option of forgiveness may just not be an option, especially given the context of ongoing practices of colonization?
