For an object to become artful in the context of the gallery, it must be capable of inventing its own value. Even more so, it must be capable of activating it. It cannot therefore simply be a comment on the art market, or a comment on culture.4 While it can comment, and art often does in important and unique ways, it has to create a site of encounter that makes the cultural field tremulous, opening it to its minor gestures. The object becomes artful when its value is truly invented in its crossing of the threshold, in the passing from one site to another, and when this value continues to metamorphose in the field of variation the old-new object creates. To become artful, the object must be capable of carrying the potential for variation.
