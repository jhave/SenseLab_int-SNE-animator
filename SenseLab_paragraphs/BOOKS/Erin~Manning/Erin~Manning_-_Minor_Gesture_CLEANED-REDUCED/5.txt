For their elegant engagement with collective thinking in the act, I thank these reviewers by name: Greg Seigworth and Fred Moten. Thank you for inviting me to think beyond the limit of what seemed thinkable, and for thinking there with me.
I also thank the SenseLab, with whom the thinking never stops, whether we are making or moving or talking or writing. My life is changed, continuously, by the thinking that moves us.
