On the one hand, the public becomes the judge of the work, and on the other hand, the artist becomes judge of the public’s judgment. Even in the best of situations, a certain prescribed hierarchy cannot but emerge. Not only does this deaden the force of what a practice can do, it limits participation to a predefined definition of a public, which inevitably orients participation to human intervention, curtailing the more complex ecology of participation. As activator after the event, this human presence now has the task of bringing into being this new phase of the practice. While this can be successful in the sense that it can produce new modes of encounter that begin to make felt how the work is open to a reorientation, too often in this context the conditions have not been created that would allow the work to really extend beyond it-self. The concept of the transindividual makes felt the limitations of this view. From the perspective of transindividuation, participation is always already there, active as the more-than at the heart of the event in its formation. Participation is not the way the outside adds itself to a process already under way, but the operational multiplicity of a practice in its unfolding. Participation is not what the artist wishes the public would do (I have certainly succumbed to this in my own practice), but the activity of the work’s potential as opened up by the process itself. Though this more-than, this participatory activity, is highlighted in participatory art, it is important to recall that all events are transindividual at their core, and by extension, all artistic processes are capable of mobilizing this transindividual share.
