Speculative pragmatism means taking the work’s affirmation, its urge of appetition, at face value, asking what thought-feeling does in this instance, and how it does it. It means inquiring into the modes of existence generated by the act of “hypothetical sympathy,” honoring the minor gestures produced at this interstice, and seeing what these open up, in a transversal maneuvering. It is about balancing several books, or several passages, or several ideas, or several textures, at the edge of the desk, on the floor of the studio, and wondering how else they might come together, and what else, together, they might do. It is about asking, as Russell does, “what it would
feel like to believe in his or her theories,” a task speculative at best, and taking this speculation to its pragmatic limit: what can it do to thought, to a thinking in action? This is immanent critique.
