The cueing to conditions of change cannot happen in the real-time where these shifts reach conscious perception. That would be too slow. The cues are moving you before you consciously realize the need to make a minor shift, to tend in a certain direction, to alter the quality of your movement. The nonconscious movement of thought moves you, a thinking in the field that cannot be separated from the moving, alerting you to the fact that you have moved only in the event of attention becoming conscious. It is only now, and barely so, since conscious and nonconscious perception are continuously realigning, that you realize you have made way for a change in the relational field. This choreographic impulse is distributed, the movement attuning to cues that are themselves shifting in the mobile ecology that is the subway platform.
