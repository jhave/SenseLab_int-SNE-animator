The irony is that the backlash against facilitated communication (the belief that the facilitator imposes their voice onto that of autistics) and the resulting insistence that autistics prove their ability to write “independently” seems to have been yet another way of segregating autistics from their potential. As Blackman argues, it isn’t facilitation that backgrounds her singular poetic voice, but precisely the focus on independence and its emphasis on “more typical language processing.” As she became more and more capable of writing beyond the register of facilitation, it seems that her language began to lose the rhythm and tonality of autie-type, the composing-with of autistic perception. For instead of deadening the liveliness of perception’s complexity, as language is wont to do, autie-type seems to be singularly capable of funneling it, carrying into language its prearticulations. This is not to say that the force of autie-type is completely absent in Blackman’s writing. It is simply to note that it is backgrounded in comparison to the poetic writings of autie-typers such as Tito Mukhopadhyay, DJ Savarese, Larry Bissonnette. Is it because in their case facilitation continues to be more present, either in the form of direct contact or in a more relational sense? Or is it because Blackman’s writing has been influenced by her academic experience? Either way, let there be no question: Lucy Blackman remains not only a poetic thinker, but also a poetic writer. Everywhere in her prose carrying the feeling moves thinking in the act, composingacross the complexity of how to articulate the unsayable in the said.
