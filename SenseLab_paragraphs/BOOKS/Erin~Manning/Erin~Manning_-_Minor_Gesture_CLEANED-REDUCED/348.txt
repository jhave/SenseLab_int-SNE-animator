With regard to the potential of agencement in the intervals of existencein-the-making, technique makes all the difference. This is why techniques are so central to the work done at the SenseLab, the laboratory for thought in motion where much of my thinking and making around choreographic thinking takes place. Here we ask ourselves what kinds of techniques would best create the conditions for the opening of a field of experience to a different way of functioning. If we are working toward creating an event, for instance, we will work to make sure that the eventâ€™s thresholds (the ways people initially enter the event) will be capable of creating emergent attunements. Previous to the event, in weekly SenseLab gatherings, we will invent movement exercises, for instance, that explore how a relational milieu opens itself to modes of encounter. We will then explore how the openings created might allow for a qualitatively different entry as regards ordinary habits of self-presentation.17 We also work to create techniques that open the event to its more-than human ecology. Usually we will spend a full year on these techniques with the hope that one or two will actually make a difference in the event.
