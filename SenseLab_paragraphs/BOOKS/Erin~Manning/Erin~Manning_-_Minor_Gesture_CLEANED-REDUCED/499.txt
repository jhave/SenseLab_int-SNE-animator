Citing Anne Donnellan, Ralph Savarese writes about the challenge autistics experience in “staging the customary relation of the senses and body parts, which must subtly cooperate to produce the seamless integrity of neurotypical functioning. The tricks that autistics employ to compensate—touching something to make sight useable, for example—reveal the necessary relation: there are no discrete faculties. As the drive to pattern links distinct entities through a process of visual or auditory comparison, the equivalent shows up in language through the practice of touch-based typing. Touch literally coordinates thought, and not just any kind of thought: rather, sensuous, relational thought” (Savarese 2012: 188). Language comes relationally and remains relational: the process of facilitated communication, as suggested in the last chapter, only emphasizes what is everywhere the case: to act is never to act alone. Facilitation takes many guises. For those whose body refuses to organize itself, it acts as an organizing force, it “coordinates thought, and not just any kind of thought: rather, sensuous, relational thought.” For there is nothing more frustrating, I’m certain, than when “ladle of doing language meaningfully is lost in the soup of disabled map of autism.” Facilitation opens this “disabled map of autism,” thanks to a “potholder of touch” (Bissonnette in Savarese 2012: 189). And in the mix of the thinking-feeling-become-writing, the poetic voice of autie-type emerges, caught, always, between petrification and the spark.
