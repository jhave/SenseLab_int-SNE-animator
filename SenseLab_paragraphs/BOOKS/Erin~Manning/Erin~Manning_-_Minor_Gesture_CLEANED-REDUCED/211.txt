The pearls are jewels in this sense: their value alive in the transduction they embolden. For they are mobile in their dynamism. Their decorative quality does not reduce them (as the art world often suggests as regards art that can be worn) but brings to them a mobility that can move them beyond the institution back into the everyday. As objects-in-variation, they open the field of contemporary art to its uneasy outside, to that uncertain interstice between art and craft, between what is displayed and what is worn, between what is seen and what is felt. The aura they carry over is subtle, an aura that would probably be neutralized should the beads simply be hung on the gallery wall in multiples, as contemporary art is wont to do. For these beads are for wearing, for moving, for giving, for becoming-with the multiplicity that is occasioned in the act of fashioning the body, fashioning the world. This fashioning is key to their variation-on-potential.
