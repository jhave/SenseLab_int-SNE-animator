There is often a presumption that volition and attention work together. In this kind of analysis, attention is seen as that which is consciously directed by the subject. But attention, as I’ve suggested elsewhere, is more distributed than it is situated.19 It emerges in the event, activated by the force of directionality the event calls forth. This dance of attention—where it is the field that attends and attention is less parsed than environmental—is alive in autistic perception. It is true to say that in the more neurotypically inflected experience, attention does land more easily, but even here it would be a misnomer to suggest that it lands on a predefined subject or object. Attention lands as a vector, activating the subjective form of the event, not a precategorized subject. Like the feeling of effort, attention is culled from
the event, its force a pull that organizes the event into the tendency it will follow. Moved by the directedness of the event’s force-of-form, attention dances toward the singular experience it has revealed.
