I outline this messy and nonlinear process of making a work work to suggest that many of us who are intuitive to artâ€™s problems are in fact engaged in the making of weather patterns and the activating of their minor gestures. For works that emerge out of an intuition that seeks to activate the art of time are works that trouble, complicate, nuance, embolden how experience is felt both for the human and beyond the human in the morethan human realm, the realm that connects to and composes with the human but is not limited to it. Such works, it seems to me, are especially strong when they take as their governing mandate the problematization of the interactive gesture itself, asking how it might be possible to make felt threshold transitions occasioned not only by the human participant, but by the wider environmental ecology, hence making the move from interaction to relation. How to make felt the relational field that is embodied in the shifting of light, the rhythm of tone, how to make felt the field effect of color? How to move the participant beyond volition to the experiential realm, both nonsensuous (alive in the fielding of involuntary memory) and sensuous (transducing into the now of event-time), where the conscious meets the nonconscious and new nonvoluntary, unpredictable, generative movements can be crafted?
