Fred Moten writes: I feel like I want to be part of another project. Which is to say I’m not acceding to the fact; it’s not like I’m just trying to turn my eye from it. I don’t want to accept in silence without protest all the different forms of inequality and exploitation that emerge as a function of the theft and of the failure to acknowledge the debt. . . . But I also know that what it is that is supposed to be repaired is irreparable. It can’t be repaired. The only thing we can do is tear this shit down completely and build something new.
