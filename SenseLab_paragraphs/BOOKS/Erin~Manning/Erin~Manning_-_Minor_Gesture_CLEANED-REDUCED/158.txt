Sympathy
Sympathy, for Bergson, is neither the benevolent act that follows the event nor the result of or a response to an already-determined action. Sympathy is the vector of intuition without which intuition would never be experienced as such. An event sympathetic to the force of its intuition becomes capable of generating minor gestures that open the process to its technicity. Sympathy is what allows the event to express its more-than. It is what opens the event to what intuition has called forth: “We call intuition that sympathy by which we are transported to the interior of an object to coincide with what it has that is unique, and, consequently, inexpressible” (Lapoujade 2008: 11).
