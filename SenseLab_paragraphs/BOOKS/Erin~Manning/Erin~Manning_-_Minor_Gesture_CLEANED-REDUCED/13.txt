In its movement, the minor gesture creates sites of dissonance, staging disturbances that open experience to new modes of expression. In making felt the event’s limit, the operational interval where the event exceeds the sum of its parts, the minor gesture punctually reorients experience. The event here is defined according to a Whiteheadian concept of the actual occasion. Actual occasions are the coming-into-being of indeterminacy where potentiality passes into realization (Whitehead 1978: 29). When speaking of the event’s potentiality, I am lingering on the side of the asyet-undetermined share of the actual occasion. I am focusing on the phase of realization of the event, of experience, where it has not yet fully become this or that. The minor gesture is active in this indeterminate phase of the event. This is not to underestimate the necessity of an event’s coming to form. As Alfred North Whitehead emphasizes, it is the event’s atomicity, its capacity to be fully what it is, that ultimately opens the way for the potential of what is to come: without atomicity, in an arena of pure becoming, there would be no “elbow room in the universe,” no opening for the disjunctions through which difference is produced (1967: 195). The emphasis here is not on the continuity of becoming, an infinitely open account of process, but on the becoming of continuity: process punctuated. The event and the minor gesture are always in co-composition, the minor gesture punctuating process, moving the welling event in new and divergent directions that alter the orientation of where the event might otherwise have settled.
