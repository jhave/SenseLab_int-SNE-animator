Bifo sees the current landscape of depression as “a product of the ‘panic’ induced by the sensory overload of digital capitalism, a condition of withdrawal, a disinvestment of energy from the competitive and narcissistic structures of the enterprise. And it’s also a result of the loss of political composition and antagonism” (Genosko and Thoburn in Berardi 2011: 8). Depression is the collective effect of a social tendency, as “born out of the dispersion of the community’s immediacy. . . . When the proliferating power is lost, the social becomes the place of depression” (Berardi 2008: 13). In the past, autonomous and desiring politics were actively co-composing, whereas now, in neoliberal times, such proliferating power is lost, and the act—activism—is incapable of resurrecting it. It’s difficult not to see Nietzsche’s last men rearing their heads in this dark account that has so completely lost the élan of the in-act. “The earth has become small, and on it hops the Last Man, who makes everything small. His species is ineradicable as the flea; the Last Man lives longest” (1954: 5). This is certainly not Bifo’s hope, nor is it what moves his writing, but I wonder whether the account of depression he proposes doesn’t end up cementing a reactive nihilism, a cynicism that tends, despite its position “against,” to strengthen the status quo. Being out of act, out of service—isn’t that the very posture of ressentiment?
