Schizoanalysis is a practice that reorients itself continuously around the intuition of a problem, in the Bergsonian sense. Its mantra is “What can a body do?” “We cannot, we must not attempt to describe the schizophrenic object without relating it to the process of production” (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 6). Always linked to desire (also in the mode of production), schizoanalysis taps into the force of a bodying that shapes experience into its exuberant potential, exuberant not in its attachment to a subject, but exuberant in its chaosmosis, in the force of its expression across the precarious chasm of petrification and spark. A productive, material intervention emerges that takes the site of expression as exemplary of what it does, not what it fantasizes. The goal is not to locate the symptom. What happens, as Whitehead might say, happens, and it is how its effects resonate that makes the difference. Speculative pragmatism. Not what you think you see, but how the seeing materializes, and what it does. So you don’t perceive chairs? Sit on the ground instead. The face doesn’t form? Follow the light effects.
