Technique and technicity coexist. Where technique is defined by the repetitive practices that tune a process, technicity is a set of enabling conditions that exact from technique the potential for the process to exceed its form. Where technique paves the way for a degree of complexity within a given field of experience, technicity opens the event to its agencement. Activated by the minor gesture that bridges technique and its more-than, technicity moves the process toward a practice still to be defined. This is the potential we sometimes see in that one dancer in the corps de ballet who stands out even though the form of her movements doesnâ€™t necessarily depart from those of the dancers around her. What makes this one dancer stand out is the quality not of the form of her movements themselves but of the what else within her movement-moving, the tenor, the intensity, the color of what the form leaves behind. Think technicity as the agencement that stretches out from technique, creating brief interludes for the more-than of technique, gathering from the implicit the force of form. Think technicity as the art of the event.
