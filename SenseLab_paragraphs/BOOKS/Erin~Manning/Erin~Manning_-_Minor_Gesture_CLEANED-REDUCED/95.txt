Whitehead’s process philosophy never privileges the human realm. Experience is experience; different kinds of experience have different effects. When exploring what an occasion of experience can do, appetition is a productive place to begin, for it reminds us that the urge is part of the process: the urge has an effect on where the event can take us. Whitehead sees reason both as the appetition that creates the initial opening onto the process, and as the decision that cuts into it to align it in a certain direction toward specific ends. Where mentality can open a process to anarchy, revealing the open-endedness of its proposition, appetition of a second order can lend the process a sense of organization. This is not the same kind of organization as method. It doesn’t seek to deny the anarchic share of the process—it mutually includes it (1929: 33). This mutual inclusion is felt as the carrying-over into experience of the beneath of words, the pulling-in of the ineffable more-than. This tunes the occasion to its differential, foregrounding contrast, the force of form that always resonates on the edges of the gesture toward the ordering we call categories. The function of reason is not to judge the categories, but to effect a canalization that can momentarily contain the anarchy. Reason as appetition allows the occasion to become self-regulatory, inducing “a higher appetition which discriminates among its own anarchic productions” (1929: 34). The mutual inclusion of the anarchic share tunes the event away from mere life toward life's morethan.
