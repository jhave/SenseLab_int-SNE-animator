A memory of the future makes felt the smallest vibrational intervals— human and nonhuman—that lurk at the interstices of experience. Paired with the minor gesture, which assists in making these intervals take expression, a memory of the future intuits them, activating their force of becoming by opening them to the untimeliness of their current rhythms. This is intuition: the captivation, in the event, of the welling forces that activate the dephasing of experience into its more-than. A memory of the future because this more-than cannot quite be captured, cannot be held in the presentness of experience. The memory of the future is an attunement, in the event, to futurity not as succession but as rhythm: the future pulses in experience in-forming. The memory of the future is the recursive experience, in the event, of what is on its way. Déjà-felt.
Bergson calls the mechanism by which this future-feeling arises sympathy—sympathy not “of ” the human but with experience in the making. “We call intuition that sympathy by which we are transported to the interior of an object to coincide with what it has that is unique and, consequently, inexpressible” (Lapoujade 2010: 53). Sympathy as the motor of excavation allows the movement to be felt, opens experience to the complexities of its own unfolding.
