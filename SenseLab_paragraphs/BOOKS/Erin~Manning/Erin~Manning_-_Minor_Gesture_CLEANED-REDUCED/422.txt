Dancing, I experience this often. Take an example from Argentine tango. The relational movement at the core of an improvisational salon tango practice depends on preacceleration, the virtual force of a movementmoving before it is consciously felt as such.18 This feeling is shared. If I am leading a movement and I want the other dancer to follow, the movement in its incipiency must be felt in advance of its becoming an actual displacement, for it is into this incipiency that her movement will move. The incipiency cues the movement-moving. What I am leading is not a form, but a force, a tendency, and it is to this tendency that her movement must tune. This tendency is enveloped in a terminus, but a terminus to a large degree activated in the relation. When it happens, as it often does, that a second tendency “distracts” me, my partner will move into the tendency I didn’t think I led. She will move into the movement-moving of a deviation-onterminus. In response to the follower moving to tendency, the leader must reorient, often facilitating an orientation neither could have predicted in advance. This is relational movement at its best.
