Technique is necessary to the art of thought—to thought in the act— but it is not art in itself. Elsewhere, I have proposed that technicity may be one way to talk about what art can do in its outdoing of technique.9 Technicity would be the experience of how the work opens itself to its potential, to its more-than. This quality of the more-than that is technicity is ineffable—it can be felt, but it is difficult to articulate in language.
Since it works, as radical empiricism does, in the complex field of conjunctions opened up by the transitions in experience, research-creation can make technicity palpable across registers. It can make felt the force of transition and dissonance active in the conjunction. James writes: “Against [the] rationalistic tendency to treat experience as chopped up into discontinuous static objects, radical empiricism protests. It insists on taking conjunctions at their ‘face-value,’ just as they come. Consider, for example, such conjunctions as ‘and,’ ‘with,’ ‘near,’ ‘plus,’ ‘towards.’ While we live in such conjunctions our state is one of transition in the most literal sense” (1996: 236).
Transition doesn’t mean pure unconstrained becoming. It means flow and cut, discontinuity and difference. Transition is the swerve of experience through which continuity expresses itself. Continuity becomes; it is not becoming that continues. Emphasizing the cut of process, James reminds us that process grows from discontinuity: “One more will continue, another more will arrest or deflect the direction, in which our experience is moving even now. We cannot, it is true, name our different living ‘ands’ or ‘withs’ except by naming the different terms towards which they are moving us, but we live their specifications and differences before those terms explicitly arrive” (1996: 238).
