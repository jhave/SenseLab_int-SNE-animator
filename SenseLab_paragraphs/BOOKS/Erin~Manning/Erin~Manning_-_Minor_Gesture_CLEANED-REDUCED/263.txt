In this regard, her fashionings actively produce what Deleuze calls “a belief in the world” (1989: 172). Like the world-constituting procedure, a belief in the world refuses to follow the world as given. A belief in the world is about crafting the conditions to encounter the world differently each time. Procedural architecture takes this as its mantra. To become procedural, a practice has to directly connect to habit’s mutation and, from there, create not new habits, but new incipient directionalities. These incipient directionalities will have the tendency, over time, to morph into habit. A procedural architecture must therefore be capable of activating minor gestures that continuously direct incipiency toward new modes of existence. Much tweaking is necessary to find the right balance between the static and the chaotic.
