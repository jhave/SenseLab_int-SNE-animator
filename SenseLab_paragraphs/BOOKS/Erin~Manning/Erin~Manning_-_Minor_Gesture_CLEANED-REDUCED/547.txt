Affirmation does not yet know what the field can do, and so it neither predicts nor (de)values it in advance of its coming to be. Affirmation does not position: it experiments. It is pragmatic in its speculation. Speculative pragmatism is experimental to its core, asking at every stage how the cut makes a difference. Speculative pragmatism does not comply with the existing parameters of experience. It does not stand outside them to judge. Speculative pragmatism, in the name of affirmation, invents, doing its work at the limit where what if? becomes what else?
