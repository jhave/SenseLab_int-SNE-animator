This kind of facilitation, seen as the creation of a relational field for experience in the making, is quite common in the everyday. Think of the university classroom, of the ways in which pedagogical tools are used to activate discussion, to pull thinking out from the group, to generate new movements of thought. This collective act is understood to be a key part of education, and yet the facilitation needed by many autistics is still too often understood as interfering with what is considered the “natural” independence key to learning, as though thinking-with or composing-with were not at the very heart of experience. This is not the only irony, as Blackman rightly points out: where the neurotypical is assumed to be inherently relational in terms of intersubjectivity, the autistic is far too often still wrongly considered to be incapable of relation. This makes the critique of facilitation particularly paradoxical: “It is . . . funny . . . that the principal objection—but I have to say not the only objection—to hands-on support is the possibility of influence, and the likely feeling of close emotional connection, both of which are typically [regarded as] deficits in autistic relationships!” (2013: 39).
