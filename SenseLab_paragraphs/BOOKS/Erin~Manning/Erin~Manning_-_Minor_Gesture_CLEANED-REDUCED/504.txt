Schizoanalysis, as Guattari emphasizes in an interview after the publication of Anti-Oedipus, “introduces into analytic research a dimension of finitude, of singularity, of existential delimitation, of precariousness in relation to time and values” (in Genosko 1996: 136). Unlike psychoanalysis, it does not seek to “discover” the unconscious, but asks it instead to “produce its own lines of singularity, its own cartography, in fact, its own existence” (1996: 137). And it does so not through the individual, but through the prepersonal force of the group-subject, a collectivity through which experience becomes multiple. To bring to it the language of autistic perception is to emphasize how the schizoanalytic process foregrounds the becoming-multiple, in an emergent ecology, of the shape of enthusiasm. Not this body, this experience, this identity, but a collective field-effect of relationscapes that map themselves out according to emergent cartographies that exceed this or that subject or object. Experience makes itself felt as multiple, and it is out of this multiplicity that an account of its effects can be expressed. Like the conversation with the pigs, where the force of the oinking exceeds one person’s voice, or even one person’s idea of what constitutes a conversation, the becoming-multiple of experience through the group-subject allows a fractured, complex, and expressive field of enunciation to emerge. This field resists interpretation: it cannot be explained away. In Guattari’s words: “The term ‘collective’ should be understood here in the sense of a multiplicity that develops beyond the individual, on the side of the socius, as well as on this side (so to speak) of the person, that is, on the side of pre-verbal intensities that arise more from a logic of the affects than from a well-circumscribed, comprehensive logic” (in Genosko 1996: 196).
