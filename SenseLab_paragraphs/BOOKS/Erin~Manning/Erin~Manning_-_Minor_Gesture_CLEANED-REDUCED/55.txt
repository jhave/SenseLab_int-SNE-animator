Throughout, I consider movement as decisional rather than volitional, decision defined here not as external to the event but as the cut, in the event, through which new ecologies, new fields of relation are crafted. The soccer player’s reorienting of the field was decisional in just this way. Nonconscious movement is decisional in the sense that it is capable of altering the course of the event in the event. Elsewhere, I’ve called the attunement, in the event, toward decisional movement, choreographic thinking, emphasizing the ability of movement to cue and align in spacetimes of composition in ways that open experience to new registers.23 Reflective consciousness actually gets in the way of this process, as dancers and athletes will attest to. Movement-moving is at its most creative, its most operational, when not curtailed by the imposition of narratives of volition and intentionality.
