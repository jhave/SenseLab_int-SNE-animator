In a neurotypical accounting of experience, there is a tendency to organize feeling-forms into articulations that parse experience into manageable bits. But something else is always also at stake in the operations of expression. Carrying is a conduit in all experience: it is what underlies the mobility of all perception. The main difference between the autistic and the neurotypically inclined is not the modality of perception as such but how perception is fielded. In the neurotypical, because the fielding is more direct in the sense that parsing happens more quickly, the feeling of the subjective-formâ€™s inherent multiplicity is not as foregrounded. This is what allows the neurotypical to be so certain that experience begins with them, in the body, in the human. If we view subjectivity from the perspective of autistic perception, on the other hand, the heterogeneity of feeling makes it more palpable that subjectivity is in the making, in the field. Subjectivity is not felt as predetermining: it is connected to the field of experience as it in-forms it.
