The manner of experience is felt qualitatively in its event-time. This qualitative expression of experience in the making is not “objective.” There is no perfect standpoint from which to explore it, and its effects are immeasurable. Event-time is in movement, lived, felt. How it connects to what will come to be is how it becomes what it is. In this sense, it is intuitive. The manner created in the practice of artmaking is intuitive chiefly in its way of taking and making time. The art of time is elasticity—not object, not genre, not form, not content. This is not to say that these aspects of artistic practice cannot coincide with part of its process. It is to say that the eventness that is the art of time is before all else an elastic opening onto the qualitative difference intuition activates. The manner of art’s making creates robust effects that nonetheless are capable of generating infinite intuitive openings for art’s more-than.
