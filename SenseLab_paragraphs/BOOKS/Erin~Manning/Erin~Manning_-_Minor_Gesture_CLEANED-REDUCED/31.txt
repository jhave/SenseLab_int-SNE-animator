Critique tends to lead the way. Learning is a fragile enterprise that can too easily be sidetracked by the encroachment of what is set up, in advance, as relevant or irrelevant. In the name of critique, this fragility is often framed and deadened through the crafting of questions that already have answers, or whose answers are close at hand, contained within preexisting academic discourse. “The critical academic questions the university, questions the state, questions art, politics, culture. But in the undercommons it is ‘no questions asked’” (Moten and Harney 2013: 38). The mode of critique that operates as an academic trope stifles the very opening through which fragile new modes of existence can come to expression. What if knowledge were not assumed to have a form already? What if we didn’t yet know what needed to be taught, let alone questioned?
