This is the key detail Bifo’s analysis of Guattari’s winter years misses: that all of Guattari’s theory and practice emerges from the necessity to bring out the collective resonance of the event, to see illness not as a personal problem to be analyzed outside of the field of relation, but as an event, an ecology, that necessitates the kind of minor gestures that populate the ritual described above, minor gestures that tune the event to its more-than. As outlined so comprehensively in Anti-Oedipus, the force of schizoanalysis is that it creates the conditions for opening the event to its productive schism rather than reducing it, as psychoanalysis would do, to a regressive account of a preconstituted past. Time, in schizoanalysis, is of the event, in the group-subject of its co-composition. Any technique created in the name of schizoanalysis needs to be able to craft event-time, to move the event to an operative more-than that persuasively cleaves it with the instauration Souriau argues is at the heart of the creation of new modes of existence.
