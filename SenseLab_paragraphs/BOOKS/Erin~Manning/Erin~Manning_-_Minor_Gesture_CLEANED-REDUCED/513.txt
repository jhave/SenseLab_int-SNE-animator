To push experience to its schizoid pole is to take seriously the way in which modes of existence are multiple, uncountable in their potential expressivity. Where the shape of enthusiasm is most palpable, this multiplicity is often decried as “too much,” “too noisy,” “too uncontained,” as though a return to the solitary individual will provide solace. Certainly, it helps to have access to motor skills that can dependably find the right letter on the keyboard, but surely this is not enough to convince us that multiplicity is a travesty. And yet this is what we say every time we bemoan the fate of autistics, or when we speak disparagingly about the complexity of neurologies that evade the comfortable center where existence tends to be most valued.
