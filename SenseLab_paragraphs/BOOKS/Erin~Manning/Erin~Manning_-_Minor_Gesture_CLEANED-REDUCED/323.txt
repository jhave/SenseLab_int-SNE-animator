The extraction from the field of total movement initiated by the point of inflection results in a co-composition—virtual and actual movement compose to create the durational movement-field experienced in the moving. This calls for a complex relational attunement, in the event. Speeds and slownesses and scales of action must attune as the field changes in nature. If the shift in scale or speed is acute, the attunement in its difference is felt as the what else of the movement’s coming into itself, as I described in the last chapter. This occurs thousands of times a day, though it is rarely noticed consciously.
