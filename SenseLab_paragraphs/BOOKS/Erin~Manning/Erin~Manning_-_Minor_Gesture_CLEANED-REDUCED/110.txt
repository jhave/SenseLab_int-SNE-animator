Technique touches on how a process reveals itself as such. Dance technique involves the honing of repetitive movements, but it also encourages the experimentation of what else those movements can do. Painting involves techniques for mixing color, for composition and form, but it also generates techniques of exhibition invested in mobile reorientations of what painting can do. This is not method: it is more dynamic than method, open to the shift caused by repetition, engaged by the ways in which bodies change, environments are modulated and modulating, and ecologies are composed. The painter-paint-canvas ecology is an ever-changing one, from sitting to standing to looking to feeling to touching to seeing. The writer-keyboard-book ecology also inventively alters its technique from the necessity to get another cup of tea to the rereading of the passage that gets things going to the habit of starting with a citation, to the terror and excitement of the writing itself.
