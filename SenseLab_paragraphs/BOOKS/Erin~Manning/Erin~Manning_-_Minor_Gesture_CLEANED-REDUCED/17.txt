I define this framing of existence as neurotypical not to underestimate other forms of oppression, including racism, classism, sexism. My hope is to underscore the mutual indebtedness of the narrative of neurotypicality and the framing of certain bodies and certain forms of life as less worthy. Take blackness. Neurotypicality, Fred Moten suggests, is another name for antiblackness.10 The neurotypical stages the encounter with life in such a way as to exclude what cannot fit within its order, and blackness, or what Moten describes as “black sociality,” always ultimately exceeds capture.
In a videotaped conversation entitled “Do Black Lives Matter” between himself and Robin D. G. Kelley, Moten speaks of the concept of black sociality in the context of the 2014 murders of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. He explains: We need to understand what the state is defending itself from and I think that in this respect, the particular instances of Michael Brown’s murder and Eric Garner’s murder are worth paying some attention to.
