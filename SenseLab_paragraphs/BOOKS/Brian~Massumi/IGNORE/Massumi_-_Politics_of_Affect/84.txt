doesn’t just force us down certain paths, it puts the paths in us, so by the time we learn to follow its con- straints we’re following ourselves. The effects of power on us are our identity. That’s what Michel Foucault taught us. If power just came at us from outside, if it was just an extrinsic relation, it would be simple. You’d just run away. In the 1960s and 1970s that’s how a lot of people looked at it – including myself. Drop out, stop following the predictable, straight-and-narrow path, and things like sexism will just disappear. Well, they didn’t. It’s a lot more complicated than that. Power comes up into us from the field of potential. It ‘in-forms’ us, it’s intrinsic to our formation, it’s part of our emer- gence as identified individuals, and it emerges with us
– we actualize it, as it in-forms us. So in a way it’s as potentializing as what we call freedom, only what it potentializes is limited to a number of predictable paths. It’s the calculable part of affect, the most probable next steps and eventual outcomes. As Foucault says, power is productive, and it produces not so much repressions as regularities. Which brings us to the ‘society of control’ and to capitalism. . .
