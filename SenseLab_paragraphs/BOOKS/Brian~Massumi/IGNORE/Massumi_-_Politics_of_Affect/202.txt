There’s a certain incompleteness to any micropolitical event, like the SenseLab events I was talking about. A lot of things participants feel were on the verge of taking shape didn’t quite happen. Potentials that you could just glimpse didn’t come into focus. The goal is not to over- come the incompleteness. It’s to make it compelling. Compelling enough that you are moved to do it again, differently, bringing  out  another  set  of  potentials, some more formed and focused, others that were clearly expressed before now backgrounded. That creates a small, moveable environment of potential. The goal is to live in that moveable environment of potential. If you manage to, you will avoid the paralysis of hopelessness. Neither hope nor hopelessness – a pragmatics of poten- tial. You have to live it at every level. In the way you relate to your partner, and even your cat. The way you teach a class if you’re a professor. The way you create and present your art if you’re an artist. If you participate in more punctual events like the ones I was describing, this will provide a continuous background for what comes of those events to disseminate into and diffuse through. A symbiosis of the special event and the day- to-day, in creative connivance.
This is not to say that operating in a more macro, top-down, manner is wrong or should not be under- taken. It’s just to say that if it’s done to the exclusion of micropolitical activity it’s mortifying, even when it’s done for survival’s sake. Sometimes there is no alterna- tive but to centrally impose certain enabling constraints. For example, I’d be very happy if the transition to a renewable-energy future or a global redistribution of wealth or a non-growth paradigm were imposed on the capitalist system. But high-level solutions of that kind
