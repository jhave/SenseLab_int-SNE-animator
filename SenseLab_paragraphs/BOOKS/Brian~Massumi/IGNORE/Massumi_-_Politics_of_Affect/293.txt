of potential interest. The tweets disappear after their predetermined shelf life of two weeks. The Facebook links settle into the search engines, and can stay forever, like sediment from the event. Then there were the news aggregators that automatically sent the article out in all directions and embedded it in other sites, basically at random, and without any particular limit to how far afield it could go or long it would stay where it landed, enacting an ethos of trawling and grasping and appro- priation endemic to the economy of internet content providers. So what was the media event of this little article? What was its relational field? It was  all  of those timelines, with their different modes of prolifera- tion and differential attunements, embodying different ethoses of engagement. Even something as small as that tiny contribution to the internet far outpaced my per- sonal ability to follow what became of it, and to under- stand how it was playing, because it was just too splayed out and proliferating. It was a weird feeling of instantly losing control over a product of your personal time investments and of the desire for them to yield a graspa- ble result commensurate with your input, and on the same human scale. I was in that little event, I was in the splay, being pulled in all directions. I really didn’t feel it as an experience I was having. It was like being drawn and quartered by an experience that had a life of its own and a time of its own – or multiple times – and that I was just the launch pad for it.
