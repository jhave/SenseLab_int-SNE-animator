Brian Massumi: I just don’t think that the possibility of a common language exists any more, if it ever did. And if it did, I wouldn’t want it. I don’t think I’d be alone. That in itself uncommons it. It would have to be imposed. It would necessitate an exercise of power-over, very different from empowerment, the power-to of ontopower. I wouldn’t  want  it  because  in  my  way of thinking it would be anaesthetic. It would be de-intensifying. It would flatten affect by standardizing response. It would put politics back on the uncreative road to reflex. Consensus is always the product of a power-over. It is an habituation to it, even if it’s a soft form of it. I can’t imagine a ‘common language’ that is not consensus building in a de-intensifying way.
The world is too complex to hold to that as a model. The fragmentation of nations into sub-communities, the accompanying increase in the number of nation-states formed from these communities, the destructuring effects of movements of capital, the way these unchained capital flows enable or force a constant movement of people, goods, ideas and information across borders – all of this has created a hyper-complex situation of flow and variation over which there’s no effective oversight. There’s no vantage point from which you could encom- pass it all, there’s no shared perspective from which to find a common language or build a consensus or share a rationality. The situation is constitutively dissensual.
