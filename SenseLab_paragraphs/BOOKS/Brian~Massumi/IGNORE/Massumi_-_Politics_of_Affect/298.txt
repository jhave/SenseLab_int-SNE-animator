Bodil Marie Stavning Thomsen: It’s a situation that calls for a new affective politics. Perhaps it could be thought of in relation to what Marcel Mauss said about the structure of the gift. The gift is some way of attunement to another person or community, but it carries this pos- sibility of iteration – you always have to re-give the gift in some sense. It’s hard to say, but perhaps the media are actually enhancing that. The gift is in a way becom- ing bigger and bigger, but also becoming poisonous in some sense. So returning to this idea of eco-biological diagramming, in relation to affect, there’s something to be done here. Something that has to do with value pro- duction. In a normal gift economy, everyone is acutely aware that it’s a sharing, but that has been lost somehow, or blurred. You never know when the sharing stops or when it begins.
