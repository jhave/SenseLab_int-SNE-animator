adaptation, as neo-Darwinians do. In fact, it calls all normative thinking into question, suggesting a need to think much more about the supernormal – about what creatively exceeds the typical and refuses to be limited by resemblance to past forms.
As I mentioned earlier, Whitehead defines the con- formity   or   conformation   between   past   events   and present events as the physical pole of nature. You have to think in terms of the co-functioning, or co-operation, of two tendencies. On the one hand, you have a ten- dency of the present to extend into the future in con- formity  with  what  happened  in  the  past.  This  is  a tendency towards homeostasis, towards a discharge of intensity or a return to equilibrium. On the other hand, you have an equally strong tendency towards the super- normal,  towards  intensive  deformation  exceeding  the givenness of instinctive schemas and their adaptation to the environment – towards the invention of forms. This is the aspect of activity that Whitehead defines as mental. The important point for me is that you cannot think the two tendencies separately. It is not an alternative. The mental and the physical are not opposites, they are co-operants. They are two dimensions of the same oper- ation. Two poles of activity. Their co-operation is event-
ful. It comes in episodes.
It makes no sense to define mentality or the physical outside of events. They have to be thought of as con- trasting dimensions or modes of activity that co-occur within every event. If you look at it that way, it’s no longer a question of the mind or the subject. You can’t contain the activity of mentality in a noun. Nor can you talk about the body as a substantial thing. You can’t reduce it to substance. You are talking about a mental
