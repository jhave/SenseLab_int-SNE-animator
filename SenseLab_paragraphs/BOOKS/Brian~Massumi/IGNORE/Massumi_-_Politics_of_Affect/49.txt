Brian Massumi: Well, an emotion is a very partial expression of affect. It only draws on a limited selection of memories and only activates certain reflexes or ten- dencies, for example. No one emotional state can encompass all the depth and breadth of our experienc- ing of experiencing – all the ways our experience redou- bles itself. The same thing could be said for conscious thought. So when we feel a particular emotion or think a particular thought, where have all the other memories, habits, tendencies gone that might have come at the point? And where have the bodily capacities for affect- ing and being affected that they’re inseparable from gone? There’s no way they can all be actually expressed at any given point. But they’re not totally absent either, because a different selection of them is sure to come up at the next step. They’re still there, but virtually – in potential. Affect  as  a  whole,  then,  is  the  virtual co-presence of potentials.
This is  the  second way  that  affect has  to  do with intensity. There’s like a population or swarm of poten- tial ways of affecting or being affected that follows along as we move through life. We always have a vague sense that they’re there. That vague sense of potential, we call it our ‘freedom’, and defend it fiercely. But no matter how certainly we know that the potential is there, it always seems just out of reach, or maybe around the next bend. Because it isn’t actually there – only virtually. But maybe if we can take little, practical, experimental, strategic measures to expand our emo- tional register, or limber up our thinking, we can access
