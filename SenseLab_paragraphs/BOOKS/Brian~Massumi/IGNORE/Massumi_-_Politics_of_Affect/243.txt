of structuration. They may not amplify past the point of incipiency, they may be captured, or simply fail to take and subside back into the field of bare activity from which they came, but still their difference cannot not have been felt at some level, in some way. So even if there is no unsullied state of freedom to return to, there is always a degree of freedom offering the potential for other emergences. There are always counter-tendencies that can be joined, and moved with, proposing them- selves for amplification. There is always a margin of manoeuvre. What a body can do is tweak the field â€“ improvise modulations of the field of activity in a way that takes up the offer of these different-order affective tendencies. What a body can do is trigger counter- amplifications and counter-crystallizations that defy capture by existing structures, streaming them into a continuing collective movement of escape. If the move- ment effects an intensification of the collective field through the mutual inclusion in it of reciprocally height- ened capacities in contrastive attunement, then the degree of freedom has been increased across the board. Powers of existence have been collectively augmented. This can only occur from within, in situation, flush with the event, in an immediacy of enaction.
In this enactive immediacy, resistance is of the nature of a gesture. Resistance cannot be communicated or inculcated. It can only be gestured. The gesture is a call to attunement. It is an invitation to mutual inclusion in a collective movement. The only power it has is exem- plary. It cannot impose itself. It can only catch on. Its power is to throw out the lure of its own amplification. Its power is of contagion. The gesture of resistance is a micro-gesture of offered contagion, oriented otherwise
