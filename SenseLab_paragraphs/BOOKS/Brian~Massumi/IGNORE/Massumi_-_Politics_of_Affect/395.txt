normally encountered in nature, then varying the char- acteristics of the decoys to see what factors were neces- sary to prompt a response. He found that there were no elements that could not vary, and that the most ‘natural’ forms actually prompted less ‘passionate’ results from the animals. Tinbergen himself speaks in terms of the passionateness of  the responses.  The  most passionate responses were to deformations affecting more than one perceptual factor at the same time – in other words to changes in the relational field of experience. Not all relational-field deformations were equally impassioning. The ones the animals reacted to the most strongly were ones that intensified the perceptual qualities of the field
for example by heightening contrast. Even after figur- ing that out, Tinbergen still couldn’t predict the response. It was being improvised. It was in some way spontane- ous. Tinbergen  did not really  know what to  do with that, because it didn’t fit his theoretical framework. He just threw up his hands and said, it’s forever a mystery. But we can draw the conclusion that there is a tendency towards deformation that runs in the direction of increased experiential intensity. This tendency is inher- ent to instinct itself, so that it is in the nature of instinct to create variations on its own operation, from a spon- taneity of experience. Instinct is creative by nature.
What Tinbergen found, even though he didn’t want to acknowledge it, was that at the heart of instinct there is a force of invention. This means that creativity is innate. It is in our nature. You could even say that we are most in touch with our animality, with what is most singular in animal life, when we surpass the given in a creative way. This fundamentally calls into question the tendency of theorists to define animal life in terms of
