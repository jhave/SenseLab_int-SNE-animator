resist, and where power effects accumulate. This places power structures and their corresponding roles on the level of effect, or of what comes to be eventfully deter- mined. Power can no longer be construed as resting on an ideological ground that is predetermining. So the first step towards mobilizing a theory of affect for resistance is to understand that there is a first degree of resistance in any encounter that it is not simply passive, but already expresses a capacity, and that it is these encounters that are determining. There is no ideology as determining, in the first or last instance. Power structures are second- ary effects of affective encounters, and ideologies are secondary expressions of power structures. Ideology is on the side of effects â€“ twice over. It is not fundamen- tally on the side of causes. What it is certainly not is a sufficient cause.
The complexity of this model of affect quickly com- pounds. There is a second part to the definition. Affect, Spinoza says, is the capacity to affect or be affected, as applied to a transition. Further, the transition is felt, as the passing of a threshold to a higher or lower power of existence, understood as an affective readiness for subsequent encounter. That readiness carries resistance to the extent that it is unsubordinated to the roles une- qually assigned by already-established power structures. It is with the notion of affect as involving a felt transi- tion that we move, as you indicated in your question, away from the paradigm of rationality, while preserving thought. In the heat of an encounter, we are immersed in eventful working-out of affective capacities. We have no luxury of a distance from the event from which we can observe and reflect upon it. But in that immediacy of   feeling   absorbed   in   the   encounter,   we   already
