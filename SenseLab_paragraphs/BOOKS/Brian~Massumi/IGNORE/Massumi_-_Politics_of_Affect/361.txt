Brian Massumi: I want to take up the notion of solitude you brought up in relation to anxiety in Simondon’s work. I think that’s really important too because when he talks about group-subjectivity or collective individu- ation, and the importance of entering into certain event- based actions in a relational field including others, people often think of it as this imperative of together- ness, to social transparency, and total availability to that interaction. I think what Simondon is trying to say with his concept of solitude is that if there is an imperative of that kind, it can be as limiting and painful as the anxiety of mistaking the preindividual for a subjective interiority. When he talks about isolation he is talking about an experience  of  transindividual  potential,  but in the absence of any particular acting-out of it.  It’s being in-acted; that is, felt actively, but in intensity. Deleuze says something very similar, and he is probably thinking of Simondon, when he says that even one person alone at their writing desk can be a collective. They can be in-acting a field of relational potential that would require a whole population to act out. They are in a very real sense a ‘people to come’. Deleuze even suggests that this is where one is at one’s most collective. The incitation to always communicate, the imperative to participate, the constant solicitation to interact can
