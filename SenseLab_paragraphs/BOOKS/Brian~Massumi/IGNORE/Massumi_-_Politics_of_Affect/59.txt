Brian Massumi: Yes, I think you could say that sensa- tion is the registering of affect that I referred to before
the passing awareness of being at a threshold – and that affect is thinking, bodily – consciously but vaguely, in the sense that is not yet a fully formed thought. It’s a movement of thought, or a thinking movement. There are certain logical categories, like abduction, that could be used to describe this.
