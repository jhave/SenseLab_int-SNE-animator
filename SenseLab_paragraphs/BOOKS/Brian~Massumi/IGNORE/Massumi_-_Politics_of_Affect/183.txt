present is the drop of experience that is one with that unfolding. It is the feeling of the resolution of the tension, as the event plays itself out, for the process to then start all over again. If thought is the effective pres- ence of what is not actually present, a terminus is an element of thought. Then multiple  termini  together are an intensification of thought. The specious present feels this intensity of  thinking pass into action.  Nor- mally the intensity itself is overshadowed by the effec- tiveness of the action it passes into. Whitehead defines the aesthetic in terms of this intensity of contrasts. An aesthetic act brings this contrastive intensity out from under the shadow of action’s instrumentality or func- tional aim. It brings the contrastive intensity of active potential into the specious present as such, to stand alone, with no other value than itself. The aesthetic act extends the creative tension of contrast that character- izes the emergence of every action. It prolongs the sus- pension of the cut, the commotion of interference and resonance, gives it duration, so that it passes the thresh- old of perceptibility and is consciously felt as potential. This prevents the terminus from being an  automatic feed forward to the end, like a reflex response to a stimulus. Resolution is suspended. The termini in play remain virtual ends. Their mutual exclusivity is still informing the situation, contributing to what it might be, but the tension doesn’t have to resolve itself to be consciously felt and thought. Aesthetic politics is irreso- lute. It’s the thinking-feeling of the virtual incompletion of definitive action.
