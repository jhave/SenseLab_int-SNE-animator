array of experience in which the human is one among many. Or, more precisely, where there is no ‘easy’ category, such as ‘human’, to begin with. This second approach, which we are here linking to immediation, requires a different kind of work because it does not lay out, yet, the stakes of the emergent collectivity. For me the question of ‘how it comes into formation’ is really the political question, which is not to disparage an account that comes  from  another  perspective, which would be a historical account of already emerged political formations, for instance. I just don’t think that the force of the political in its potential for change occurs at that level.
