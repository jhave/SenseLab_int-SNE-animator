takes time, it takes a willingness to risk one’s ideas, a sense of openness, and it takes an event or project. This cannot be done in the abstract. In the case of coming together with Madeline Gins, it was done in the context of bringing our two worlds together through the ‘Enter Bioscleave’ event. The reason the event is key is that it is through the event that the techniques will be experi- mented with, and it is in the event that we will be able to see how our convergences of approach resonate. How the procedures unfold, what the techniques for relation do, will be key to seeing whether they are gen- erative of emergent collectivity or whether they need to be tweaked towards future experimentation. And how they will be tweaked will then have an effect on how we determine the stakes of the event, which will of course be different for each of us. For Arakawa and Gins, the stakes are ‘reversible destiny’, which involves an account of immortality which we follow only to the extent that we are invested in emergent collectivities that go on living across their perishings, in lines of vari- ation. Again the stakes connect but they are not the same. They don’t connect in a commonality – they connect in the urgency of a procedural approach, in the urgency of a project.
