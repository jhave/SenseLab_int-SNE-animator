The definition considers ‘to be affected’ a capacity. The force of a blow, for example, is a product of an imping- ing force meeting a force of resistance, a certain capacity to resist. That capacity is a mode of activity of the body. It is a doing, as much as the blow itself (it is the body asserting its structural integrity, bracing itself in a certain manner to absorb, deflect, dodge the blow, or even, as in martial arts, to turn its force back against its author). Reciprocally, the fist that delivers the blow does not just affect its target. It is also affected by the force of resist- ance it encounters. To hit can hurt almost as much as to be hit. But the shared pain corresponds to a distribu- tion of roles. The distribution of roles attaches the mode and degree of activity. The outcome may give one party a certain advantage in a next encounter. The relative standing of the parties involved may change in a way that has lasting effects. If those lasting effects stabilize into an inequality between the parties that conditions subsequent encounters, the structuring of an emergent power structure has occurred.
A blow is what it does. What it does is trigger the eventful resolution of a differential of forces at a point of encounter. The Spinozist definition hinges affect on encounter. It is thoroughly eventful, it derives structure from event. The two sides between which the encounter passes cannot simply be characterized as passive or active. The affective event does not presuppose a pas- sivity on one side and an activity on the other. It involves a differential of modes and degrees of activity that is eventfully resolved, to structuring effect. This is very much in keeping with Michel Foucault’s definition of power as a complex differential of forces, where the power to affect is strictly coincident with the power to
