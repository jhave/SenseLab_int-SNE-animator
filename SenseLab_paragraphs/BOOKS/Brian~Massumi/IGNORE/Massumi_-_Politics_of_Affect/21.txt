definition of affect with which the first interview begins. Once  they  introduce  themselves,  they  wend  their way through subsequent interviews, taking on greater conceptual consistency, complexifying the concept of affect as they go. This is what a process-oriented explo- ration does: complexify its conceptual web as it advances. It tries not to reduce. It tries not to encapsu- late. It does not end in an overview.

My years of involvement in the SenseLab have inestimably enriched my thinking, and my life. The encounters and relations I have experienced
