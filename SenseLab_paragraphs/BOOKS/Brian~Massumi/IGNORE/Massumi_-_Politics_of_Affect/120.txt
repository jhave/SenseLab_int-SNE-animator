power it did in Seattle. The anti-globalization move- ment had already lost that power by the time it reached Genoa (2001), when people started to die. The violence was overused by certain elements of the movement and under-strategized – it got predictable, it became a refrain, it lost its power.
The crucial political question for me is whether there are ways of practising a politics that takes stock of the affective way power operates now, but doesn’t rely on violence and the hardening of divisions along identity lines that it usually brings. I’m not exactly sure what that kind of politics would look like, but it would still be performative, and it would resist personi- fication in peak individuals. In some basic way it would be an aesthetic politics, because its aim would be to expand the range of affective potential – which is what aesthetic practice has always been about. It’s also the way I talked about ethics earlier. Félix Guattari liked to hyphenate the two – towards an ‘ethico-aesthetic politics’.
