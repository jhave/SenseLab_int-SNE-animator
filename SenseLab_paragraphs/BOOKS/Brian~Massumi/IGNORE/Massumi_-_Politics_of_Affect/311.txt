Guattari’s point is that not moving over into a new field, not enabling or effecting a tip-over, is basically a collec- tive decision involving affective evaluations that have to do with purely qualitative, integrally relational values. Those evaluations are not necessarily wholly conscious, or available for reflective judgement. In fact, it is certain that they are not, because of the points we’ve been making throughout this interview about how movement in a relational field by nature overspills the individual and its actuality. That is why affective politics are so necessary, and why they have to be directly collective. The challenge is how to practise an affective politics that is capable of addressing the nonconscious dynamics, that occurs on an affective level of immediation, and how to do that without becoming coercive. It’s in response to that problem that at the SenseLab we have been exploring concepts like technique of relation, gift, tweaking and modulation, conviviality, processual proposition, and lure. And we’re doing this within the wider perspective of anti-capitalist struggles. The mar- ginalist logic of the limit, as reconceptualized by Deleuze and Guattari, applies just as much to the capitalist economy as to a tribal economy. For example, effec- tively addressing underemployment and exploitation, or addressing the ecologically disastrous capitalist impera- tive of endless growth, or truly addressing the innate tendency within a capitalist economy for inequalities to grow, and grow more and more intractable, could well lead towards threshold states. What does an anti- capitalist affective politics look like that moves the global relational field in other directions? All I can say is that to improvise that kind of politics we have to take seriously the qualitative-relational workings of the field
