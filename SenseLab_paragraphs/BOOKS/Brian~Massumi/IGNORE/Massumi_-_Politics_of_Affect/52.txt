Brian Massumi: I wouldn’t tend to say it’s primal, if that means more ‘natural’. I don’t think affective inten- sity is any more natural than the ability to stand back and reflect on something, or the ability to pin something down in language. But I guess that it might be con- sidered primal in the sense that it is direct. You don’t need a concept of ‘mediation’ to talk about it. In cul- tural theory, people often talk as if the body and its situatedness on the one hand, and our  emotions, thoughts and the language we use for them on  the other, are totally different realities, as if there has to be something to come between them  and  put  them into  touch  with  each  other.   Theories   of   ideology are designed for this. Mediation, in whatever guise it appears, is the way a lot of theorists try to overcome the old Cartesian duality between mind and body, but it actually leaves it in place and just tries to build a bridge between them. But if you define affect the way we just did, then obviously it includes very elaborated functions like language. There’s an affect associated with every functioning of the body, from moving your foot to take a step to moving your lips to make words. Affect is simply a body movement looked at from the point of view of its potential – its capacity to come to be, or better, to come to do. It has to do with modes of activity, and what manner of capacities they carry forward.

If it’s direct, it’s in the sense that it’s directly in transition – in the body passing out of the present moment and the situa- tion  it’s  in,  towards  the  next  one.  But  it’s  also  the
