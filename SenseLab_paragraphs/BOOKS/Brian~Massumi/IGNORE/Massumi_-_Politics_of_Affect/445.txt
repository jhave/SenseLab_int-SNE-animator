between different events, which are always in some way singular). And from the complexity of the feed- back between nonconscious and conscious dimen- sions of experience, new tendencies arise. These constitute enactive speculations on the future poten- tial of activity. Affect theory does not reduce the mind to the body in the narrow, physical sense. It asserts that bodies think as they feel, on a level with their movements. This takes thinking out of the interiority of a psychological subject and puts it directly in the world: in the co-motion of relational encounter. If the Humean definition of the mental is accepted – as that which exceeds the given – then every bodily event is flush with mentality. Every act has a degree of mental- ity proportionate to its capacity to surprise. That capacity varies across the nature–culture continuum, but is never entirely absent, even in the supposedly mechanical workings of ‘dumb’ matter (as determin- istic chaos theory has amply demonstrated). Affect requires a far-reaching re-evaluation of what a body can do. What is normally called the ‘mind’ is a reduc- tion of the body’s capacities to the sphere of reflective consciousness (which, as neuropsychology has amply demonstrated, is always accompanied by incipient, sub-threshold actions ‘mirroring’ what is being thought; this was known in process philosophy and affect theory long before the discovery of mirror neurons, under such names as ‘re-enaction’, ‘incipient action’ and ‘reactivation’). Concepts like ‘thinking- feeling’, ‘non-sensuous perception’, ‘nonconscious experience’ and ‘bare activity’ are designed to deal with the complexity of the body in this processually extended sense. They are ways of articulating how
