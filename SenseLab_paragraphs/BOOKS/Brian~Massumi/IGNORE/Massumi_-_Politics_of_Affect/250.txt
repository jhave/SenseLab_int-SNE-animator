think new distinctions are necessary, not only among structure, system and process, but also between bio- power and ontopower (which for me actually goes even beyond biopower in its becoming-immanent to the field of life – a point of disagreement with Lazzarato), and concerning the relation of state (and state-like) structures to capitalism (for the state is one of the last refuges of supposedly rationalized structure – capitalism hardly bothers to assert its rationality any more, contenting itself with creating the affective ‘fact’ of its inevitability).
In any case, it’s an ongoing project. We are in the midst – as always – and things will only begin to become clear as we continue to experiment collectively and par- ticipatorily, on the conceptual level in our writing and thinking, and afield experimentally, in thinking-feeling gestures of invitation to collective movement, on the street and in the institutions framing our daily activities. Like the field of resistance, the clarification is to come, flush with our exemplary events. To be invented . . . If faith in affect is misplaced, as Deleuze often said, ‘belief in the world’ is not. It’s all we have: the participatory trust that the world always already offers degrees of freedom ready for amplification.
