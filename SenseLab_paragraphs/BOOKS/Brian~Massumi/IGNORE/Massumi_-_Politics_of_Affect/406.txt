input. What we often like to separate out as physical as opposed to mental or subjective always criss-cross, they always envelop each other – they are always complexly mutually including.
When I was talking about going beyond the logic of the excluded middle towards a logic of mutual inclu- sion, I was referring to this intertwinement: the included middle, the criss-crossing between mentality and physi- cality that is a requisite factor  in  the  ontogenesis  of live effects.
The logic of this mutual inclusion is neither the logic of the disjunctive plurality, nor the logic of the dynamic unity that is its virtual expression. It’s the logic of their inter-involvement. It has to do with what Bergson calls pure multiplicities, as different from plurality, or diver- sity in the sense of a set of countable elements. Bergson says that there are phenomena consisting in a continual turnover of qualitative changes that actively interpene- trate, that include each other in process. You can’t sepa- rate them out, and you cannot count them,  because there are zones of overlap, zones of indistinction where they are absorbed in each other, and because the turn- over is so quick that there is never a moment where you could point to a separate figure as a unity, in the way the Kanizsa triangle stood out as a unitary figure.
He says that these qualitative multiplicities of change are tendencies, an idea I find extremely useful. He says that tendencies do not relate to each other in the way that objects relate to each other. Objects are rivals. They cannot be in the same place, they mutually exclude each other. Tendencies,  on  the  other  hand,  may  clash,  but even as they clash, they can participate in each other – as in the way we say that love and hate do. Tendencies
