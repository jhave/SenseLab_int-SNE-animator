practices to counter urban violence, but they are also often overwhelmed by the magnitude of the task. Anxiety and depression often come with burn-out. In the face of such adversity, it is difficult to sustain the field of relation generated by activist event practices, and prevent it from imploding under pressure. Tech- niques for avoiding or alleviating the implosion of course concern the individual, but they cannot be limited to him or her.
One thing we experiment with is the question of reconnecting affectively to the collective in a different way, getting away from thinking about ‘being active’ in the sense of ‘doing something’ and focusing instead on the in-act of ‘something doing’. This brings us back to the earlier question of affect: what does it mean to co-compose? To co-compose is to allow for the possibil- ity that we cannot know in advance where the collective value of our project resides. It means to become flexible in our understanding collectively of how value might eventually come to be understood. A collectivity in the way I understand it is always concerned with these speculatively pragmatic questions – speculative because they remain open to invention, pragmatic because they are born of a continual exploration of the in-act. At the SenseLab, one of the ways we move towards this ques- tion of collective value is through the concept of event- based care. Here I don’t mean the subjectivity of human-to-human care, but rather how an event pro- duces an environment that can sustain different kinds of participation which include different affective speeds, including the slownesses that we perhaps associate with depression, or the speeds we associate with anxiety. With event-care perhaps there is a kind of collective
