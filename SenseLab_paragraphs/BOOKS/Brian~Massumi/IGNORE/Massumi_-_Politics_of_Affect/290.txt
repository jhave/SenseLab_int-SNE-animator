When you say that we are in the affect rather than affect being in us, it reminds me of Deleuze who says that we’re in time, time is not in us. We have both of those experiences, both in it from both angles at the same time. What is interesting about new media experi- ence is that it somehow returns to this experience, and frames it and makes it compelling as duration – or non-duration.
