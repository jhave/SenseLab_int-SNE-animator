The point of the talk yesterday was that you cannot separate out the logic of pluralities from the logic of unities, because unities are emergent from pluralities. They supervene as events of relation occurring across the separation between the givenness of diverse ele- ments. Something happens between the circles with the angles cut out. The triangle emerges to fill the distance between them. It appears as an expression of their sepa- ration, as well as an expression of its own virtual reality as the figure we see without actually seeing â€“ as its own unitary, non-decomposable, immediate and unrefusable pop-out effect.2
