in those terms. Faith in affect would be as misguided as faith in supposedly disinterested reason. For me, the question is two-fold. On the one hand, it is purely prag- matic; on the other, it is in a certain way aesthetic. Pragmatically, the question concerns powers of exist- ence – powers to act, think and feel. Can strategies privileging an affective approach to events increase our powers of existence? Can they help us act differently, think more actively and feel more thinkingly? If the answer is yes – and I think it is – then they are intensi- fiers of existence, and produce what I just called a surplus-value of life. A surplus-value of life is a surplus- value of experience: an enactively lived and immediately felt qualitative difference expressing a heightening of capacities. It is a felt excess of potential, over and above any particular state of being. That could stand quite well as a definition of aesthetic value. Affective approaches embody a pragmatist aesthetics of life’s living.
The question of servitude is actually complicated by this perspective. There is nothing essentially liberatory or progressive about affect. Deleuze and Guattari were haunted by the problem of what they called ‘microfas- cism’. That is the idea that oppressive structures (like the state) can only bear down from above because they have first risen up from below. They are crystallizations of tendencies that have amplified and settled into a self- reproducing structure. Power structures are structura- tions of affective tendencies. They are emergent, and like all emergences, their seat is the seat of affect – what I call ‘bare activity’, or the activated thinking-feeling body in its radical openness to events and to other bodies, in affective attunement. Structures of oppression not  only  have  their  seat  in  bare  activity,  they  must
