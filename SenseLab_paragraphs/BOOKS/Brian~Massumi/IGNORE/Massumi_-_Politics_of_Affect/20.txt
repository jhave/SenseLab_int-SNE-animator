‘transversal’, in Deleuze and Guattari’s understanding of that term. This means that it cuts across the usual categories. Prime among these are the categories of the subjective and the objective. Although affect is all about intensities of feeling, the feeling process cannot be char- acterized as exclusively subjective or objective: the encounters through which it passes strike the body as immediately as they stir the mind. It involves subjective qualities as directly as the objects provoking them, or with which they move. It concerns desire as much as what is imperatively given; freedom as much as con- straint. Thinking the transversality of affect  requires that we fundamentally rethink all of these categories in ways that include them in the event, together. It requires honing concepts for the mutual inclusion in the event of elements usually separated out from it,  and  from each other. A simple mix and match of received catego- ries is not enough. An integral reforging is necessary. This is complicated by the fact that although affect’s openness is unconfinable in the interiority of a subject, to take one of the concepts in need of restaging, it is at the same time formative of subjects. Although affect fundamentally concerns relations in encounter, it is at the same time positively productive of the individuali- ties in relation. In its transversality, affect is strangely polyvalent.
Much of the work of the book is dedicated to laying the polyvalent groundwork for this reforging of con- cepts, transversal to their usual diametric opposition with each other. Such fellow-travelling concepts as ‘differential affective attunement’, ‘collective individua- tion’, ‘micropolitics’, ‘thinking-feeling’, ‘bare activity’, ‘ontopower’  and  ‘immanent  critique’  relay  the  base
