Brian Massumi: Yes, we’re in affect, affect is not in us. It’s not a subjective content of our human lives. It’s the felt quality of a relational field that is always ‘more- than’, as Erin emphasizes in her writing – always more- than one, to cite one of her book titles,5 and always more-than human. Going back to the question of tech- nique, the techniques have to be techniques of imma- nence – welling up from within that more-than of ourselves. It can’t be otherwise, because you’re in a situation of uncertainty, you don’t have an overview, there’s no position of mastery, there’s  a  complexity and diversity in the field that you can’t possibly com- prehend completely, and you’re changing with it. Because of this, the approach has to be heuristic and experimental, taking off from very partial points of entry where a tweaking might potentially amplify or resonate throughout the field. But you never know for sure. So you have to remain attuned, you have to keep attuned to how the field is affecting you, even as you are affecting it. So it’s a kind of double becoming, where you as an individual are being modulated by the collec- tive field, as much as the field is being modulated by your gestures. You’re never standing outside just direct- ing or judging or critiquing or commenting upon or describing. You’re adventuring. You’re taking risks, not so much in the sense of putting others at risk – although that could happen, which makes all of this directly a question of ethics – but more fundamentally taking risks with who you think and feel you are and what you can become.
