tending that comes close to the sense that  Guattari gave to the word ‘therapeutic’. Not therapeutic as indi- vidual therapy, but therapeutic in the sense of attending to how an event is capable of producing mutually imbri- cated modes of existence or modes of living which are sustainable in ways we can’t yet imagine, and which produce new forms of life. I say this very tentatively as I am not at all certain that therapeutic is the right word for this.
