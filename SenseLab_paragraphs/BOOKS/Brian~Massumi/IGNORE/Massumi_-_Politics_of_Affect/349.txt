the habit of how we believe we can control it! The habit of entering into a process brings with it the promise that a process engaging with the same conditions twice can generate an event that looks like the event that it gener- ated the first time. But what Brian is saying is that if you take this process seriously, and attend to how it evolves in each of its phases, you will find that no event can be mapped in advance. The event takes us with it and the outcome is always experienced in retrospect: ah! that’s what it was! But instead of saying ‘that’s what it was!’ we have the habit of taking the past and impos- ing it on the future, quietly exclaiming ‘that’s what it will be!’ Immediation tries to challenge that habit.
What we have found in our collective SenseLab network as we work through the relationship between philosophy, art and activism is that techniques have to be generated in the event, each occasion anew, because if they are not, they simply don’t work. That’s the prag- matic side or as we call it the speculative pragmatic side. The event generates its own forms of speculation and forms of pragmatism, and you have to be in the event to compose with them. This is a relational task at the level of the field itself. If you think of yourself as the subject of the event, you’ll fail simply because you will have taken yourself out of all of those complex rela- tional tendencies of the event to generate its own poten- tial. What is at stake here is understanding not the agency of the subject, but the agencement of the event in its speculatively pragmatic unfolding. This is a word that is impossible to translate. The best that anyone’s come up with is ‘assemblage’, but that’s misleading. Agencement connotes a doing doing itself. You have to understand the event itself as agency-ing.
