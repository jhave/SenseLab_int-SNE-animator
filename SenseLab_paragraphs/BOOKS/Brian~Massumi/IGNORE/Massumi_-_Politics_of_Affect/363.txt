Erin Manning: In relation to the question of collective action, in the way we understand it at the SenseLab, we have been very influenced by Guattari’s accounts of La Borde, the experimental clinic he worked at all of his life, and the ways in which it may be possible to compose across many different variations of solitude and anxiety
