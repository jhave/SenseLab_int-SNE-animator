principles. It immanently enacts its own principle, which is one with its exemplary movement. There is no ought to resistance. On what basis can we say that it is better to desire one’s freedom than one’s servitude? That one ‘ought’ to resist? An ‘ought’ is nothing but an already assumed servitude to a higher order of imperative. To say ‘ought’ is to enact our servitude to abstract princi- ple, and to justify our imposing it on others, as from outside and above. It’s a power move. As such, it carries seeds of domination – perhaps a new order of domina- tion, but domination nonetheless. Freedom, like oppres- sion, is desired, or it is nothing at all. It cannot be ‘oughted’ and imposed. It cannot be inculcated. It is desired, or it is nothing. Resistance is the counter-desire for the collective augmentation of powers of existence, in dynamic mutual inclusion in an intensive field of contrasts. There is no basis on which we can say it is ‘better’ in principle. But there are ways to perform its desirability – to make it more desired, more strongly tended towards, more amplificatory and exemplary. There are indeed techniques of resistance. They are tech- niques of relation aimed at immanent field-modulation. They are gestures already in relation, in participatory immersion, stirring towards self-augmenting relational movement.
This is closer to the anarchist notion of ‘propaganda by the deed’ than it is to traditional Marxist notions of ideology critique and vanguard action. Over the last two years, we have seen this kind of exemplary politics percolating up in many places around the world. The Occupy movement’s refusal to advance a particular set of demands is a case in point. This refusal to set forth a programme was not a deficiency, it was an
