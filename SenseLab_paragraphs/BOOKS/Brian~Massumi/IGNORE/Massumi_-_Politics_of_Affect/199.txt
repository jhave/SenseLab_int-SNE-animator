A lot of the thinking about what we’re calling tech- niques of relation has been done before in social move- ments, particularly starting in the 1960s, and in artistic movements. We have a sense that it is something that people all over the world are again feeling a hunger for, and taking up again on their own, in their own home bases, in different ways, sometimes consciously in con- nection with movements like the anti-globalization movement, sometimes within the smaller confines of their own institution, with a view to making it more liveable and sustaining. There is a lot of thought and experimentation going on, many techniques that have already been invented, many more on the way. We see ourselves as connecting to that wider movement, creat- ing one more forum for that kind of activity. It’s not something we feel we’ve invented or in any way own. It’s in continuity with a discontinuous tradition – a set of practices and orientations that rise and subside, but always seem to rearise, because the hunger is always there, the need to revivify habituated, reflex-tending forms of life, and to do it collectively. We look forward to the connections between different approaches to par- ticipatory art-philosophy-political event design growing more dense and networked and expanded.
