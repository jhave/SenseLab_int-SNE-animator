talk about this in The Power at the End of the Economy. Decision is always a collaborative undertaking, between you and situational factors – including nonhuman ones like bulls and mud. The decision involves both poles, the mental and the physical, defined as we were talking about earlier. And by those definitions, the mentality and physicality involved do not parse out along the traditional lines. All the mentality is not in you. If men- tality is the mode of activity whereby what eventuates surpasses the given, then the potentials in your encoun- ter with the field are ‘mental’. The bull and the mud and the gate of the bull pen participate in the mentality of the situation as much as your subjective states do. William James succinctly expresses this distributive nature of mentality when he poses the question of con- sciousness by asking not ‘what does it mean for me to be conscious of a pen?’ but rather ‘what is it to be con- scious in a pen?’ He was referring to his writing instru- ment, but in relation to this example it works just as well with the other definition of a pen.
