account is not to say that we should think about affect instead of language, or pay attention only to the infra- subjective and infra-objective germinal stirrings of events that Erin was just talking about and forget about subjects or objects. It’s just not an either-or. It’s a ques- tion of differing modes of activities that factor into events. The concept of affect, as taken up in a philoso- phy of immediation, is a way of focusing on the germi- nal modes of activity that factor into events as they are just beginning, and are not yet fully determined as to where they might lead. It’s a directly relational concept, because you have to think the ‘to affect’ and ‘to be affected’ as two sides of the same coin of the event. Affect is a point of entry into an eventful, relational field of complexity that is already active, and still open- ended. The point of thinking with affect is to think through our implication in relational fields, and the potential we might find there. There is no general model of affect. The way the past carries over into the new event, which tendencies are  reactivated, in what  mix and with what formative interactions, all of that is completely singular to the situation, so the theory of affect has to be custom tailored to every field of event- formation, and even to every event. It has to be continu- ally reinvented.
