In  my  talk  last  night  here  at  Tanzquartier  Wien I was talking about the virtual as a kind of emergence. I talked about a very  simple  optical  illusion  called the Kanizsa triangle, where there are  three  corners that are black circles, but there is an angle cut out of each, so that together they suggest the corners of a triangle. You see a triangle, even though the lines of the triangle are not actually there. I was talking about how  the  disjunctive  plurality  of  discrete   elements that are separated from each other with no actual con- nection between them creates the conditions for an appearance that I call a pop-out effect. This is an emer- gence effect. It comes unrefusably, proposing itself to vision. It’s an immediate, unrefusable vision of some- thing which is not actually there, but which  defines what the situation is all about for our perception. It makes the situation be about how we cannot not see what isn’t actually there – a real, virtual triangle, or what I call a ‘semblance’ in Semblance and Event. The triangle is virtual in the sense that there are no actual lines connecting the corners. It is virtual, and yet it appears. The triangle, although virtual, is  real,  if  by real we mean what has the power  to  insist  on  its own presence, which we have to accept regardless: we cannot not see it. The reality of this virtual triangle makes the situation about how the invisible, or more generally the imperceptible, may come to characterize an event. Even though this effect is predictable and repeats, given the condition, there is still a newness to it, because that emergence of the shimmering triangle that we see without seeing it is in a way fresh every time. There is something surprising about its insistence on appearing.
