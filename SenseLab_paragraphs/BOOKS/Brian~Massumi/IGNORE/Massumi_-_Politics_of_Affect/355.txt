attached to Heidegger’s being-towards-death, and to Sartre’s prescription for absolute subjective freedom of decision in the face of anxiety. He’s trying to save our anxieties from either fate. For Simondon, anxiety has to do with the ‘more than oneness’ at the heart of the individual. This is basically the active, relational field of potential we’ve been talking about – what Erin’s been calling the more-than. Simondon calls it the ‘preindi- vidual field’ because it is what the individualized subject emerges, and re-emerges, from. Anxiety is created, according to Simondon, when this open-ended, forma- tive field is mistaken for an interiority of the subject, rather than being recognized as the preindividual field from which the individual emerges as a subject. When the preindividual is mistaken for an interiority, the resulting subject feels that it should be able to hold all the potential of the field in itself. This is impossible, because as we were saying, the potential is irreducibly relational, and can only be held integrally in situations. It can’t be accessed just by individual choice or decision, but only by events, in which others are also implicated. The imperative that the individual is often made to feel to live up to its own potential, mistaking the world’s potential for a being-in-itself, creates an unliveable tension. It actually bottles the potential up. The other, in this account, is not the hell of our choices and decisions being limited by others, as it was for existen- tialism. The other is the  outlet.  The  potential  of the preindividual field is relational, and can only be expressed relationally, through and with others. In fact, Simondon defines the other in terms of that. He says that the perception of another is the perception of a perspective on the world. By that he doesn’t mean a
