So, every time you cross a threshold as you make your way through life, you are moving into one presupposi- tionalfieldafteranother. Eachisactuallyaco-involvement or co-implication of a set of potential qualitative changes

When you transition from one situation to another, what you move into is a mutual inclusion of alternative potentiali- ties presenting themselves integrally, as a singular rela- tional milieu. This happens before you know it – or as you know it, abductively. Active participation precedes conscious perception.

You are drafted into the situation, and are already to some extent constrained by the lay of the participatory land in which you find yourself. You are constrained in the sense that the active potentials enveloped in the rela- tional milieu are conditioned by the situation. But there are always degrees of freedom – precisely because what presents itself is a landscape of alternative potentials, and not a fait accompli. It’s not over until it’s over. There are any number of things that could happen, by your own actions, or the bull’s, or by chance, that might modulate the field’s complexion of potential, altering its presuppositions on the fly.
