emergence of an extra-being of the individuals involved
– a more-than-individual expression of their coming- together to shape a relational milieu that belongs  to them collectively. The ‘more-than-individual’ is a term from Gilbert Simondon.

The approach I’ve been describing suggests another concept of value. You can call a ‘value’ anything that character- izes a situation – anything that sums up the singular character of the event in which the constituent differen- tials, tensions and tendency of the situation culminate.

That mode of vitality has value, or is a value, because it sums up a coming-together of tendencies in an emergent figure. The process of that coming-together  towards that emergence will add itself to the world as another available tendency. Once a value, always a value, in
