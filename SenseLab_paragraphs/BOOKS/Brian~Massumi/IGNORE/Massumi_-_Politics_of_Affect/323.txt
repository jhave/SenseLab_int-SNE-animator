Relationscapes.11 We can learn, I think, from the complex modalities at work beyond narrative struc- tures, even in a case like Riefenstahl where the explicit politics is so odious to us. In Riefenstahl, as in Folman, what appears are ‘biograms’ – forces for bodies in the making – what I call ‘bodyings’. The biograms them- selves are not inflected with an extrinsically assigned value. Their value is intrinsic to their operation. It is their force to make felt how bodyings are propagated. In the case of both  these  film  makers,  the  bodyings are always speciations in the sense we were talking about before – ecologies of expression that drive becom- ing, rather than structures of identity. In the Riefenstahl example, I’ve argued that the biogram in her films tends towards kinds of fascist becomings that are more crea- tive – and in a way more dangerous – than the ones we associate overall with Hitlerism. They are more danger- ous, because far less disciplinary, as Foucault might say. In the Folman example a different kind of bodying is at work which also has certain fascist tendencies (as all micropolitics do). But at the same time, it proposes a different way of ‘facing’ the question of the human share in existence. What I take away from both of these examples is that politics is not generalizable – that the event (be it in a film or in collective action) creates its own stakes, its own limits and potential tipping points. We must continuously be alert to these stakes and engage with the limits. Ari Folman takes an important risk, I feel, in staging the encounter in such complex terms without pre-defining the friend and the enemy.
