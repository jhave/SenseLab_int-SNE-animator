creativity. There are very strong pressures in this direc- tion in Canada and elsewhere, where art has become ‘research’ (‘research-creation’ is what we call it in Canada), subject like all academic activity to productiv- ity assessment. We wanted to see how far we could go, within the art and academic institutions, towards freeing creative and collaborative process from this tendency, while still continuing to survive within that environ- ment, which for better or for worse is the one that feeds us – we can’t deny our participation in it and our dependence on it – and which is overall is not going to change any time soon.
A lot of the impetus for what we’re  doing  came from some very intense conversations we had with Isa- belle Stengers, who explained that her criteria for a successful intellectual event was precisely that – that it be an event. That something really happens that wouldn’t have happened otherwise. If heaven, accord- ing to an old Talking Heads song,  is  where  nothing ever happens, then the conference is surely academic heaven. When was the last time you had a truly new thought at a conference? When was the last time that you saw an opinion changed by an academic discussion or debate? On the art side, the equivalent heavens are the artist’s talk and the standard gallery exhibition. Isabelle also emphasized that it is not a question of ‘freedom’, in the sense of simply lifting constraints. Nothing happens most where there are no constraints, because then anything goes, and anything going is just nothing carried to a higher power, heaven to the nth degree. You might avoid the conference, but where does that get you if you end up with the kind of free-floating, free-associating discussion you might enjoy late at night
