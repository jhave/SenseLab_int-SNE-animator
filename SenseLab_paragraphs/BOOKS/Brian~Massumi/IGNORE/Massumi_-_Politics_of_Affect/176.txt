Brian Massumi: Yes, that’s definitely part of the poten- tial process. It’s a way of acquiring new propensities, which if they become embedded in our everyday life are habits. As they repeat themselves, we become  aware that they function, even if we are not aware of them as they function. That secondary awareness easily wears out. Habits are ways of not attending-to, while still acting according-to. Their  nonconscious  functioning is self-repeating, an iterative process that can end up becoming a caricature of itself. A habit can habituate to itself. By that I meant that it can end up not attending to the newness or difference in the situations triggering it. When this happens, it has a tendency to make the coming event conform to past events. It loses its powers of adaptation, its power to renew itself, becoming  a mere reflex.
The opposite can also happen. Habit can rebecome a creative force for the acquisition of new propensities, because it makes capacities available for  enaction, and something can vary in the course of that making- available, and then be  added  to  a  body’s  repertory. To mobilize habit in this rebecoming way, the body, as you say, has to become sensitive to what’s coming. It has to feel the priming, as a formative force, before it bears fruit. Perversely, this is a kind of pre-emptive power. It is a pre-emptive power that is creative of a moreness to life, what I call an ontopower. I say it’s perverse because I am convinced that it is the same power mobilized by the contemporary military machine. In some of the most affect- and perception-savvy recent texts in military theory, they call this rebecoming- creative of habit ‘non-recognition-based priming’ and ‘sampling  the  future’.  It’s  part  of  a  colonization  of
