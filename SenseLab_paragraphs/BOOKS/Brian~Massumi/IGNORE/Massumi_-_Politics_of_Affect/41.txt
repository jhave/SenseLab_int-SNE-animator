many regions, with the global effects of environmental deterioration already being felt, with conflicts among nations and peoples apparently only getting more in- tractable, leading to mass displacements of  workers and refugees . . . It seems such a mess that it can be para- lysing. If hope is the opposite of pessimism, then there’s precious little to be had. On the other hand, if hope is separated from concepts of optimism and pessimism, from a wishful projection of success or even some kind of a rational calculation of outcomes, then I think it starts to be interesting – because it places it in the present.
