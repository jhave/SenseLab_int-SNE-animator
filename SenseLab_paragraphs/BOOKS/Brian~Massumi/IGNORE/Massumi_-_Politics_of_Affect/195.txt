located between the Montreal universities, in an urban space where Montreal’s different language communities intermix, and where academics, university-based artists and community-based independent artists can come together. We tried to think of how to create events that would bring people together, not on a blank slate, not even on even ground, but rather from a creative bias, from the angle of what most moved them, what moved their work, what made it  work.  The  first  thing  we did was to forbid anyone from bringing completed work.

We started thinking in terms of hospitality. That became our model. How do we create enabling
