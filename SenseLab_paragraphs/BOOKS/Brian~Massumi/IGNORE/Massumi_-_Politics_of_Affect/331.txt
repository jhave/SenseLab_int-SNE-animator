Brian Massumi: Immediation does not exclude determi- nations from the past or tendings towards the future. The term ‘immediation’ is a way of drawing attention to the event as the primary unit of the real. The idea is that whatever is real makes itself felt in some way, and whatever makes itself felt has done so as part of an event. It has entered in some way into the immediacy of the moment as a factor in the event now  taking place. This means, paradoxically, that whatever of the past is going to count in this event has to presentify itself. The first stage of an event of experience, accord- ing to Whitehead, is one of re-enaction, which I often call ‘reactivation’. Whitehead makes it very clear that this inaugural phase of presentification is affective. It’s a direct, unmediated feeling of what past events have left in the world for the coming event to take up as its own potential. This cannot be consciously discriminated as yet, because the event is just beginning and hasn’t sorted out what it will become yet. It can only be felt. But since the feeling is of potential, it can already be construed as a kind of thinking forward. It’s a thinking- feeling in the immediacy of what’s coming. Immediacy, in this way of thinking about it, is always in relation to the past, but it’s  a  direct,  unmediated  relation  to the past as the past is coming back to life in the singu- larity of a given situation that hasn’t yet fully played itself out. There is no general reference to the past. There’s a  singular inclusion of  the past in oncoming activity.   Immediation   is   actually   more   intensively
