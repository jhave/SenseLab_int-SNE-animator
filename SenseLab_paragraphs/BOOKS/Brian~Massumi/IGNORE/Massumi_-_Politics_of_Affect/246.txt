It was a way of saying that what was important was the gathering together of bodies and capacities in self-improvising collective movement for the production of surplus-value of life, and that democ- racy is that far-from-equilibrium movement – not its pre-programmed end in a prefigured stable structure. This is the ‘direct’, relational democracy of enactive resistance.

We began by discussing capitalism, and have ended up talking about structures  of  domination  that are tacitly on the model of the state. Everything I have just said about microfascism and structures of domina- tion has to be thoroughly reconceptualized in relation to capitalism. This is because capitalism, as I was saying at the beginning of this interview, is not a structure in any usual sense of the term. It is much too protean and fluidly self-organizing to be a structure. It is often called a ‘system’. But even this is perhaps too static a concept. Capitalism is an open system, coextensive with society. It is so dynamically self-modulating that it is best to call it a ‘process’, in contradistinction both to ‘structure’ and to ‘system’.
