is a kind of microshock that forces us to re-establish focus, re-jig our potential actions, refresh our relational field – re-chunk. We’re constantly re-generating experi- ence out of these interruptions, big and small. We’re a correlated population of intervals. As Erin says in her book Always More Than One, every experience we have starts anew from what she calls the autistic field of experience, or what I call the relational field in Sem- blance and Event. Her point is that all of us are on the continuum, we’re all on the spectrum, but some of us, those whom the autistics call neurotypical, chunk so habitually that they forget the relational emergence of experience.
