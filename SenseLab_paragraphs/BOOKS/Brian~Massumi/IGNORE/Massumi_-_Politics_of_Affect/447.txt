by past linguistic expressions, through the complex feedback loops between nonconscious and conscious levels already described. And they in turn in-form linguistic expression with abductive thinking-feelings of the potential towards which speech acts may spec- ulatively gesture, in their powerfully abstract  way. The infra-linguistic register of experience in-forms language’s capacity to modulate the mental pole of events. It primes and stokes language’s singular ability to exceed the given (its power to fabulate). As with all of the dichotomies that figure in this list of missed affective conceptions, the relation between language and the nonlinguistic must be understood in terms of a graded continuum of potentials punctuated by thresholds past which the mode of activity expressing itself changes qualitatively in nature. Rather than oppositions, affect works with qualitative differen- tials: the integral mutual inclusion of qualitatively different potentials for expression on the same spec- trum. It is always a question of degree. A pre-verbal human is already infra-linguistic. As is a nonhuman animal, to the degree to which it tends to express the mental pole of activity which language carries to its highest power.1
Affect negates freedom.  This is the unjustified conclu- sion some commentators have drawn from discussions  in affect theory of the famous ‘missing half-second’. This  refers  to  neurophysiologist  Benjamen  Libet’s discovery that there is up to a half-second lag in the
