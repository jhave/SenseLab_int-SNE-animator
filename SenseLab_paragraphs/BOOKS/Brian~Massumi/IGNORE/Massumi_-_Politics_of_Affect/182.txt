Brian Massumi: I agree that the potential is there, but I don’t agree that it’s inherent to affective politics. The mistrust of affect seems to come from seeing affect as a primitive stimulus–response system. I connect it instead to ‘priming’, which does not have the linear cause–effect structure of stimulus–response, but has to do  instead with modulation, which has to do with interference and resonance, which are nonlinear. Stimulus–response is a limit case. It’s that case of a habit that has become a reflex, lost its adaptive power, its powers of variation, its force of futurity, that has ceased to be the slightest bit surprised by the world. It’s a tired habit that has come as close to being an efficient cause as a power of repetition can get. It has let go of the ‘quasi’ in its cau- sality. There is also a sense in the critiques of affective politics as fascist that nonconscious process is an absence of thought. I follow Deleuze and Guattari in saying that nonconscious process is the birth of thought. It is ger- minal thought, moved by the force of time to express powers of existence in coming action.
From the critical theory point of view, I just compound the sin, because I think that advocating affective politics is advocating aesthetic politics. Aes- thetic politics is often also thought to be synonymous with fascism. I think about the connection between affective politics and aesthetic politics in terms of White- head’s idea of ‘contrast’. Contrasts are tendential unfold- ings that are held together in the same situation. They are alternative termini that come together in the instant, even though their actual unfoldings are mutually exclu- sive. Their mutual exclusiveness is a kind of creative tension. It is the contrasts between termini that interfere and resonate, and modulate what comes. The specious
