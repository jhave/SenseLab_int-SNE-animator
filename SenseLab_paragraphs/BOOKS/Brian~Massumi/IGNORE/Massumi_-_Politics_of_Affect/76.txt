Brian Massumi: Well, it requires a willingness to take risks, to make mistakes and even to  come  across  as silly. Critique is not amenable to that. And it suffers as a  consequence.  A  critical perspective  that  tries  to come to a definitive judgement on something is always in some  way  a  failure,  because  it  is  happening  at a remove from the process it’s judging. Something could have happened in the intervening time, or some- thing barely perceptible might have been happening away from the centre of critical focus. These develop- ments may become important later. The process of pinning down and separating out is also a weakness in judgement, because it doesn’t allow for these seeds of change, connections in the making that might not be activated or obvious at the moment. Being attuned to these possibilities requires being willing to take risks. In a sense, judgemental reason is an extremely weak form of thought, precisely because it is so sure  of itself. This is not to say that it shouldn’t be used. But I think it should be complemented by other practices of thought, it shouldn’t be relied on exclusively. It’s limiting if it’s the only or even the primary stance of the intellectual.
