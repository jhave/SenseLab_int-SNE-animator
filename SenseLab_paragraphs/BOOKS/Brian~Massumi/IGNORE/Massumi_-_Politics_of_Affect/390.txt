presence of a brain or, in animals with a brain, that function independently of conscious calculation. These include capacities that we would have to categorize as capacities to think. I have been writing recently about animality and instinct for a book called What Animals Teach us about Politics.1 I have been particularly taken with the insistence of certain scientists and theoreticians that there is improvisation and even problem-solving in animals without brains.
Darwin himself is one of the famous cases. He spent many years observing earthworms in his back garden. He talks about the improvisational prowess of earth- worms in relation to how they perform basic functions like the necessity to close the holes of their burrows to keep invaders or moisture out. He says that there is a general schema to their actions, but that each earth- worm, in spite of being brainless, is capable of improvis- ing new solutions that take the contingencies of each situation into account.

– then an improvisational variation playing on an instinctive activity, even in an animal without a brain, shows a certain degree or mode of mentality. This conception  of  mentality  breaks  down  the  Cartesian
