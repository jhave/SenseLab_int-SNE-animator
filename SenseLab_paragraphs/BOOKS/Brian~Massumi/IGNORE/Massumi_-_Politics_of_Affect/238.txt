They contaminate the field. They convert movements afoot in the field to their own ends. Among them are tendencies already moving in ways that lend themselves to capture – formative forces of emergence that come in a way conversion-ready. These ‘microfascist’ tendencies are Nietzsche’s ‘reactive forces’, which he analysed in The Genealogy of Morals under the concept of ‘ressentiment’. Reactive forces, in Deleuze’s words, are those which ‘separate other forces from what they can do’. They are tendencies towards repetition (reduction of difference), stabilization and rest (de-intensification), division and subsumption (divide and conquer). Deleuze develops a fascinating account of the relation between active and reactive forces in his book on Nietzsche.4 One of my earliest books, First and Last Emperors: The Absolute State and the Body of the Despot,5 explored the constitutive ten- sions of the reactive forces as they amplify in scale and play out society-wide. For the present discussion, the important point in the notion of microfascism is that there is no original state of freedom that is somehow fettered, but to which we can nurse the dream to return. The seeds of oppression are always already sown, and are always already in play. Affective dynamics not only
