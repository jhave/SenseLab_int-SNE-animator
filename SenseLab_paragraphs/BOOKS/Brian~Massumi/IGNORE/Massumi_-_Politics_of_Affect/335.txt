Erin Manning: What interests me in particular is how fields of relation agitate and activate to emerge  into what I think of as collectivities. I don’t mean human collectivities but ecological environments that include the human in its co-composing with the  nonhuman. This is what I call the ‘more-than-human’. To account for those emergent fields you need a vocabulary that touches on what Brian was talking about in his refer- ence to pastness within immediation as ‘a thinking- feeling in the immediacy of what’s coming’. Whitehead calls this non-sensuous perception, emphasizing that it is essential that we understand that there is a phase of experience previous to sensory experience that is capable of accounting for how the event immanently co-composes with pastnesses in the act. Experience in this phase is non-sensuous, according to Whitehead. The force of the past that is presenting itself cannot present itself in sense-perception, for the obvious reason that the sense- perceptions belonging to the past are in the past and stay there. The reason why this is so important to me is because the privileging of sense-perception tends to lead us directly to human subjectivity – to a subjective notion of memory as founding human subjectivity. If we begin there, with the subject, with sensuous perception, with subjective memory, we begin much later in the account. Rather than seeing how the immanent event creates an emergent ecology, and then becoming inter- ested in what this emergent ecology can do (how it expresses itself, how it is proto-political etc.), we take the human as a given and ask what it is doing in the event. This places the event at the mercy of the human, rather than placing the human as part of the ecology of the event. If we do the second, we are in a complex
