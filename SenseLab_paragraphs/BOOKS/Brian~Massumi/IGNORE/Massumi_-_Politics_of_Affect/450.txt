will. This divorces it from the body. But there is no unconditioned decision. And there is no individual, outside its own transindividual becoming, which takes effect through affect (not in reflection). The notion of individual will is sterile: it posits a vacuum of subjective reflection in which volition functions in glorious isolation, unconstrained and unconditioned. This is not freedom. This is a fiction. The nature– culture continuum abhors a vacuum. Freedom is not a property of a subject. There is no pure capacity of decision unmarked by necessity. Freedom is an achievement, attained of necessity. It is not exercised, it is invented, through the enabling modulation of constraints. Its invention is situational. Situations are eventful. And events are relational. Subjects don’t decide in a vacuum. Events decide, in relation. Freedom pertains not to the individual, but to process. Freedom is the transindividual autonomy of the affec- tive process to generate surprises. It is not without physicality – but it constitutes a triumph of mentality (once again by its affective-processual definition as the capacity to surpass the given and generate the new). Do not protest your freedom. Enact surprise. Speculate that.
