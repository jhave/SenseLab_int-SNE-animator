changing its very nature relative to the preceding frame of reference. A phase-shift of that kind is currently occurring, coinciding with the financialization of capital as analysed by such thinkers as Christian Marazzi.1 Financialized capitalism’s extreme complexity, precarity and pure operativity – so abstract an operativity as to be almost beyond all logic – spectacularly expressed themselves in the  2007–8  crisis.  The  financialization of capital complicates the scenario in fundamental ways. What does it mean to ‘personify’ a derivative? A credit default swap?
The call to go beyond ideology is a call to attend to the novelty of this situation, and to find ways of con- ceptualizing the current mode of operation of the capi- talist process, and the new kinds of spin-off effects it produces, that are capable of grasping its novelty and complexity. How can a relational approach give us a new understanding of capitalism as a self-proliferating process? What are the new figures of that relation? Is the figuring still a question of personification? If so, is identification still at the basis of the figures of capital? If capitalism’s operativity has become so complex, its ‘instruments’ so abstract, as to defy logic – and yet remain intensely effective – is it still a ‘rationality’? If it is not a rationality, how can we continue to speak of ideology – the very construction of which posits a logos, an ideational foundation? What does all this mean for resistance?
