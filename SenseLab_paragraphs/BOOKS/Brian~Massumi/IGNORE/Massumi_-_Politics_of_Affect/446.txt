the body always includes the abstract (that which exceeds the given) in its own self-extending defini- tion. Far from suggesting a physicalist reductionism, affect asserts that there is an expansive mental aspect, or what Whitehead calls a ‘mental pole’, to every bodily event.
Affect is prelinguistic. Every act of language involves an expression of affect. Affect is the infra-conditioning of every determinate activity, including that of lan- guage. The preferred prefix for affect is ‘infra-’. ‘Pre-’ connotes time sequence. But affect always accompa- nies, on the parallel track of potential. ‘Intra-’ is also imprecise, connoting as it does space and contain- ment (from interus, internal). ‘Infra-’ on the other hand connotes what actively lies below a certain threshold of appearance on an open-ended spectrum (as in ‘infrared’; from inferus, below). The threshold of appearance designates a turning point where the spectrum changes qualitatively in nature, while retain- ing the continuity of its constitutive gradations (as when infrared shades into the visible region of the spectrum, which is also the qualitative turning point where heat becomes light). There is no antinomy between affect and language. There is accompani- ment and becoming, always involving the full spec- trum of the graded continuum of experience. The nonverbal grades on the continuum of experience are not in opposition to the verbal registers, any more than infrared is opposed to red. They companion them (as any infrared camera will show). The infra- linguistic registers of experience accompany linguistic expression. At the same time (and this is where the infrared analogy  breaks down),  they are in-formed
