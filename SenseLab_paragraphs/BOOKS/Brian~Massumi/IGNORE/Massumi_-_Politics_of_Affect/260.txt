natural levels, is now felt in all its complexity, because we’re reaching certain tipping points, for example in relation to climate change and refugee flows. There is a sense that we’re in a far-from-equilibrium situation where each of the systems we have depended upon for stability is perpetually on the verge  of  tipping  over into crisis, with the danger that there will be a sort of cascade of effects through adjoining systems, like a domino effect. It’s a very unstable, quasi-chaotic situa- tion. And there’s no vantage point from which to under- stand it from the outside. We’re immersed in it. We’re absorbed in the imminence of catastrophe, always braced for it – which means it has become immanent to our field of life. That imminence-immanence is a mode of contact, of direct affective proximity, even if it occurs ‘at a distance’ through the action of the media or, more to the point, within an increasingly integrated media ecology.
When we talk about how affect works now, I think we have to start from the fact that we are all braced in that field of immi(a)nence. Our bodies and our lives are almost a kind of resonating chamber for media-borne perturbations that strike us and run through us, that strike us and strike beyond us simultaneously. This is all happening at a level before we can position our- selves, before we are able to step back and try to ration- alize the experience. We are braced into the experience, inducted into it in a very direct, bodily way, before we can adopt a considered posture towards it. That’s why I  talk  about  ‘immediation’  in  Semblance  and  Event.3
