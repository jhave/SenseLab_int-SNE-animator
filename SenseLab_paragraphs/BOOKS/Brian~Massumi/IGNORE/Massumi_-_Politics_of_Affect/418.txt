of language as the active involvement of nonverbal forces in the speech act. He gives a very simple example, of entering a field. You go in, without realizing that it’s occupied. Suddenly, you find yourself face to face with a bull, staring at you from across the paddock. Ducrot says that the dawning realization upon crossing the threshold of the situation catalyses a field of potential. Before you have had time to think, you have already sized up the mood of the bull. Without actually going through the steps of a calculation, you have already assessed how far you are from the gate. You have noticed, not quite consciously, whether there is mud and whether the ground is slippery. You have hypothesized which direction the bull might come at you from, where you might run in response. A whole field of potential composed of lines of potential action, and their enabling or disenabling conditions, breaks into your life. It all happens in an instant, in  an  interval  smaller  than the smallest interval of conscious reflection. Retrospec- tively, you might describe the event in a way that implies that you arrived at an awareness of the characteristics of the situation by inductive observation, or that you deduced which course of action would be best. But you didn’t actually perform these logical operations, with their separate steps. It all happened so quickly  that there wasn’t time for a logical operation. It all came at once, not as deduction, nor as an induction, but as what
C.S. Peirce calls an ‘abduction’: a realization that comes flush with perception’s dawning. This is not a logical operation, but a life operation. It is lived as a dimension of the live event. It was not you standing back and thinking about the event. It was the event thinking itself through  you.
