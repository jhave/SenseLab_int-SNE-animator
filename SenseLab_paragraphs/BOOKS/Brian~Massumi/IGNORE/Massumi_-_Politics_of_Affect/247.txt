Lazzarato. The concept of biopower raises special issues that must be grappled with if we are to think usefully about capitalism as a form of power. Capitalism in its current phase as a self-modulating, self-amplifying process that is immanent to the field of life is always escaping itself. It is continually leading itself into crisis, from which it always finds ways to re-emerge, as a further variation on itself. In this self-reinventive move- ment of escape, capitalism shares many of the charac- teristics of resistance. In its own destructive way, it works affectively to foster emergent tendencies, impro- vise amplifications – and in so doing, intensify powers of existence. But it does so in a way that is always and everywhere answerable to the capitalist relation, and the distinction it implants between money as means of payment and money as capital (in Marx’s shorthand, C-M-C′versus M-C-M′). Access to money as capital is by nature unequal, and the inequality has an inexorable tendency to increase.  Capitalism  augments  powers of existence, but does so essentially unequally. It may produce a surplus-value of life, but it is unequally distributed because it is always in the service of surplus- value in the monetary-capital sense, with all the inequal- ities that come with it, and all the brutalities that come with that inequality. In a word, capitalism captures resistance towards its own unequal processual ends.
Capitalism’s mantra is  ‘productivity’.  In  the  era of biopower, what bodies are meant to produce is essentially their own economically productive lives – integrally self-converting into ‘human capital’. Life itself has become integrally capital-intensive. Those away from whom the augmentation of powers of existence flows, those around whom the inequalities of the process
