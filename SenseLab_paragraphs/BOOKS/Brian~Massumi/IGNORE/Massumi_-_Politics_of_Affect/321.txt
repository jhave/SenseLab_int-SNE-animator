Erin Manning: I think so, yes. I don’t know if you’ve seen Ari Folman’s film Waltz with Bashir (2008)? It’s a film I write about in Always More Than One. I am thinking of it here in terms of this virtual share of expe- rience that can be made felt but isn’t actualized as such. When I was writing about the film, I knew that Waltz with Bashir was a film that was received quite badly by a number of left-wing academics in Israel and elsewhere, who criticized it for once more placing the Israeli experi- ence at the centre, thus making it all about Israeli suf- fering. I read it differently, though, focused as I was on the way life was portrayed, and especially this aspect of the preindividual. The question for me was how life can persist, or what form life can take after a horror such as the Sabra and Shatila massacre. One answer to this would be to place everything into humanist terms. This, I argue, is what Levinas does when he goes to Israel
