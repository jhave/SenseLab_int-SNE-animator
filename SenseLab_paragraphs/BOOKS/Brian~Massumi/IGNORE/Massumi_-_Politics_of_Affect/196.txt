constraints so that the situation is one of hospitality, not a test and not a show-and-tell. We tried to find very small, concrete ways of doing that, trying to anticipate the roadblocks that traditional events throw up. For instance, the moment of entry is crucial: how people enter an event implants all kinds of dynamics. Once they’re in, group dynamics becomes the next challenge. Take for example the plenary. You want some whole- group interaction, otherwise the event feels dispersed and no one leaves with a sense that anything happened. But plenaries are deadly. People zone out. A few people dominate. Others don’t feel empowered to speak. Dis- cussion get too general, with the same words being used with different connotations, and no one really connect- ing with what anyone else is saying. It’s deadly. But if you have small groups, how do you form them, and what do they do, so that they are not just plenaries in miniature? And if something really happens in a small group, which is where things are most likely to happen, how do  you convey  that to  the other  groups, or  the group as a whole? These were the kinds of questions we asked.
In answer to the question of how to form small groups, we tried to find affective mechanisms. For example, in the first event we organized we had a number of pieces of fabric that were very furry and soft with beautiful colours and patterns. To divide the par- ticipants into groups, we simply asked people to pick the pieces that most attracted them, and then to use the fabric to make the space for their interaction, by sitting on it or around it or by wrapping themselves in it, whatever moved them. So before the first word was exchanged in the group or the first task begun, people
