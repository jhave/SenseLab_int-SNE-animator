improvisational thinking-feeling. This way of thinking about politics in terms of contrasts and lived intensities of feeling is unmistakeably aesthetic in tenor. Whitehead was one of the first philosophers to create an aesthetico- politics. I find many resonances between his aesthetico- political approach and Félix Guattari’s ‘ethico-aesthetic paradigm’, in which I find much inspiration.3 The concept of the integral mutual inclusion of contrasts in a shared dynamic field is close to the notion of ‘differ- ential attunement’ I was using earlier. Whitehead’s prop- osition to make a fundamental value of the mutual inclusion of differences makes the invaluable point that the goal of politics need not be the overcoming of dif- ferences, or even their reconciling. Instead, the goal can be their rendering compossible, as different, with all the intensity that can be had in their eventful in-between.
