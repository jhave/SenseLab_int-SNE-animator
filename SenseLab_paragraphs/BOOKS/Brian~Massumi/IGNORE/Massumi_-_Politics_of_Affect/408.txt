been about. It’s the pop-out effect that says, to use the same example again, ‘this is a triangular event’. When you move to more complicated events, you have to find correspondingly complex ways of talking about the untimeliness of the virtual realities that characterize events. Platonic forms are just the simplest, most limited case. Without going into details now, in my talk last night I introduced a renewed concept of ‘value’ to talk about  this.
The logic of mutual inclusion I’ve been talking about is a logic of qualitative difference, taking modes of activ- ity (tendencies) as its object, rather than either objects in the substantialist sense, or subjects in the sense of an agency you could separate out from the event’s occur- rence. As Nietzsche said, there is no doer separate from the deed. One of the aims of this logic is to take account of the quantitative, of the plurality of countable ele- ments, but as part of a philosophy of qualitative becoming.
