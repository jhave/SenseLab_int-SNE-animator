recurrence. Tendencies are brought to serial expres- sion in and through events. What recurs in each event in the lineage is the immediacy of this evolving taking-form. Affect is the ongoing  immediation  of the social.
Affect’s social expression is in mass psychology. Mass psychology only understands the collective as a molar aggregate of individualities that have melted into an undifferentiated magma. This is understood to occur when the mediation of socializing mechanisms fails. This idea presupposes a notion of the individual body as the seat of biological impulses that are fundamen- tally irrational in nature, and must be curbed by culture, or sublimated. Affect calls this entire complex of ideas into question. As pure sociality, affect is by nature transindividual. ‘Transindividual’, however, is not synonymous with ‘collective’ in the mass psychol- ogy sense. To the contrary, it expresses itself in move- ments of correlated differentiation. In itself, it is hyper-differentiated: mutually including  all  manner of differentiations in potential. Finally, affect is not psychological. As transindividual, directly relational and immediately eventful, it overspills on all sides the interiority of the psychological subject. Psychology is a particular mode of expression of affect that indi- vidualizes it. Mass psychology is a logical conse- quence of this individualization: once an individual interiority is constructed, its affective overspilling of its assigned boundaries can only be understood as a de-differentiating melding. The excess of potential that immediates affect, that makes it the force of the social taking form, is mistaken for a magmatic lack of form.
