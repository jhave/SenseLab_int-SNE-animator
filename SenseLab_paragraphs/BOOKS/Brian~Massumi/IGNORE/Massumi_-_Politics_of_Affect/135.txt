Mary Zournazi: Well, that is the problem of charity. When you have pity for someone it doesn’t actually change the situation or give them much hope. But the other side of that is what you were talking about before, the idea of ‘caring for belonging’. There is such a focus on self-interest and the privatized idea of the individual (although this is changing through the new fields of capitalism and the economy) – the valorization of the individual against more collective struggles. This project has been trying to think about different notions of being, and collective life. In your ideas of autonomy and connection there is also another understanding or dif- ferent notion of care – ‘belonging’ and our ‘relations’ to ourselves and others. It involves some other idea of being that is anti-capitalist, and also different notion of caring . . .
