the present. Then there’s another kind of memory, a Kierkegaardian memory. Kierkegaard talks about how we ‘remember forwards, but recall backwards’. Recall- ing backwards is conscious remembering. Remembering forwards is the feeling of the attractor, the end point or terminus, making itself felt as the limit point of a ten- dency contracted in the past, and now reactivated. The attractor is a futurity, but it’s memory-like in that it only has futurity by virtue of contracting pastness. It pulls a contracted past through the crucible of the present, towards itself, the not-yet of this event. I think this idea of the terminus can be linked to what Whitehead calls an ‘eternal object’ (a misnomer if there ever was one, because it isn’t an object but a potential, and it isn’t eternal in the sense of enduring through time, but rather in the sense that it enters actively into the constitution of every moment).
So there are at least those three kinds of memory: a nonconscious memory of the present, which is the past actively contracted into the cut of the present instant (what I call the ‘here-and-now’ to differentiate it from the specious present that encompasses and unifies its fractal teeming and gives it the continuity of a duration); a memory of the past, which is a rear view of the past from the perspective of the consciously experienced spe- cious present of lived duration; and a felt memory of the future, which is the quasi-causal force of tendency taking effect, governed recursively by the futurity of the terminus towards which it tends. All of these forms of memory can operate at the same time, and in our waking lives they usually do. They are complements of each other.
