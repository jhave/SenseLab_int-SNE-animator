Erin Manning: There is a connection, but I’m thinking more of Derrida’s book Given Time and his work on Marcel Mauss.8 In the indigenous context, potlatch, the event of the gift, takes place in an attuning against war. The tribes come together. The potlatch is a ritual prac- tice that shifts the stirrings of the war-machine towards something else. This something else is not about the object per se, not about material conditions alone. It is about shifting the field, and in the case of the potlatch this happens not only through the giving, but also through the destruction of the gift. It is about the ritual, the field of relation in-act, and not about  the  actual thing in itself. In the context of the SenseLab, this idea of the gift of time – what is given, what is destroyed, what is left over from the destruction – is central to our thinking as regards strategies for collective practice. We are continuously searching for techniques that allow us to foreground this opening of the event onto its own forces for  giving time  – giving  time for  exploration, giving time for failure. Failure – like the destruction of the gift in the potlatch – is important to us precisely because it frees the event towards the unknowable, causing the event to reattune to the conditions at hand.
