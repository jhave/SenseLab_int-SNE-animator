Mary Zournazi: For me, this raises a question about the way capitalism does capture potential and organizes itself. There are two issues I want to address: firstly, in relationship to the question of hope – human aspira- tions and hopes are directly related to capitalism today. The natural or ‘potential of hope’ is seized upon and is tied very much to a monetary system, economic impera- tives or questions of ownership. Secondly, the relation- ship between hope and fear in capitalism. I think that hope and fear are part of the same equation. . .
