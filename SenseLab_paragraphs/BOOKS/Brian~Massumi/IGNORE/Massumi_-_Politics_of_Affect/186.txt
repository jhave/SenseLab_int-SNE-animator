Brian Massumi: It might not sound political, at least in the way it’s usually meant. But it is, because the vir- tuality is of an event to come, and as we saw before, the event always has the potential to affectively attune a multiplicity of bodies to its happening, differentially. Aesthetic politics brings the collectivity of shared events to the fore, as differential, multiple, bodily potential for what might come. Difference is built into this account. Affective politics, understood as aesthetic politics, is dissensual, in the sense that it holds contrasting alter- natives together without immediately demanding that one alternative  eventuate  and  the  others  evaporate. It makes thought-felt different capacities for existence, different life potentials, different forms of life, without immediately imposing a choice between them. The political question, then, is not how to find a resolution. It’s not how to impose  a  solution.  It’s  how  to  keep the intensity in  what  comes  next.  The  only  way is through actual differentiation. Different lines of unfolding bring the contrast into actuality, between them. The political question is then what Isabelle Stengers calls an ‘ecology of practices’. How do you tend this proliferation of differentiation?  How  can the lines not clash and destroy each  other?  How  do they live together? The ‘solution’ is not to resolve the tension through a choice, but to modulate it into a symbiosis. A cross-fertilization of capacitations that live out, to the fullest, the intensity of their coming together in the event, their belonging-together to the event.
