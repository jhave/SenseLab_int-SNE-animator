qualitatively different field of relation. They give the example of a tribal society and the production of axes for working the earth. If the production of axes goes beyond a certain quantity, the surplus is apt to be absorbed by another activity – fighting, for example. This might lead to a shift from limited ritual warfare to a new organization of war. This in turn might lead to social stratification around a new kind of warrior caste. The entire nature of the society will change. So there’s a quantitative threshold that coincides with a qualitative tipping point. The qualitative aspect is what really counts. Quantitative accumulation within the usual bounds is just more of the same. Their point is that the quantitative aspect of an economy, which we tend to think is what economics is all about, is doubled by a qualitative order, and that’s where the real, processual differences lie. When a threshold is crossed into a new relational field, everything re-jigs, what is valued in life changes, life is revalued.
Fundamentally, economies are qualitative economies of life-value, and the quantitative aspect is an index of that. Deleuze and Guattari say that there is an intuitive collective understanding of where the limits are for a given field. Not going past the limit, avoiding tumbling over into a new field, is a marker of people’s collective, affective investment, their differential attunement, towards staying in the relational field they’re in, not because of how much they get per se, but because of the life-values, the quality of life, that this relational field affords them. This is not of course a consensus. It can be a highly complex dynamic including opposing forces. In fact, the more complex the relational field, the more contested  its  limits  and  thresholds  are.  Deleuze  and
