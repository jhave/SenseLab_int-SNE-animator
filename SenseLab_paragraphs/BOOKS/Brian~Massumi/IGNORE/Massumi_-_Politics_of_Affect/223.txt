understand, in the very fibre of our being, what is at stake, and where things might be tending. The feeling of the transitional encounter is not ‘raw’ feeling. It is imbued with an immediate understanding of what is under way, what might be coming – and what we are becoming. This is enactive understanding: it is one with the action. It is what I call a thinking-feeling. Thinking- feeling corresponds roughly to C.S. Peirce’s category of ‘abduction’, which he considers the most primary of logical categories, lying at the root of the other, better- known logical modes, of induction and deduction.
It is clear that the affective thinking-feeling is not the thinking or feeling of a particular object – or a particu- lar subject. It pertains more directly to the event, what passes in-between objects and subjects, than to the objects or subjects per se. It is important to emphasize that it is pre-subjective, in the sense that it is so integral to the event’s unfolding that it can only retrospectively be ‘owned’, or owned up to, in memory and post facto reflection, as a content of an individualized experience. But it is even more important to realize that ‘pre- subjective’ in this usage means transindividual. Affective thinking-feeling is transindividual in two senses. First, in the sense just mentioned, namely that it pertains directly to what is passing between the individuals involved, which is reducible to neither taken separately. And second, in the sense that it coincides with a becoming of the involved individuals. As an event, it is already carrying each beyond itself, making it  other than it is just now, and already more than what it was just then.
Looked at from this perspective, affect is a differential attunement between two bodies in a joint activity of
