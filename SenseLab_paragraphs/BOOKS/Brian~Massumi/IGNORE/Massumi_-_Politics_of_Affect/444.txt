error. Given the transindividual nature  of  affect, the techniques must be effectively, if speculatively, collective.
Affect pertains to the body as opposed to the psychic or mental. This is a misunderstanding that often arises from the distinction between affect and emotion. If emotion is the capture of affect in the interiority of a subject, then, the reasoning goes, affect must be objective in contrast to the subjectivity of emotion. The attention that affect theory has rightly given to neurophysiological phenomena, par- ticularly those attesting to nonconscious dimensions of experience, has reinforced  this  false  opposition by seeming to indicate that affect pertains to the physical functions of the organ of the body that is the brain. Affect does pertain to the body, but the body figures here in an extended sense. The body of affect is extended first in the sense that it is not limited to  the  brain.  It  extends  throughout  the body through the innervations of the flesh. It encom- passes the nonconscious ‘body knowledge’ of habits, reflexes, the proprioceptive system, the many func- tionings of the autonomic nervous system, including the enteric nervous system or ‘gut brain’, and the myriad of sub-threshold experiences, or micropercep- tions, populating the body’s every move. These form feedback loops that continually inflect overall experi- ence without themselves rising to consciousness. They in-form thinking-feeling. The body of affect is extended in a more radical sense as well: it includes modes of activity normally designated as belonging to the mind. A habit, for example, is a power to generalize  (to  produce  an  operative  resemblance
