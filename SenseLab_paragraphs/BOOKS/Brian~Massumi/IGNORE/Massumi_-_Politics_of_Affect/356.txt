subjective point of view. It’s an active perspective – ways of moving in the world, ways of catalysing events, ways of expressing, ways of changing with and through the inflections of events. If the other is an image of poten- tial, then the multiplicity of others multiplies the poten- tial, way beyond what one individual can hold in itself. All of that potential can only be got at if it is activated relationally. To think of it this way connects the prein- dividual to the transindividual. Experimenting in acti- vating situational potentials pragmatically, inexploratory relational action, dissipates anxiety by reconnecting the preindividual to the transindividual. Again, freedom is not a question of the relation of the subject to itself. Freedom always comes out of active embeddedness in a complex relational field for the in-acting. One does not act freely. One acts freedom out.
