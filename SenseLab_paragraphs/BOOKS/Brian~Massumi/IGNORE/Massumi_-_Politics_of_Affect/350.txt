Brian Massumi: You can think of any example where you are in the situation where there is a power relation- ship. It is very clear, if you’re a professor and walk into a classroom, that you are immediately in a power situ- ation over the students. You can basically make them do what you want. You can tell them to give you a fifteen-page paper by a certain date and they do it or suffer certain consequences. The only reason that I have the power over them is because we are co-implicated in a situation that draws on certain institutional structures, and we have acquired the adaptive habits and skills they assume and produce. When I say that I have power, it is actually self-aggrandizing, because what I have is only the power to activate certain constraints and forces that are embedded in the relational field. When I act I am more of a catalyst for the reactivation of those forces than a direct commander or autonomous willer. That’s always the case, to one degree or another. Our freedom doesn’t consist in making a choice or decision that comes only out of our own subjectivity – in other words, out of nowhere. Our freedom is how we play our impli- cation in the field, what events we succeed in catalysng in it that bring out the latent singularity of the situation, how we inflect for novel emergences. That is a relational question, because it doesn’t happen part-to-part in billiard-ball fashion. If how you’re inflecting the event doesn’t resonate or interfere with everyone present, and affect all the formative factors integrally, the conformal forces that are ready and waiting in the situation are going to have the upper hand.
