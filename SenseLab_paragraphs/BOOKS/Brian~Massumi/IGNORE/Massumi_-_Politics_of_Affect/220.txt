Brian Massumi: The concept of affect that I find most useful is Spinoza’s well-known definition. Very simply, he says that affect is ‘the capacity to affect or be affected’. This is deceptively simple. First, it is directly relational, because it places affect in the space of relation: be- tween an affecting and a being affected. It focuses on the middle, directly on what happens between.  More than that, it forbids separating passivity from activity.
