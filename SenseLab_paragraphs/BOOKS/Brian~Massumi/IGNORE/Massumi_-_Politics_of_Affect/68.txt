Mary Zournazi: This makes me think of your idea of ‘walking as controlled falling’. In some ways, every step that we take works with gravity so we don’t fall, but it’s not something we consciously think about, because our body is already moving and is full of both constraint and freedom. I found it interesting because, in some other ways, I’ve been trying to think about another relationship – between perception and language – and it seems to me that ‘affect’ and this notion of body movement can provide a more integrated and vital way of talking about experience and language.
