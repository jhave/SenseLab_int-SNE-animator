The ‘autonomy of affect’ refers to the separation of the individual from the social. The autonomy of affect refers to the process by which the excess of potential that presses for expression is remaindered after every determinate taking-form, returning to in-form a next expression. The autonomy is of this process. The autonomy of affect is of the turnover of poten- tial on itself, towards the proliferation of ongoing variations on its expression of socially formative force.
Affect pertains to ‘raw’ experience. There is no raw experience. All experience is in-formed by prior takings-form. The manner in which prior takings- form in-form subsequent expressions is always inflected by how potential makes ingress into a situ- ation, with what gradations. The arc of potential’s entry into a situation and through it is always modu- lated on the fly, by very particular mechanisms. Prime among these mechanisms are the ‘abductions’ that texture the landscape of potential through which a coming event will wend its way, in the first flush of its incipiency. Abductions are ‘lived hypotheses’. They are thought in the immediacy of their enactment. This means that they are felt as directly as they are thought. They are thinking-feelings of the import of the situa- tion at hand, replete with competing tendencies and alternative paths. Their enactive nature qualifies them as gestures. Thinking-feelings are speculative ges- tures: they convoke potential and carry alternatives. As gestures, they do this with style. They do it with technique. There is no expression of affect without technique. It is the nature of affect to be already cul- tured with technique.
