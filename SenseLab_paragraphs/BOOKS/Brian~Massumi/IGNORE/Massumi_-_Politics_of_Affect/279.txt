We’ve seen this a lot around the work of the so-called ‘affective turn’ where the human remains the bearer and conduit of affect. So I’ve been interested in exploring, in my own work but also with Brian and in the events we organize together, what I call the various ‘speciations’ that ecolo- gies of affect produce. These ecologies are constituted biogrammatically or diagrammatically in the sense that they are tweakings of emergent tendencies for coales- cence within a co-emergent field of experience. They are neither human nor nonhuman – more like resonance machines that are activated in the between of the organic and the inorganic. I think of speciations – the elbow- table-lean of this conversation, for instance – as a kind of coming-into-emergence of a welling individuation that connects as a remarkable point or a point of inflec- tion to a wider field of experience – the summer, the house, the post-SenseLab-event conversation we are having. The singular ‘speciation’ of this current time- signature activates the wider field of relation towards certain tendencies.
