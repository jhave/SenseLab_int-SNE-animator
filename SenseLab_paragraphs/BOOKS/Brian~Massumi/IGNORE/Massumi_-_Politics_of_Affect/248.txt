They are not in a position to personify the self-productive powers of the process of capital at full intensity. They are bemoaned as insufficiently ‘productive’. They are left behind by the movement of capital. In a regime of biopower, they are as good as dead. The flipside of biopower is the ‘necropolitics’ theorized by Achille Mbembe in response to the debate on biopower.6

The task of resistance in the contemporary age is not just to fight power, it is to learn how to fight this ontopower. The battle that is being waged on resist- ance’s own home ground: ontopower against onto- power, on the same field of battle, flush with the same events, in immanent critique.
