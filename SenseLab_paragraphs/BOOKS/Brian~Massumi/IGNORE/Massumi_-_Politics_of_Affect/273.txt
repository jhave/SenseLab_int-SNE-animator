Brian Massumi: Yes, there is a nonlinear temporality to it. I refer to Deleuze’s time-image in Semblance and Event, but it’s not exactly the same concerns that I’m trying to explore in that book. I use the term ‘sem- blance’ to develop the idea that there are dimensions of an event that are not actually present but are necessary factors for its constitution.
Take something as simple as a line of movement. It makes no sense to take it as a sequence of points, because that abstracts the movement out of it. As Bergson said, all you get is a set of points, and points are fixed. The movement is not a sequence of points. It’s a folding of the immediate past into the present, as the present is turning over into the future, in a way that qualitatively changes a situation. The past and the future are necessary factors in the constitution of a trajectory of movement. But they are not actual, they’re alreadys and not yets. So when something is in movement, it’s exceeding itself dynamically, it is overspilling its actual- ity. It is more-than-present at each successive point. We understand that intuitively, we perceive it directly, without having to think about it. If you think of a politi- cal situation  and the kind  of collective differential attunement I was talking about – for example a disaster hitting that you have no way of knowing the exact nature or extent of yet – there’s a large number of poten- tial trajectories in play. The onset of the event crystal- lizes a field of potential movement. Think of it as a pragmatic field, made up of co-present vectors or poten- tial trajectories that are immediately felt, intuitively
