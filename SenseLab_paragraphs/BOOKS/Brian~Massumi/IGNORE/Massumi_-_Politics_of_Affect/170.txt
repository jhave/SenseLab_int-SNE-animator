Brian Massumi: There are different kinds of memory. There’s a kind of memory that’s directly implicated in any perception, couched in acquired or inbred inclina- tions and propensities that a body carries forward. This is a past that is not in any subjective representation, it’s a past that is only in its activation. It’s an enacted past, actively present. It’s not in the head, but in the middle, in rearising relationship, in situation. It’s as much like a thought as an action.
It’s like a thought in the sense that it has a certain generality. A tendency or propensity fuses, or contracts, a great number of past occasions into a readiness for a next. A habit or a skill is acquired through repetition. But once we have contracted it, we don’t have the rep- etitions, we have a capacity to redeploy a sequence of actions, including on-the-fly variations responding instantaneously to particularities of the situation. It’s an adaptive potential unfolding for the situation. It comes into the present as an inheritance of the past, but only to the extent that it is readying a future. This kind of memory is what Whitehead calls the immediate past, because it coincides with the immediacy of the present. It’s by nature nonconscious. It takes you, before you have it as your memory. It catapults you into unfolding tendency before any possibility of reflection. It might not be acted out. It might remain behind in the inaugu- ral commotion of the coming event. It might just agitate immanently, in which case it remains what Bergson calls a ‘nascent’ or ‘incipient’ action.
On the other hand, it might well catapult you directly into action. In either case the first making of the moment, the inauguration of the event, is that absolute coinci- dence between the past and the dawning present. Not
