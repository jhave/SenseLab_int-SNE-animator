– accept their place? Why can’t they see how the ration- ality coheres, and what it really means for them? Why don’t they get the idea? Why can’t they see through the mirage of the ‘general’ interest and understand it for what it is – a euphemism for the interests of a dominat- ing class?
This is where affect enters the picture for ideological analysis. The structure of ideas must be inculcated without making it explicit. The reigning rationality must be transmitted, but occulted, hidden, distorted. To do this, it must pass through another medium: it must be translated onto an affective register. The dominated classes must be induced to mistake their own interests for the mirage of the ‘general’ interest – and do so with passion. They must be duped into affectively investing in the mechanisms of power that oppress them, without ever noticing the contradiction. They must become the willing instruments of their own domination. This is most efficiently done by weaving ways of feeling and acting that are in consonance with the power structure of society into the habitual fabric of everyday life, where they go on working unexamined. Ideology works best when its structure of ideas is lived – acted out in the everyday, without being thought out (as in Bourdieu’s ‘habitus’).
The notion of ideology does not simply dismiss notions of affect. Rather, it mobilizes them in a particu- lar way. Affect is seen as fundamentally delusional. But its illusions are useful. It provides the invitational opening for a rationality to get its hooks into the flesh. Affect is the domain of ‘mere’ feeling. It represents the vulnerability of the individual to larger societal forces.
