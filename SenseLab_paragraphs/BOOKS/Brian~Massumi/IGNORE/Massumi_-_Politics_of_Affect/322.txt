shortly after the massacre and proclaims that there are times when we cannot face the neighbour, that some- times there are enemies, pure and simple. I argue that at crucial moments a humanist ethics tends to fall back into the most simplistic differentiation of self and other, friend and enemy – an identity politics – even when its aim is complex, as Levinas’s surely is. What Waltz with Bashir does, I suggest, is take us elsewhere, away from a humanist identity politics to a different kind of poli- tics, altogether different – one that troubles the very notion of the centrality of the face-to-face encounter – to ask us how the horror of the other’s face catapults us into an affective turn that destabilizes the very idea of ‘positioning’ that a politics of recognition presup- poses. What Waltz with Bashir does that is so powerful
and it does this through the movement of the image, the intensity of colour and sound, as much as or even more than through the narrative – is provoke another way of engaging with the as-yet-unthinkable (or as-yet- unfaceable). One of the ways it does this is by continu- ously disengaging affect from the face of the human
the human face moves from shot to shot in an expres- sionless sameness. What is active in the film is another kind of affective politics, one, as Brian might say, of bare activity – a welling of experience in the making. What’s important to me here is that we find ways of conceiving of a complex politics that moves beyond humanism towards a concept of life that troubles cat- egories we too often feel are predetermined. This leads, perhaps, to a more complex notion of coexistence.
What I am proposing with Waltz with Bashir is similar to how I approached Leni Riefenstahl’s films in my book
