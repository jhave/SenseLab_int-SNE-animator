Joel McKim: Part of what made me interested in unfold- ing a little bit these different variations of memory is a notion you brought forward at the beginning of your comments, the idea that the affective shift into a differ- ent power of being carries with it a memory. A memory that also then becomes potentially reactivated or could change the experience of the body in another situation. You mentioned that these shocks occur at a microper- ceptual level and that thereâ€™s an after-the-fact conscious duration that we experience and we hold with us that is actually quite different than the original micropercep- tual shock experience. Could the memory that this affective qualitative change carries with it be described as a becoming sensitive to those microperceptual shocks? So can we begin to become more aware of these affec- tive shocks that are obviously influencing us or having an impact on us continuously? Is that part of the poten- tial process?
