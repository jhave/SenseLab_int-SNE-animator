conscious dawning of an action from the onset of its physiological stirrings. In the lag, the coming action is moving from its own ‘readiness potential’ to its actual expression: from its in-acting as potential to its acting-out in gesture. What has bothered many people is that the transition is always already on its way nonconsciously, which is taken to mean that it negates freedom of decision. The idea that this non- conscious incipiency of action contradicts freedom must be revised in the light of what was said earlier about the  mutual  inclusion of  mental  and physical movements in every act’s emergence. The erroneous idea that affect negates freedom results from a refusal to fundamentally rethink the body/mind duality: it construes the nonconscious activity of the body as purely ‘physical’ or ‘physiological’ as opposed to ‘mental’, and equates the physical with ‘unthinking’ mechanism. Affect theory, quite to the contrary, pre- supposes the mutual inclusion  in every event of  a physical pole (defined as the tendency of an event to conform to the ordering it inherits from the immedi- ate past) and a mental pole (defined as the tendency to surpass the given, to produce the new and generate surprise). Affect in no way excludes freedom. It does, however, require it to be redefined. The redefinition is necessary because the workings of affect do con- tradict freedom, if freedom in any way implies the body/mind, physical/mental duality. These dualities are so entrenched in conceptions of freedom that it is difficult for many to bend their thinking-feeling past them. Received ideas about freedom style it as the mental act of an individual psychological subject, or as an unconditioned decisional act of an individual
