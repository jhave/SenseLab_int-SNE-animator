say – even though there are certain presuppositions that get performatively implanted in the field, and certain tendencies already vectorizing it, in a kind of proto- organization of what is happening. The main point is it’s  all  happening  far-from-equilibrium,  so  that  what counts is the fielding of instability, and the fact that unpredictable   order-out-of-chaos   effects   can   always disable, deviate or reconfigure any pre-organization. So when  I’m  talking  about  affect  I’m  talking  about  a directly relational immersion in a field of immi(a)nence from	which	determined	actions	and	determinate thoughts  have  to  emerge.  They  have  to  be  extracted from the field of complexity on the fly, performatively. The  question  then  becomes,  what  modulates  the extraction?  Overall  it’s  modulated  by  the  feeling  of threat that comes with the sense of emergency, and by the securitization procedures that have been set in place in response. But securitization assumes instability. Secu- rity is not the opposite of insecurity. It’s wed to it. In his book on trust and power, Niklas Luhmann is clear about that.4  To produce security with any regularity, he says, you have to produce the insecurity it’s predicated on. Foucault makes the same point. Security measures have to be taken pre-emptively, because we’re always caught in the first flush of something happening under complex emergency conditions, before it can be known where it will go and what it will become. Security meas- ures have to bootstrap order back out of quasi-chaos.
I’ve argued that this qualifies them as procedures of becoming, or what I call ‘ontopower’.
