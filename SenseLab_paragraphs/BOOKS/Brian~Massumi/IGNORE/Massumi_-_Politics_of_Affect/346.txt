it perishes. If there is apparent continuity – even at the level of a rock, as the power of persistence of a rock – it’s because a capability has set in to regenerate the same form across the perishings, so that the next emergence is more similar to than different from the last. White- head says this very clearly: a rock is an accomplishment. Something from the past creates conditions of conform- ity for the next emergence, and it is the reuptake of these by the new occasion which accounts for the continuity of lines of existence. Whitehead defines re-enaction as it is in conformity to the past as the ‘physical pole’ of events. He defines the ‘mental pole’ of events as what introduces novelty into the re-enaction, and jumps ahead from there. Fundamentally, that means appeti- tion, as Erin was just discussing – the singularizing force of futurity. It is crucial to realize that the mental pole as Whitehead defines it has nothing to do in the first instance with human thought or subjectivity. You have to think the emergence and the perishing, the conformal persistence and rearising, the cut of the new and the continuity, the physical and the mental, together, as mutually imbricated modes of process. As phases of process they are always interlinked, and are found to one degree or another in every event at any level of existence.
On the question of effectiveness. When we talk about effectiveness, we’re usually thinking about what phi- losophers call efficient causality. It’s the idea that an effect is directly proportionate to its cause, that the cause  can  be  isolated  from  background   activity, and then connected in linear fashion to its effect. It’s basically  the  billiard-ball  model,  where  the  future  is
