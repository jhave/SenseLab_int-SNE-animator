power deals with big unities – the person as moral subject, right and wrong, social order. And everything was internalized – if you didn’t think right you were in trouble. Now you’re checked in passing, and instead of being judged innocent or guilty you’re registered as liquid. The process is largely automatic, and it doesn’t really matter what you think or who you are deep down. Machines do the detecting and ‘judging’. The check just bears on a little detail – do you have enough in your bank account, do you not have a gun? It’s a highly localized, partial exercise of power – a micro- power. That micropower, though, feeds up to higher levels, bottom up.
