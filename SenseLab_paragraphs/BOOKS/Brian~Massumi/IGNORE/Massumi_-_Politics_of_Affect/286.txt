had a disability – what was disabling about this wonder- ful game of perception he had been playing? – but that all the non-speaking moving things in his life were in fact also autistic – the curtains, the fan. What great company!
Tito uses this story to explain that there is no lack of communication here, no lack of empathy – but rather a kind of hyper-relationality that does not settle for the human as its point of focus. He emphasizes that in the doctor’s office he was very much part of the welling speciation room-light-movement, and that this specia- tion was very much intertwined with an emergent relational field in which he was intensively active. The suggestion becomes: we, ‘neurotypicals’, are so busy looking for human–human modes of communication that we too often overlook these emergent ecologies. In addition, we place identity politics and empathy on the same level and assume that communication is limited to human–human interaction. In doing so, we negate the force of the radically empirical and dismiss the myriad speciations in our midst.
