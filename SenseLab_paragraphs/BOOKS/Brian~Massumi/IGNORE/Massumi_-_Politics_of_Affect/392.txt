distinction between the mental and the physical, but without simply collapsing them into each other, or bracketing one out. It forces you to rethink how you define the physical and the mental, how you parse them together.
For Whitehead, the physical dimension of the body corresponds to actions performed in conformity to the past, continuing along the same lines as it, following the same schema. Thus the physical is a principle of conformity to already-emerged form. What charac- terizes mentality is the capacity to go beyond that givenness to improvise new forms. Note that I said ‘mentality’, and not ‘the mind’. Here, mentality is a mode of activity, and it functions not in opposition to the physical but with it and through it, by prolonging and renewing it.
Every instinctive action performed by animals – and what action could be  said not to have  an instinctive basis? – has to have both of these elements, the mental and the physical. It has to work them together, other- wise the animal’s actions will be completely maladap- tive. If an instinct were incapable of creating variations on its own theme, of inventing new flourishes, new forms for its own operation, then it could  do  little more than respond to the environment in a stereotyped way. This would be fine if the environment did not change. But the environment is always changing. So the animal’s instinctive activity has to wrap itself around changes in the environment. It has to change apace with the changes. That could be defined as a first degree of creative mentality, occurring at the level of a body as a pre-reflexive operation, prior to and independent of self- reflective consciousness.
