than towards the structures into which the gestures of microfascism occurring on the same level, in the same field, have the tendency to channel. All of this is very consistent with Gabriel Tarde’s micro-sociology of ‘imitation’. But it also reinforces the notion that there is an aesthetic dimension – of allure, of style of gesture
– that is not an added dimension but is absolutely inte- gral to the very operation of resistance, one with its politicality.
There is only one a priori: participation, participatory immersion in bare activity. Resistance comes of imma- nence. It cannot be led. If it is, it is already coagulating into an apparatus of capture poised to rise up and bear down, as if from above and outside. Resistance is imma- nent critique: a ‘critique’ that is one with its enaction. It occurs at the level on which bodies think more actively and feel more thinkingly, towards acting differently together. In this kind of resistance, there is no avant- garde. There are seeds. Seeds of free action blowing in the winds of bare activity, looking for a fertile field of attunement for their flowering. The analogy is inexact. Such a field does not exist. In its role as exemplary gesture, resistance creates its own field. It gestures it into existence, by its own power of contagion. Resist- ance is performative of itself. It triggers its own self- organizing. Its field is always to come, flush with its own self-amplifying event.
Immanent critique, as its name implies, cannot purport to  apply  already-established   criteria   of   correctness or necessity to the field of collective action. It cannot operate in the imperative, based on a prior political programme or already structured set of moral precepts. It  cannot  justify  itself  by  appealing  to  established
