relation’. The challenge for each event is to find the enabling constraints and techniques of relation that tailor the event to what’s singular about that particular coming together. To do that, you need to know some- thing about what moves the people who will come. So there are pre-event techniques for relation that have to be in place to prepare the ground. And the post-event collaborative developments are crucial to network, because that is where what happened in the event really eventuates.
For us it’s very important that what transpires be gathered in language. We’re both writers. We both think of what we do as philosophy. So we always try to create a real, effective presence of philosophy. But not as a master discipline that judges other kinds of practice. We see it as a symbiosis, where practices that are not pri- marily linguistic are seen to bear active conceptual force that can be brought to explicit verbal expression, and by being brought into language can cycle back into the practice from which they develop to spur it further. We approach philosophy as Deleuze and Guattari define it, as the creation of concepts whose mission is to augment capacities to act, feel and perceive, in addition to think. So we approach philosophy as a creative practice in its own right, with its own material and mode of activity, which is language. Another challenge: other techniques of relation have to be invented to foster this reciprocity between different modes of creative activity and their respective materialities. A great deal of our thinking about and experimenting with event design is concerned with this, not only in our special events but in the regular day-to-day functioning of the SenseLab group, locally as well as remote, through an internet group hub.
