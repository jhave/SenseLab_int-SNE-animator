the mico-perceptual by the war-machine that deserves serious study.2
In speaking at this level, we have to be careful. If we say, ‘I contract habits and then habits rule me’, or ‘We can remobilize habit for futurity’, we are positing a subject, us or me, prior to and separate from the process of event-formation that habit is so central to. ‘I’ do not contract habits. Habits contract to form me. That’s taking ‘me’ to be the relational matrix of reactivation that my body carries forward – which is my body as I defined it before. ‘My’ comes before ‘me’. Leibniz insisted that being is in the possessive, not the first person. My comes before me; repetition comes before identity. And repeated difference, Deleuze adds, always trumps identity.
