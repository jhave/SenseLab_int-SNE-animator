Jonas Fritsch: I’d like to talk about the dynamics of this particular field of relations. It feels as though it is both over-structured in a way – that you’re caught in a kind of web – but also at the same time that it’s over-open, in the sense that there are always different ways out. That kind of dynamic, I think, is best captured by dis- tinguishing between attunement and the concepts, for instance, of transmission that you were talking about before. That idea of the transmission of affect is some- thing that runs through the whole discourse on affect today. What is the difference between notions of the transmission or contagion of affect and the notion of attunement?
