If there is one key term, that’s it: relation. When you start in-between, what you’re in the middle of is a region of relation. Occurrent relation, because it’s all about event. Putting the terms together, you realize straight away that the relational event will play out differently every time. In repeating, it takes up the past differently. In taking up the past differently, it creates new poten- tials for the future. The region of occurrent relation is a point of potentiation. It is where things begin anew. Where things begin anew is where they were already present in tendency.
If there are two key terms, tendency comes next. The patterns of movement through these affective transi- tions are weighted for a particular body or particular situations, as more or less accessible, more or less ready to go. There’s an activation not only of the body, but of the body’s tendencies, as they move into and through situations. In taking account of this, you get a relational complex, a nexus, rather than a particular definition. The base definition – to affect and be affected, in a felt passage to a varied power of existence – opens a prob- lematic field rather than ending in a particular solution. You are left with a matrix of variation that forces you to rethink the terms involved each time. You have to regenerate them to use them. It’s not a general definition that you can apply. It’s not a structure you can presup- pose. On the other hand, it’s also not the case that you’re starting without any presuppositions. To start in the middle is precisely not to perform a phenomenologi- cal reduction. It is to accept the challenge to regenerate your terms, and their cohesion to each other, at each repeated step in your thinking through the nexus. Rather than a definition, what you have is a proposition, less
