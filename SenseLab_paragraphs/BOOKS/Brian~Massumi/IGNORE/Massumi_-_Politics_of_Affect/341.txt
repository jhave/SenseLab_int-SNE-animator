Erin Manning: This is an important point. I think we have to dissociate Brian’s ideas of bare activity, or my focus on the in-act, from the way activity is mobilized by capitalism. Bare activity has nothing to do with ‘doing something’ in the sense of that capitalist busy- ness. As Brian often says, its not doing something, it’s ‘something doing’, emphasizing, as I did earlier, how the event’s own coming into act is what is at stake, not only the human subject’s activity in the event. Something doing is never limited to human doing: it asks instead how the doing effects the field of relations active in the event. Some of the effects are definitely human effects, but these are always in a constellation that is more-than human. Activity is therefore never reduced to what the human does, as tends to be the case in work that criti- cizes action as a concept (such as Bifo’s [Franco Berar- di’s] account of activism, for instance). It has to do instead with the generative potential of ecologies in their coming to be an event.
