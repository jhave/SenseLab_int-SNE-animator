understood, in an intensely embodied way, that call everyone to attention and energize us towards action
– but are not yet actualized, that are more-than-present in their potential. That felt potential is the jumping-off point, it’s in the very first flush of what’s coming, so it can be treated as a presupposition of the event’s unfold- ing. The potential is pragmatically presupposed.
So a way of thinking about this politically is in terms of pragmatic presuppositions that are perceptually felt without being thought out, but that retrospectively you could separate out as if they were the result of a judge- ment or a deduction or an inference. But this activation of presupposed potentials happens so quickly that no such judgement could have been made. It’s completely on the level of immediate perception, even though it’s non-actualized. You’re non-sensuously feeling it. It’s a kind of thinking-feeling of what’s happening, including what may happen. The thing is, our thinking-feeling of what may happen includes what other people may do, in correlated but differential response, each following their particular tendencies. In a situation of disaster, the col- lective rush to safety may block a trajectory. Or someone may be already spontaneously offering a helping hand, setting an example to others that works like a kind of unplanned propaganda of the deed. At the very onset of an event, there are any number of these tendencies and condition-setting deeds coming together to create and modulate the unfolding of a very complex vectorial field that is directly collective – transindividual.
That’s what we’re experiencing today, that’s what we’re living, that’s what we’re thinking-feeling moment by moment in this atmosphere of crisis and impending
