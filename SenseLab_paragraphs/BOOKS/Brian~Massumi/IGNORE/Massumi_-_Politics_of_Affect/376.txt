others take up your gift of potential, they take it places you couldn’t have taken it by yourself – which then enables you to go places you couldn’t have gone alone. When an event of this kind is working, a dancer might move into a philosophical text in a way they never thought they had the preparation to do. And a philoso- pher might find themselves translating concepts into movements. When things like that happen, it deserves to be called an event. Events are always transindividual, bringing out potentials that could never have been arrived at individually.
The use of language in this kind of situation is very different. On the one hand, it is procedural in Arakawa and Gins’s sense. It is used to embed certain set of potentials in the situation in an open-ended way that can only be brought to expression collectively. On the other hand, the use of language is necessarily evocative, because what will transpire has not been predetermined, but has to eventuate, and how it eventuates is up for relational grabs, and will only be clear as the event unfolds. This evocativeness of potentials as yet not fully formed gives the procedural language a poetic edge. You can see this poetico-procedural use of language in Arakawa and Gins’s writing. You can read it as poetry, and you can use it as an instructional manual for expe- riential event-making.
