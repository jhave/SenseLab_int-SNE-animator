arts modulate the affective force of a combat encounter, that means that there are affect modulation techniques accessible in the event. They become accessible to the event through reflex, habit, training and the inculcation of skills – automaticities operating with as much dynamic immediacy as the event, directly as part of the event. These automaticities cannot be reduced to slavish rep- etition, a lack of freedom to  manoeuvre.  In  fact,  as any musician will tell you, they are the necessary foun- dation for improvisation. You can only effectively improvise on the basis of elaborate forms of enactive knowing that operate with all the automaticity of a ‘second nature’. What I am suggesting is that affect can be modulated by improvisational techniques that are thought-felt into action, flush with the event. This thinking-feeling of affect, in all its immediacy, can be strategic. Since it modulates an unfolding event on the fly, it cannot completely control  the  outcome.  But  it can inflect it, tweak it. So it is not strategic in the sense of preconceiving a specific outcome in  all  its  detail and finding the means to arrive at that intended end. It is all means – all in the middle, in the midst, in the heat of encounter. It is directly participatory, at no dis- tance from the event under modulation. It is the tweak- ing of an arc of unfolding, on the fly. It is therefore more akin to the deflection or inflection of an already active tendency than the imposition of a prescribed intention, or pre-intended prescription. But the inflection of ten- dency can also accumulate from one encounter to the next, and lead somewhere new. It can amplify, resonate or even bifurcate – potentially in ways that don’t coagu- late into a power structure, but instead keep restructur- ing, keep the structuring alive. This is not a ‘rationality’.
