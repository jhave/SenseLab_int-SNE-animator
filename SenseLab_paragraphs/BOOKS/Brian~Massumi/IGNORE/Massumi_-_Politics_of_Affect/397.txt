pole and a physical pole; a mental dimension and a physical dimension; a tendency towards abstraction or extraction from the given, and a tendency towards the stability to be had by prolonging forms of givenness. When you get rid of the substantives, what you are left with are adverbs – qualities of events.
If you say, ‘Isn’t life the answer?’ to the question what a body can do, the answer is ‘Yes’. But you have to make life an adverb: lively. It’s about liveliness or liveness. There is no life substance. Life is not a thing. Life is the way in which the mental and physical poles of events come together – differently every time, always under singular circumstances, moving in the general direction of the accumulation in the world of differences, of improvised novelty. Whitehead says that life is in the intervals between things – in the way things relate, in the way they come together in events under the domi- nant tendency towards the generation of new forms, or ontogenesis.
The tendency towards ontogenesis cannot operate without the contrasting tendency towards homeostasis. Life can’t always live at the limit. It can’t continue to survive if it is always pushing to the limit of intensity, creating new forms. It needs a degree of stability, oases of rest. It cannot be chaotically far-from-equilibrium at all times. It has to find its footing, to brace itself for new becomings. This means that life is the movement between the mental and physical poles, between conformation and supernormal excess, between one event and another, between all of the various factors in play. Life lives in the gaps. Still, what I just called the supernormal ten- dency, corresponding to the mental pole, is the domi- nant tendency. Life is biased in its direction – otherwise
