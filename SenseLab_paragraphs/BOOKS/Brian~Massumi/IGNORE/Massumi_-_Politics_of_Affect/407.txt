can interpenetrate, without losing their own character. Each tendency is characterized by a certain mode or rhythm of unfolding. Bergson calls it a ‘theme’, as in music. His idea is that in the incipience of an experience, at that pre-reflective level, where thinking is just coming about, at a level which cannot be separated from the body, there is an activation of a multiplicity of tenden- cies in a state of mutual interpenetration. The mutual inclusion is of tendencies activating without yet unfold- ing. But they are all together in the activation, resonat- ing and interfering with each other, agitating among themselves to come to expression. This is what I call bare activity. What ends up occurring is a resolution of this bare-active tension. A dominant tendency might end up expressing itself, or it’s possible that a new ten- dency will emerge from the agitation. Even when a dominant tendency expresses, it will have been inflected in some way by its birth pains. It is only when the reso- lution comes that pluralities and unities appear. The tendential multiplicity expresses itself in a co-occurring of countable elements and pop-out unity effects. So you have a logic that has three levels, or dimensions: ten- dential multiplicity (qualitatively different modes of activity that you can’t separate out temporally or spa- tially); plurality (the diversity of discrete, countable ele- ments that are spatialized); and the unity of those elements (a virtual pop-out effect, which appears in space but without occupying it, and fills the moment with a timeless figure, in the case of the example I used, a Platonic form).
All three dimensions enter into every event. It is the last aspect, the reality of the virtual, that finally charac- terizes the event, that expresses what it will have all
