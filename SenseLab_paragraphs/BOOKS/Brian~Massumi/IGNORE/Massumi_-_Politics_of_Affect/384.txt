us, on the contrary, the aesthetic is immediately in con- nection with necessities of life. There have to be stakes for any activity to be compelling. The reason why a lot of people are drawn to the kinds of events the SenseLab organizes is that they feel they are beaten down in the situations they live in every day in their home contexts and institutions. It is not that there is no freedom in institutional contexts, but the options for resistance are pre-formatted by the modes of conformity that come to dominate the situation. There is little room for inven- tion. People come to our events out of a sense of neces- sity, as an issue of survival. Many feel held back or battered down, and can’t see how to keep going. They may feel chronically fatigued, or that their creative potential is being drained. Their powers of resistance have been taxed too many times, and they’re looking for some way to recharge. It’s not an escape into an aesthetic field of free choice and unfettered expression. It’s a life necessity. What we provide in response to these yearnings isn’t an unconstrained environment. We often repeat: if anything goes, nothing will come. What we do is set in place, poetico-procedurally, enabling con- straints. These are mechanisms designed to set certain conditions in place allowing for an inventive interaction to occur that is something like a structured improvisa- tion. The situation is positively constrained: conditioned in a way that we hope will create the conditions for a process of collective expression to unfold, in the course of which something unexpected might emerge. The hope is that what does emerge might feed forward into further experimentation, beyond this event’s perishing, in a kind of contagion of collective potential. For us the aesthetic is not an escape from life. Quite the opposite:
