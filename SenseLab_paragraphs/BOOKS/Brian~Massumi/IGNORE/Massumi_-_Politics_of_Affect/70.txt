hand and a matching perception on the other, then it starts coagulating. It’s just being used as a totally con- ventional system for pointing out things you want other people to recognize. It’s all about pointing out what everyone can agree is already there. When you think about it, though, there’s a unique feeling to every experi- ence that comes along, and the exact details of it can never be exhausted by linguistic expression. That’s partly because no two people in the same situation will have had exactly the same experience of it – they would be able to argue and discuss the nuances endlessly. And it’s partly because there was just too much there between them to be completely articulated – especially if you think about what was only there potentially, or virtu- ally. But there are uses of language that can bring that inadequation between language and experience to the fore in a way that can convey the ‘too much’ of the situ- ation – its charge – in a way that actually fosters new experiences.
Humour is a prime example. So is poetic expression, taken in its broadest sense. So language is two-pronged: it is a capture of experience, it codifies and normalizes it and makes it communicable by providing a neutral frame of reference. But at the same time it can convey what I would call ‘singularities of experience’, the kinds of affective movements we were talking about before that are totally situation-specific, but in an open kind of way. Experiencing this potential for change, experiencing the eventfulness and uniqueness of every situation, even the most conventional ones, that’s not necessarily about commanding movement, it’s about navigating movement. It’s about being immersed in an experience that is already under way. It’s about being
