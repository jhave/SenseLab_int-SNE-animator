Erin Manning: Affect is a way to account for experience in its in-forming. In both our writing and in the work at the SenseLab, Brian and I often focus on affect because our concern is with how emergent experience composes in ways that are proto-political. Our recent emphasis on immediation comes out of this concern. As you know, given that you’re a participant in the new project phase at the SenseLab which we’ve called ‘Imme- diations’, we are interested in drawing attention to how the stakes of experience occur in the immediate inter- stices of its coming to be. As Brian emphasizes, this coming to be does not in any way rule out the force of pastness. In fact, one of the things immediation as a concept does is emphasize the nonlinearity of the time of the event, or what I sometimes call event-time. Event- time emphasizes time’s affective force, in the event. This affective force is laden with both pastness and futurity, but in a way that is singularly active in the now of experience.
