are only part of the political equation, and it’s not the part that the affective politics we’ve been talking about specifically addresses. Micropolitics is not program- matic. It doesn’t construct and impose global solutions. But it would be naïve to think that it was separate from that kind of macro-activity. Anything that augments powers of existence creates conditions for micropolitical flourishings. No body flourishes without enough food and without health care. Micropolitical interventions need macro solutions. But success at the macropolitical level is at best partial without a complementary micro- political flourishing. Without it, the tendency is towards standardization. Since macropolitical solutions are gen- erally applicable by definition, by definition they act to curtail the variety and exuberance of forms of life. Mac- ropolitical intervention targets minimal conditions of survival. Micropolitics complements  that by  fostering an excess of conditions of emergence. That inventive- ness is where new solutions start to crystallize. The potentials produced at the micropolitical level feed up, climbing the slope that macropolitics descends. Micro- political and macropolitical go together. One is never without the other. They are processual reciprocals. They aliment each other. At their best, they are mutually cor- rective. Even macro solutions designed to curtail micro- political activity often end up feeding it by making it a necessity to invent new ways of getting by and getting around. Creative variation is the only real constant of politics. Deleuze and Guattari often made this point, for example in their slogan that the state is built on what escapes it.
It has become a commonplace recently to say that we are in a situation where the end of the world is now
