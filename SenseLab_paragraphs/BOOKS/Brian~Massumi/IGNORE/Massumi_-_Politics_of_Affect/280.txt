a matrix of identity (‘the’ animal, ‘the’ human), but through speeds and slownesses of welling co-constitutive ecologies. Thinking this way perhaps allows us to con- sider how fields of resonance, or what Simondon calls ‘associated milieus’, emerge not through identity struc- tures (the human, the self) but through ecologies that are as much rhythms as ‘beings’ – different scales and inten- sities of time. This may in turn enable us to get beyond identity politics (as it continues to exist even within politics of affect) and explore the immanent coexistence of a relational third – what I have elsewhere called the interval. When the interval becomes an active part of what the event-constellation can do, we find ourselves in a ‘radical empiricism’ without a preconditioned sense of what the terms of the relation consist of. This, I think, is what we try to do with the SenseLab events and with our inquiries into new forms of collaboration. We ask: what does this third do? How does it speciate? What does it co-create? What kind of ecology is it?
I say this knowing that all speciations do culminate to some degree in species or categories. The point is not that there is no identity – no human, no animal, no plant
but that the species is not where the process begins or ends. Our proposition is not to negate species or iden- tity, but to become aware that the force of speciation, of collective individuation, happens in the interstices where the ecologies are still in active transformation. In my own terms I would say that what is made possible by this approach is an opportunity for a kind of choreo- graphic thinking which I define not as the imposition of a choreographic score, but as the creation of tools that enable the mobile diagram of speciations to come to the fore – a kind of incipient diagrammatic praxis.
