Marx does not just say that the capitalist identifies with the capitalist structure of society, and that the worker becomes affectively invested in it. He says that the capi- talist personifies the capitalist relation’s power to produce, and to appropriate productive forces ever more extensively, and ever more intensely. The worker personifies the potential for the capitalist relation to continue to appropriate productive forces as it prolifer- ates and intensifies its operations – but also the potential that its operation hit a wall (of fatigue, of sabotage, of resistance). In other words, worker and capitalist are figures of capital. They index its constitutive tensions and tendencies. They are products of its process that figure the relational dynamic of its operations. These processual figures can then be fed back into the process to generate second-order effects (effects of processual self-reference).
Relation comes first, ontologically vis-à-vis persons, as well as politically vis-à-vis structure. Relation is primary. Since the capitalist relation proliferates in an open, complex, changing, fundamentally unpredictable field of ever-occurring events, its spin-off effects cannot be entirely stablized. The regularization is only ever provisional, the stability only ever a ‘metastability’, a provisional stability. Differences we identify as class differences (expressing the effects of unequal distribu- tion) are continually produced by the capitalist process
emphasis on ‘continually’. The capitalist process is continually in the process of refiguring itself, as it navi- gates the complexity of its stochastically challenged, open field of operation. What class means, what differ- ences that notion figures, change fundamentally from one  phase  of  capitalism  to  another,  to  the  point  of
