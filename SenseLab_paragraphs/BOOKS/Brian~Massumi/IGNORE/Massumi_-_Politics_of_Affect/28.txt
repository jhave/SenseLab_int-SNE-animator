Erin Manning holds a University Research Chair in Relational Art and Philosophy in the Faculty of Fine Arts at Concordia University, Montreal, Canada. She is also the  director  of  the  SenseLab  (www.senselab.ca), a laboratory that explores  the  intersections  between art practice and philosophy through the matrix of the sensing body in movement.
