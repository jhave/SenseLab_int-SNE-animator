Brian Massumi: The traditional Left was really left behind by the culturalization or socialization of capital and the new functioning of the mass media. It seems to me that in the United States what’s left of the Left has become extremely isolated. So there is a sense of hope- lessness and isolation that ends up rigidifying people’s responses. They’re left to stew in their own righteous juices. They risk falling back on rectitude and right judgement, which simply is not affective. Or rather, it’s anti-affective affect – it’s curtailing, punishing, disciplin- ing. When this happens, it’s really just a sad holdover from the old regime – the dregs of disciplinary power. It seems to me that the Left has to relearn resistance, really taking to heart the changes that have happened recently in the way capitalism and power operate, and learning from the successes and failures of the anti- globalization movement.
