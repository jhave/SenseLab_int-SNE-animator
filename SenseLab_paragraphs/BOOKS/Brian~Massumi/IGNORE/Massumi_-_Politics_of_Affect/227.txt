collectivity, for its becoming. It is the embodied freedom of bodies to come together in thinking-feeling, to par- ticipate in differentially attuned becoming, in all imme- diacy and with all urgency.
The activities that Erin Manning and I co-organize through her philosophical laboratory, the SenseLab, attempt to experiment with improvisational techniques of relation from this transindividual perspective of event mechanics. Movement-events like the Arab Spring, Occupy, the Spanish indignados movements, and the 2012 student movement we in Quebec call the Maple Spring can be seen as collective embodiments of this kind of democracy in action.2 Anywhere representation is eschewed in favour of presentation, in the sense of affective tuning-in; anywhere the square or the street takes precedence over the party meeting; anywhere directly embodied participation takes the upper hand from the communication of opinion or the prescription of intended outcomes; anywhere decision is an emergent property of the coming-together, for becoming-together, of a differential human multiplicity, and not the edict of an individual leader or lead group backed by an exist- ing power structure of whatever stripe â€“ there, a direct democracy is being improvised. There, resistance is unfolding.
