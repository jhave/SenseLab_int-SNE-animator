consciously recognize what you’re afraid of, or even feel that it is yourself that is the subject of the feeling, you are catapulted into a feeling of the frightfulness of the situation. It only dawns on you in the next instant that you’d better figure out what might have done the cata- pulting, and what you should do about it. It is only then that you own the feeling as your own, and recognize it as a content of your life, an emotional episode in your personal history.

In fact, the thesis goes further, so far as to say that this bodily commotion is what an emotion is. James calls it emotion, but at the generative level it is what we’re calling affect.

The body figures here as a cut in the continuity of relation, filled with potential for re-relating, with a difference. Microperceptual shock is like a re-cueing of our bodily powers of existence. Here, the body is what Peirce calls
