a subject thinking or being towards the world, but the world reconstituting itself around an actively present germ of the past. There’s already, in that immeasurable instant of incipience, an activation of tendencies to- wards the future. The future has a kind of felt presence, an affective presence, as an attractor. Because each ten- dency tends towards a certain kind of outcome. It is attracted by its own end. That end point is what James calls a ‘terminus’. It’s a limit point governing the direc- tion of an unfolding. Again, that’s like a thought, if you can consider thinking an effective presence of what isn’t actually there. By being effectively present without actu- ally being there I don’t mean being consciously pro- jected on the future as a possibility. It’s a pulling of the present, already pregnant with pastness, out of itself, from within its own event. It’s a force of time acting immanently to the occurrence. It’s a real, generative factor of the forming moment. I call it a force because it has a certain kind of efficacy, a formative power. I like to call this formative participation of the future ‘quasi- causal’, because it is more like an attractor in chaos theory than an efficient material cause. Whitehead in- sists that the future is also always active in the ‘energiz- ing’ of the present by the past that inaugurates a coming event.
All that happens in the cut, in the instant of commo- tion, microshock, or welling event-suspense. It occurs on the microperceptual level, in an interval smaller than the smallest perceivable, to paraphrase Deleuze. It cannot be consciously perceived. What we perceive is what unfolds from that interpenetration of moments, as the coming event plays itself out. We perceive the trail- ing into the situation of the past already tending out of
