catastrophe. So one of the questions of the biogram is how the pragmatic field of potential crystallizes for each person, given the kinds of events we are living through together, how the different attunements occur across individual differences. Then the next question is: are there ways of tweaking these kinds of pragmatic pre- suppositions, crystallizing a field that creates a greater availability of certain alternative tendencies, more of the helping-hand variety? That would be a modulation of the biogram. Can this alter collective conditions in a lasting way? Can the modulations be gathered up, archived, reactivated? Can techniques be found to make them more creative? These are the kinds of problems weâ€™ve been working with in the SenseLab events, with an emphasis on this notion that there are creative tech- niques for the modulation of relational fields, and that it can help to think about them in diagrammatic, or biogrammatic, terms.
