Affect is feel-good.  This  idea  is  a  misunderstanding of the Spinozan concept of ‘joy’ that is often used in affect theory. Joy in the Spinozan sense refers to the intensity of the affective  encounter.  The  intensity of the encounter in turn refers to an augmentation in powers of existence – capacities  to  feel,  act and perceive – that occurs through the encounter. Understood in this way, joy is not synonymous with positive emotion. It is not ‘happy’, and it does not connote the attainment of satisfaction. These ‘hedonic’ distinctions simply do not apply to affect. They apply to emotions: the psychological capture of affect for the interiority of a supposedly individual subject. Subjects feel good about themselves emotionally (or not), in the personal refuge of their putative interiority. Affect feels out the world. It is by nature open to adventure, and adventures always involve hardship. Joy in adventure cannot be had without affirming the hardship, in the strong sense of taking it on creatively.
