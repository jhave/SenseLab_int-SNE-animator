Bodil Marie Stavning Thomsen*: Brian, we were reading your article in The Guardian about the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster, affective  politics  and the media.1 Catastrophe used to  be  talked  about  as the exceptional. But nowadays, we see, it’s ubiquitous. In your article you discuss the affective  power  of new  media  in  relation  to  globalization  and  the  risk society, relating it to catastrophes like Fukushima that reverberate everywhere, across all boundaries. In particular, the boundary between cultural production and natural forces is blurred today, it almost no longer applies, and our ability to act and how we are able to touch each other has been affected by the affective atmosphere of natural-cultural catastrophes, to the point where we have almost lost that ability. This sentence of the article caught our attention: ‘An ecological alter-politics must also be an alter-politics of affect.’
