So there are at least those three kinds of memory: a nonconscious memory of the present, which is the past actively contracted into the cut of the present instant (what I call the ‘here-and-now’ to differentiate it from the specious present that encompasses and unifies its fractal teeming and gives it the continuity of a duration); a memory of the past, which is a rear view of the past from the perspective of the consciously experienced specious present of lived duration; and a felt memory of the future, which is the quasi-causal force of tendency taking effect, governed recursively by the futurity of the terminus towards which it tends. All of these forms of memory can operate at the same time, and in our waking lives they usually do. They are complements of each other.
