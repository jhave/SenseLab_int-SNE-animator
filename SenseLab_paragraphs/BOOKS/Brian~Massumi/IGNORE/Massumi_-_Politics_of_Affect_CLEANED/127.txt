Brian Massumi: But what I was trying to say is that there is no such thing as autonomy and decisive control over one’s life in any total sense, whether you have a job or whether you don’t. There are different sets of constraints, and, like we were saying before, freedom always arises from constraint – it’s a creative conversion of it, not some utopian escape from it. Wherever you are, there is still potential, there are openings, and the openings are in the grey areas, in the blur where you’re susceptible to affective contagion, or capable of spreading it. It’s never totally within your personal power to decide.
