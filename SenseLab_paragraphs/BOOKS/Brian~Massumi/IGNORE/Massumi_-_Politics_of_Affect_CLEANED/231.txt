Intensity does not ‘have’ value. Intensity is a value, in itself. In fact, it is a surplus-value: a surplus-value of  life.  It  is  a  more  to  life,  in  life,  one  with  its improvisational thinking-feeling. This way of thinking about politics in terms of contrasts and lived intensities of feeling is unmistakeably aesthetic in tenor. Whitehead was one of the first philosophers to create an aestheticopolitics. I find many resonances between his aestheticopolitical approach and Félix Guattari’s ‘ethico-aesthetic paradigm’, in which I find much inspiration. The concept of the integral mutual inclusion of contrasts in a shared dynamic field is close to the notion of ‘differential attunement’ I was using earlier. Whitehead’s proposition to make a fundamental value of the mutual inclusion of differences makes the invaluable point that the goal of politics need not be the overcoming of differences, or even their reconciling. Instead, the goal can be their rendering compossible, as different, with all the intensity that can be had in their eventful in-between.
