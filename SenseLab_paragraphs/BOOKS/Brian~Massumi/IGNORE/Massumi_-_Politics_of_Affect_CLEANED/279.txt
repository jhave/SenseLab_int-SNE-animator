So the parent takes the child to a therapist or doctor, and the doctor begins to test the child. When the autistic child won’t make eye contact, won’t play etc., won’t identify as such in relation to the doctor, the doctor says ‘your child is unempathetic, unrelational, and really it’s a cross to bear; I’m very sorry but you are facing a life-time of non-communication with your child’. Tito talks about his experience of this event, challenging the identity politics engrained in it and emphasizing another kind of encounter, one that is profoundly ecological and nonhuman-centred – he writes of going into the doctor’s office and recalls the magical way the light reflected on the mirror and the way the mirror reflected back on the wall. He talks about how the curtains interacted with the light and how the door reflected it and how all this affected his relationship to the room and the room’s relationship to him. And he writes that yes, the doctor did ask him to play with some toys on the table – but they weren’t as interesting as the movements of the light so he chose not to play with them, or perhaps didn’t really even acknowledge the doctor’s request or the others in the room. Why would he? The movements of light were much more interesting. When at the end of that meeting the doctor told his mother that he was autistic Tito assumed not that he had a disability – what was disabling about this wonderful game of perception he had been playing? – but that all the non-speaking moving things in his life were in fact also autistic – the curtains, the fan. What great company!
