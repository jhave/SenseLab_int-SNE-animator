Erin Manning: Perhaps the form of language we resist the most is debate and general positioning without enacting concepts or bringing them into play. This is why we work so closely with philosophical texts in the process of event-planning. Our hope is to get away from general  statements  such  as  â€˜of  course,  as  everyone instead in ways singularly connected to the work we are engaged with. In the five hours we spent with Madeline that day, all of that time was used to engage with language at the level of the work we have to do and not at the level of positioning ourselves or of debate.
