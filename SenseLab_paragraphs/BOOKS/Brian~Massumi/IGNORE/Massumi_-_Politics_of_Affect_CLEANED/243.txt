This is closer to the anarchist notion of ‘propaganda by the deed’ than it is to traditional Marxist notions of ideology critique and vanguard action. Over the last two years, we have seen this kind of exemplary politics percolating up in many places around the world. The Occupy movement’s refusal to advance a particular set of demands is a case in point. This refusal to set forth a programme was not a deficiency, it was an enablement. It was a way of saying that what was important was the gathering together of bodies and capacities in self-improvising collective movement for the production of surplus-value of life, and that democracy is that far-from-equilibrium movement – not its pre-programmed end in a prefigured stable structure. This is the ‘direct’, relational democracy of enactive resistance.
