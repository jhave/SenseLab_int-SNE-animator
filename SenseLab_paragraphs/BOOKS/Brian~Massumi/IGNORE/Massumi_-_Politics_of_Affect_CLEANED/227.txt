Politically, this changes the whole framework. Affective techniques of thinking-feeling improvisationally are relational techniques that apply to situations more directly than to persons. They are directly collective. They are fundamentally participatory, since they are activated in situation, couched singularly in the occurrence of that encounter. They are event-factors, not intentions. My proposition is that there are relational techniques that can be practised to modulate unfolding events in a way that takes off from the primary capacity of resistance implied in a Spinozist concept of affect, and have the potential of reorienting tendencies towards different ends, without predesignating exactly what they are. This avoids the ideological trap of ending up reimposing much the same kind of power structure that is being resisted. Tendencies are oriented, but open-ended. An in-situation, on-the-fly modulation can be complexly co-inflected by any number of bodies, so that the integral of the differences in play that is what all those involved become in differential attunement to the same event will always be an irreducibly collective product. It is a collective self-structuring. This is a politics beyond self-interest, but not in any ‘general’ interest. It is in the interests of the collectively unfolding event.
