continually return to it, fold themselves back into it, to come back out through it. This is because, as I said earlier about ‘society’, higher-order structurations are emergent. As they emerge, they settle into ‘apparatuses of capture’. By ‘settled’ I mean that they contrive to re-emerge. As they do so, they capture affective tendencies originating in the open field of embodied collective attunement, and feed off of them, feed them into their own perpetuation. Structures of oppression are regularities of capture. Prior to capture, in their first stirrings in the existential field of bare activity, the movements a structure feeds off of belong to a different order from the one they are structured into. They belong  to  an order of incipiency of a very different texture. Structures of power are powered by these different-order movements that they capture. They are parasitic. Vampiric. They emerge, self-structuring, surfing the crest of outside energies, and can only perpetuate themselves by diving in and catching the wave again. They have no motive force of their own.
