others take up your gift of potential, they take it places you couldn’t have taken it by yourself – which then enables you to go places you couldn’t have gone alone. When an event of this kind is working, a dancer might move into a philosophical text in a way they never thought they had the preparation to do. And a philosopher might find themselves translating concepts into movements. When things like that happen, it deserves to be called an event. Events are always transindividual, bringing out potentials that could never have been arrived at individually.
