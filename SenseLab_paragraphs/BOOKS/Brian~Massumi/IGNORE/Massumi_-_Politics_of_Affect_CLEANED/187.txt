Erin and I are both professors, so the university is the day-to-day situation we start from, or more precisely the academic institution including its extended milieu of publishing, workshopping and conferencing. Erin is also in a fine arts department, so we operate between the art and academic institutions. In both cases there’s an imperative to produce and create what is increasingly being called, importing corporate vocabulary, a ‘deliverable’ – a valorizable product, like a gallery-ready artwork or an article publishable in a standardized (‘peer-reviewed’) disciplinary journal. The emphasis is on packageable content for transmission. Increasingly, in this environment process itself becomes product, as when creative platforms developed by artists are seen as research contributions feeding product development for the ‘culture industries’. Intellectual property is the new creativity. There are very strong pressures in this direction in Canada and elsewhere, where art has become ‘research’ (‘research-creation’ is what we call it in Canada), subject like all academic activity to productivity assessment. We wanted to see how far we could go, within the art and academic institutions, towards freeing creative and collaborative process from this tendency, while still continuing to survive within that environment, which for better or for worse is the one that feeds us – we can’t deny our participation in it and our dependence on it – and which is overall is not going to change any time soon.
