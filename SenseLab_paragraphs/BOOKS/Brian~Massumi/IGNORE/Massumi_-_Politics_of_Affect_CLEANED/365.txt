All three dimensions enter into every event. It is the last aspect, the reality of the virtual, that finally characterizes the event, that expresses what it will have all been about. It’s the pop-out effect that says, to use the same example again, ‘this is a triangular event’. When you move to more complicated events, you have to find correspondingly complex ways of talking about the untimeliness of the virtual realities that characterize events. Platonic forms are just the simplest, most limited case. Without going into details now, in my talk last night I introduced a renewed concept of ‘value’ to talk about  this.
