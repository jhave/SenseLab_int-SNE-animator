Brian Massumi: Well, if you think of your life as an autonomous collectivity or a connective autonomy,  it still makes sense to think in terms of self-interest at a certain level. Obviously a disadvantaged group has to assess its interests and fight for certain rights, certain rights of passage and access, certain resources – often survival itself is in the balance. But at the same time, if any group, disadvantaged or otherwise, identifies itself completely with its self-interests it’s living the fiction that it is a separate autonomy. It is missing the potential that comes from taking the risk of making an event of the way you relate to other people, orienting it towards becoming-other. So in a way you are cutting yourself off from your own potential to change and intensify your life. If you think of it in terms of potential and intensified experience then too much self-interest is against your own interests. You have to constantly be balancing those two levels.  Political  actions  that  only  operate in terms of the self-interest of identified groups occupying recognizable social categories like male/female, unemployed/employed, have limited usefulness. For me, if they are pursued to the exclusion of other forms of political activity they end up creating a sort of rigidity – a hardening of the arteries!
