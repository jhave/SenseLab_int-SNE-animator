Joel McKim: There are two things in your description that stand out to me as being very useful additions to the version of Spinoza’s affect that is often referred to, usually via Deleuze. One is this immediately intersubjective element that seems to bring back into the picture Spinoza’s idea of ‘common notions’ – agreements between bodies that allow the power of the individual body to be enhanced through the forming of relations. The other interesting addition you make is to include a notion of memory. You suggest that an affective experience, or the feeling of the transition from one power of existence to another, can somehow be reactivated in different series, in different relations. When you say that this memory is housed in the body, you’re not necessarily speaking about an individual body, you’re speaking about bodies of relations, of complexes. What happens when we move into a new set of relations? Do we start from scratch or can we bring that  affective  memory with us?
