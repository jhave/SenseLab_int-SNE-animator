Christoph Brunner: That’s an interesting point. I have been re-reading Simondon recently, and Muriel Combes’s book on his work. Both address the question of anxiety. It seems to me that at the core the question of anxiety concerns different modes of resonance, and what you can create through the openness of a situation. On the one hand, this requires us to think about what means and techniques there are to become a catalyst and to benefit from surfing that wave, as Deleuze would say. On the other hand, it makes us think about the moment of impasse where everything seems to be locked and gridded. As Simondon says, that’s the moment of anxiety and death. This leads me to think about the process of bifurcation in a life-practice – what kinds of techniques can be used for nurturing, and where you go from there. Thinking about the practices of research-creation we have been working on for a while at the SenseLab – investigating how to work, act, think, write and move in the immediacy of an event, and how to create something from there that comes into its own, singularizing and resonating-with, so as to renew the event. As part of this investigation, we ask what kinds of metastable fields can be constituted. How do we create dense fields that modulate in a way that is all their own? However, some of these fields and modulations generate more lures, open up more potential, for subsequent take-up in different contexts than others do.
