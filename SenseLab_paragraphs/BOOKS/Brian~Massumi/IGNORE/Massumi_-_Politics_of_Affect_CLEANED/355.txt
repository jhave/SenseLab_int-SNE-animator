The tendency towards ontogenesis cannot operate without the contrasting tendency towards homeostasis. Life can’t always live at the limit. It can’t continue to survive if it is always pushing to the limit of intensity, creating new forms. It needs a degree of stability, oases of rest. It cannot be chaotically far-from-equilibrium at all times. It has to find its footing, to brace itself for new becomings. This means that life is the movement between the mental and physical poles, between conformation and supernormal excess, between one event and another, between all of the various factors in play. Life lives in the gaps. Still, what I just called the supernormal tendency, corresponding to the mental pole, is the dominant tendency. Life is biased in its direction – otherwise it would not be so changeable. We wouldn’t have the exuberant proliferation of forms that we see in nature and in culture.
