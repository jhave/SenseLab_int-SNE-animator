Brian Massumi: Well, I think that the kinds of contact we were used to having and that we experience as live and interpersonal have become dispersed. I don’t think they’ve been replaced by a disconnect, but by a different kind of contact that is just as affectively charged. And yes, it’s clear that crisis and catastrophe are no longer exceptional, they’re the normal situation, as Benjamin famously said. The complexity of the interlocking systems we live in, on the social, cultural, economic and natural levels, is now felt in all its complexity, because we’re reaching certain tipping points, for example in relation to climate change and refugee flows. There is a sense that we’re in a far-from-equilibrium situation where each of the systems we have depended upon for stability is perpetually on the verge  of  tipping  over into crisis, with the danger that there will be a sort of cascade of effects through adjoining systems, like a domino effect. It’s a very unstable, quasi-chaotic situation. And there’s no vantage point from which to understand it from the outside. We’re immersed in it. We’re absorbed in the imminence of catastrophe, always braced for it – which means it has become immanent to our field of life. That imminence-immanence is a mode of contact, of direct affective proximity, even if it occurs ‘at a distance’ through the action of the media or, more to the point, within an increasingly integrated media ecology.
