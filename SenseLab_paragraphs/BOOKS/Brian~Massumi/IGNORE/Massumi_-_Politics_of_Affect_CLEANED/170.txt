For the question of whether the qualitative change registering in affective tonality is transportable, the answer would have to be no, not strictly speaking. All the things we have talked about are generative factors of an event. Affect is one creative factor entering into the constitution of events, even if it is a very special one. It is not a content that can be transported from one event to another. Like all event-factors, it can be repeated, reactivated, it can rearise, but always anew. The logic of affect is entirely bound up with the logic of serial repetition and difference that applies to events. Itâ€™s an event-logic, not a logic of transmission or communication.
