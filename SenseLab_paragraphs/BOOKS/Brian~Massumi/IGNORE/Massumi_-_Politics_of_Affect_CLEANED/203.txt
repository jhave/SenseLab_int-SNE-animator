Brian Massumi:To speak of a post-ideological society is to posit implicitly that society was effectively structured by ideology previously. This focuses the discussion on a negative claim: that a rupture has occurred. To support that claim, the received description of what one is claiming has been left must be taken as a starting point. The entire discussion remains framed in terms of the concept it is calling into question. Deleuze and Guattari do not refer to society after ideology. They make a much more radical claim: ‘There is no ideology, and there never was.’ This is not the conclusion of their argument, but the beginning. What they are saying with this provocation is that the entire problem must be reframed, from start to finish. The conceptual strands that were bound together into the notion of ideology must be untied, and their connection to each other reproblematized. In the process, the presuppositions informing that construction must be re-examined.
