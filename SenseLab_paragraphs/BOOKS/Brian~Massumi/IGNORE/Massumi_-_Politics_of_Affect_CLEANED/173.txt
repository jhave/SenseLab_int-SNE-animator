The opposite can also happen. Habit can rebecome a creative force for the acquisition of new propensities, because it makes capacities available for  enaction, and something can vary in the course of that makingavailable, and then be  added  to  a  body’s  repertory. To mobilize habit in this rebecoming way, the body, as you say, has to become sensitive to what’s coming. It has to feel the priming, as a formative force, before it bears fruit. Perversely, this is a kind of pre-emptive power. It is a pre-emptive power that is creative of a moreness to life, what I call an ontopower. I say it’s perverse because I am convinced that it is the same power mobilized by the contemporary military machine. In some of the most affectand perception-savvy recent texts in military theory, they call this rebecomingcreative of habit ‘non-recognition-based priming’ and ‘sampling  the  future’.  It’s  part  of  a  colonization  of the mico-perceptual by the war-machine that deserves serious study.
