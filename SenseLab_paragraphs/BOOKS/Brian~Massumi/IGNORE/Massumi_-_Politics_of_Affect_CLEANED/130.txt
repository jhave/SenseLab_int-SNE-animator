socially classified – whether you are male or female, child or adult, rich or poor, employed or unemployed but none of those conditions or definitions are boxes that completely contain a person’s potential. And having pity for someone who occupies a category that is not socially valorized, or expressing moral outrage on their behalf, is not necessarily what is helpful in the long run, because it maintains the category and simply inverts its value sign, from negative to positive. It’s a kind of piety, a moralizing approach. It’s not affectively pragmatic. It doesn’t challenge identity-based divisions.
