An existential value is a surplus-value of life, in the sense that it carries a force of extra-being, of becoming. A surplus-value of life is always collective, but not in a sense of a simple aggregation of individuals as countable elements of a set. It is collective in that truly transindividual sense in which things come into supernumerary relation with each other through the potentials they activate, and surpass themselves in a joint movement constituting the dynamic unity of their differential. The collective is not just an aggregate of individuals. It is a co-individuation. For that reason, Simondon always uses the term collective individuation.
