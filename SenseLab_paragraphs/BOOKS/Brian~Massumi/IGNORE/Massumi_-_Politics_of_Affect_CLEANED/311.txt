Christoph Brunner: Brian, this leads me to your exposition of bare activity and Erin’s notion of the in-act. In thinking about the question of activity or the act, there is a tendency to assume that they are only concerned with emergence. But there is also Whitehead’s concept of ‘perishing’, which you both take up in your work. I was  wondering  how  can  we  think  in  three  kinds  of tonalities of activity: as bare activity, a worlding and force of life, continuation and renewing; then the act of formation of subjectivity and the kinds of inflections you can try to seek out, insert and inflect; and finally what Judith Butler calls ‘supported action’, underlining how there is a kind of material grounding of the vitalism of the body that needs to be sustained and supported. This last idea refers to the fact that new events are grounded in what past events that have ‘perished’ leave in the world for renewal. Some people might think that the politics, ethics and aesthetics of emergence have overemphasized one end of the continuum, whereas we also need to include an ethics and aesthetics of perishing.
