From this perspective, the question is then what happens in the field, in all immediacy? It seems to me that rather than personally positioning each individual, it braces them into a kind of  differential  attunement with others. We’re all in on the event together, but we’re in it together differently. We each come with a different set of tendencies, habits and action potentials. That’s what I mean by differential attunement: a collective in-bracing in the immediacy of an affective event, but differently in each case. ‘Attunement’ refers to the direct capture of attention and energies by the event. ‘Differential’ refers to the fact that we each are taken into the event from a different angle, and move out of it following our own singular trajectories, riding the waves in our own inimitable way. It’s the idea of an event snapping us to attention together, and correlating our diversity to the affective charge this brings, energizing the whole situation. And it’s the idea that this happens at a level where direct bodily reactions and our ability to think are so directly bound up with each other that they can’t be separated out yet from each other, or from the energizing of the event.
