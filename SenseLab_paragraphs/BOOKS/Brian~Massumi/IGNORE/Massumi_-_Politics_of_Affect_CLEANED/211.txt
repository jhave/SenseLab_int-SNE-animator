It is as much for these practical reasons as for philosophical reasons that Deleuze and Guattari launch the rallying cry, ‘there is no ideology and there never was’. Philosophically, the call is for a reframing of the problem in a way that strives to answer questions such as these: think of society as a structure?  Is  it  not  more  useful  to  think  of  it  as  a process? A process is dynamic and open-ended, composed of ongoing variations on itself. It fundamentally lacks the groundedness of a structure. Any stabilizing structuring is emergent, and self-improvised. This makes variation and change more fundamental than the reproduction of the same. The question is inverted.
