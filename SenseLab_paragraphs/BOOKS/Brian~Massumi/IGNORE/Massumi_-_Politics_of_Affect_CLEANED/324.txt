Erin Manning: In that beautiful passage you and Brian were mentioning, Simondon also talks about solitude. He does this as part of an urgent call not to talk about tendencies like anxiety and even solitude in a way that reindividualizes them. They need to be thought of in the context of individuation, or the relational becoming of the individual. Reindividualizing is a temptation we have seen a lot these days. To bring anxiety, depression, panic back to the level of the individual. I think the work of Bifo is really exemplary in that way. I have recently been reading Bifo trying to understand the necessity and the urgency that he seems to feel in creating what I consider a repersonalizing account of experience that too often reindividualizes the question of anxiety. This reindividualization, which perhaps affects me most in the way Bifo combines his theory of the act with depression in his account of Guattari’s so-called ‘winter years’, builds on his relation of friendship in ways that make me very uncomfortable. In his account of Guattari, if I am very reductive, what we end up with is something like: ‘I knew Guattari to have been depressed and therefore you must read Guattari’s work as an activist, as a therapist, as a philosopher, in light of his depression.’ This counters the in-act of Guattari’s schizoanalytic practice – including his writing – in a fundamental way, it seems to me. Everything in Guattari, in my opinion, follows the lines of what Brian was just saying, working hard to understand the relationship between the preindividual, the transindividual and the group-subject. The question for Guattari is never reducible to the subject-position: it is always about creating and grasping new forms of subjectivity that emerge from the event. I have no doubt Guattari was depressed – but construing depression as counteracting the in-act simply makes no sense to me.
