What we have found in our collective SenseLab network as we work through the relationship between philosophy, art and activism is that techniques have to be generated in the event, each occasion anew, because if they are not, they simply don’t work. That’s the pragmatic side or as we call it the speculative pragmatic side. The event generates its own forms of speculation and forms of pragmatism, and you have to be in the event to compose with them. This is a relational task at the level of the field itself. If you think of yourself as the subject of the event, you’ll fail simply because you will have taken yourself out of all of those complex relational tendencies of the event to generate its own potential. What is at stake here is understanding not the agency of the subject, but the agencement of the event in its speculatively pragmatic unfolding. This is a word that is impossible to translate. The best that anyone’s come up with is ‘assemblage’, but that’s misleading. Agencement connotes a doing doing itself. You have to understand the event itself as agency-ing.
