That society is a structure is just one of the presuppositions involved. There is a series of further presuppositions associated with it. There is the assumption that affect, or feeling, is individual. Also, that affect is the opposite of rational, that it is simply the irrational. It further assumes that if individuals were not affectively misled for ideological purposes, they would have the possibility of overcoming their own irrationality, in order to begin to act in accordance with their true interests. This contains the very traditional – and, one might add, thoroughly ‘bourgeois’ – assumption that self-interest is the primary motivating force, and that to act according to one’s interests is to act rationally. It is precisely because this presupposition is lurking in the background that the critique of the dominant ideology must concern itself with the construction of the ‘new man’ (or whatever equivalent term is used). This is a collective project to make the general interest a reality. Individuals’ ways of feeling and acting must recompose into a new rationality that abolishes the distance between individual and collective interest. Structure of feeling must be made to coincide with a new social coherence. Affect must be made to consciously coincide with the structure of ideas reflecting that coherence. The individual must come to affectively embody the collective structure, and live it in the everyday.
