Affect is good. Affect is ethically neutral, in the normal understanding of ethics. That is why it must have its own ethics. As such, affect is neither good nor bad by prevailing ethical criteria. The ethics of affect has no normative value. Affect concerns the revaluation of values. It acknowledges norms only to exceed them, in becoming (including the becoming of the system of norms). This revaluation is desired. Or it is not. Affect is not prescriptive. It is promissory. What it promises is intensity. It is neutral as well in relation to political criteria of judgement. Affect can be fascistic or progressive; reactionary or revolutionary. It all depends on the orientation of the transindividual desires speculatively gestured into motion. The evaluation of affect bears on these tendential orientations. That evaluation has no power of prescription. It is not a judgement that can justify an orientation. It is a diagnosis that maps the promise of an encounter. The diagnosis is an eventful dimension of the speculative gesture. It is included in the enactment. The ethics of affect is therefore experimental. It operates on the level of enactive technique, and like all technique is honed through trial and error. Given the transindividual nature  of  affect, the techniques must be effectively, if speculatively, collective.
