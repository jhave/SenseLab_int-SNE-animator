Brian Massumi: It seems to me that alternative political action does not have to fight against the idea that power has become affective, but rather has to learn to function itself on that same level – meet affective modulation with affective modulation. That requires, in some ways, a performative, theatrical or aesthetic approach to politics. For example, it is not possible for a dispossessed group to adequately communicate its  needs and desires through the usual channels. It just doesn’t happen. It wasn’t possible for marginal interest groups like the anti-globalization movement before the Seattle demonstration (1999) to do that simply by arguing convincingly and broadcasting its message. The message doesn’t get through, because the  public  discourse doesn’t function on that level of the rational weighing of choices. Unfortunately the kind of theatrical or performative intervention that  is the  easiest and  has the most immediate effect is often a violent kind. If windows hadn’t been broken and cars hadn’t been overturned in Seattle, most people wouldn’t have heard of the antiglobalization movement by now. That outburst of anger actually helped create networks of people working around  the  world  trying  to  address  the  increasing inequalities that accompany globalization. It was able to shake the situation enough that people took notice. It was like everything was thrown up in the air for a moment and people came down after the shock in a slightly different order and some were interconnected in ways that they hadn’t been before. Dispossessed people like the Palestinians or the people in Irian Jaya just can’t argue their cases effectively through the media, which is why they’re sometimes driven to violent guerrilla tactics or terrorism, out of desperation.
