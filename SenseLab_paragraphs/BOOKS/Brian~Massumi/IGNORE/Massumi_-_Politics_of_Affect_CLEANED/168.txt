the present. Then there’s another kind of memory, a Kierkegaardian memory. Kierkegaard talks about how we ‘remember forwards, but recall backwards’. Recalling backwards is conscious remembering. Remembering forwards is the feeling of the attractor, the end point or terminus, making itself felt as the limit point of a tendency contracted in the past, and now reactivated. The attractor is a futurity, but it’s memory-like in that it only has futurity by virtue of contracting pastness. It pulls a contracted past through the crucible of the present, towards itself, the not-yet of this event. I think this idea of the terminus can be linked to what Whitehead calls an ‘eternal object’ (a misnomer if there ever was one, because it isn’t an object but a potential, and it isn’t eternal in the sense of enduring through time, but rather in the sense that it enters actively into the constitution of every moment).
