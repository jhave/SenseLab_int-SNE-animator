Mary Zournazi: Yes, and there is a relation between this ethics, hope and the idea of joy. If we take Spinoza and Nietzsche seriously, an ethic of joy and the cultivation of joy are an affirmation of life. In the sense of what you are saying, even a small thing can become amplified and can have a global effect, which is life-affirming. What are your thoughts on this ethical relationship in everyday existence? And in intellectual practice – which is where we are coming from – what are the affirmations of joy and hope?
