Whitehead’s book The Function of Reason is very interesting in relation to activity and life.1 The question that Whitehead raises in it is the question of the quality of life. He asks, what is it that can account for the fact that we strive to live well rather than simply living? This question is not strictly directed to the human, but to the way appetition functions in the ecology of practices of which humans are but one aspect. Creativity is at the heart of Whitehead’s analysis. For Whitehead, one of the ways ecologies evolve towards complexity is through their appetition for the more-than of experience: they have a concern for how the doing happens, how the something-doing connects to other something-doings to generate modes of existence that are novel. Whitehead’s concept of the novel is not the capitalist concept that emphasizes the importance of the ‘newest new’. Creativity here refers to the generation of new forms of value that give rise to new forms of life. This is an account of valuation in the Nietzschean sense: it challenges the notion of evaluation according to external criteria with the idea that how an event comes into itself is a mode of valuation in itself. Any actual occasion for Whitehead is a mode of valuation: the question is, how does the event value its own mode of existence, how does it enjoy its own existence?
