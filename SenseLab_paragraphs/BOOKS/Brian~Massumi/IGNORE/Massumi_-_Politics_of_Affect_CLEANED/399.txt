Affect is anything goes. Affect is always conditioned. Its expression, as it comes to be enacted, is always selective. Every situation of encounter imposes constraints on the selection of potential that will eventuate. The expression of affect, far from being anything goes, is an expression of necessity. It is just that it is always also an expression of the necessity of invention: an ongoing validation of the rule of variation: that the world is restless at heart and never sits still. An inventive variation takes constraints as enabling. There would be no creativity  of  dance  without the constraint of  gravity.  Affect  assumes  necessity, in the strong sense of taking it on. It takes it on in such a way as to extract from it a surplus-value of creativity.
