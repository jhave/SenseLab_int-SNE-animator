Mary Zournazi: For me the relationship you were discussing earlier, between hope and fear in the political domain, is what gets mobilized by the Left and Right. In some ways the problem of more leftist or radical thinking is that it doesn’t actually tap into those mobilizations of different kinds of affects, whether it be hope, fear, love or whatever. The Left are criticizing the Right and the Right are mobilizing hope and fear in more affective ways. The Right can capture the imagination of a population and produce nationalist feelings and tendencies, so there can be a real absence of hope to counter what’s going on in everyday life, and I think the Left have a few more hurdles to jump. . .
