Erin Manning: Yes, a force for life that extends beyond this human life to the life of organic–inorganic ecologies or speciations – a different way of conceiving of life. I often come at this through Deleuze’s last article, ‘Immanence: A Life’,10 which, it seems to me, gives us profound tools for beginning to think life-living not in terms of ‘this life’ but as a project for a ‘life’ differently conceived, life as an ecology of practices that continuously interfolds the inorganic with the organic, the human and the nonhuman, shaping experience in the making.
