In any case, it’s an ongoing project. We are in the midst – as always – and things will only begin to become clear as we continue to experiment collectively and participatorily, on the conceptual level in our writing and thinking, and afield experimentally, in thinking-feeling gestures of invitation to collective movement, on the street and in the institutions framing our daily activities. Like the field of resistance, the clarification is to come, flush with our exemplary events. To be invented . . . If faith in affect is misplaced, as Deleuze often said, ‘belief in the world’ is not. It’s all we have: the participatory trust that the world always already offers degrees of freedom ready for amplification.
