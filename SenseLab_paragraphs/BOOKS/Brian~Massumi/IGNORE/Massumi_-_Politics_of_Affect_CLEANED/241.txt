There is only one a priori: participation, participatory immersion in bare activity. Resistance comes of immanence. It cannot be led. If it is, it is already coagulating into an apparatus of capture poised to rise up and bear down, as if from above and outside. Resistance is immanent critique: a ‘critique’ that is one with its enaction. It occurs at the level on which bodies think more actively and feel more thinkingly, towards acting differently together. In this kind of resistance, there is no avantgarde. There are seeds. Seeds of free action blowing in the winds of bare activity, looking for a fertile field of attunement for their flowering. The analogy is inexact. Such a field does not exist. In its role as exemplary gesture, resistance creates its own field. It gestures it into existence, by its own power of contagion. Resistance is performative of itself. It triggers its own selforganizing. Its field is always to come, flush with its own self-amplifying event.
