Society becomes an open field composed of thresholds or gateways, it becomes a continuous space of passage. It’s no longer rigidly structured by walled-in enclosures, there’s all kinds of latitude. It’s just that at key points along the way, at key thresholds, power is tripped into action. The exercise of the power bears on your movement – not so much you as a person. In the old disciplinary power formations, it was always about judging what sort of person you were, and the way power functioned was to make you fit a model, or else. If you weren’t the model citizen, you were judged guilty and locked up as a candidate for ‘reform’. That kind of power deals with big unities – the person as moral subject, right and wrong, social order. And everything was internalized – if you didn’t think right you were in trouble. Now you’re checked in passing, and instead of being judged innocent or guilty you’re registered as liquid. The process is largely automatic, and it doesn’t really matter what you think or who you are deep down. Machines do the detecting and ‘judging’. The check just bears on a little detail – do you have enough in your bank account, do you not have a gun? It’s a highly localized, partial exercise of power – a micropower. That micropower, though, feeds up to higher levels, bottom up.
