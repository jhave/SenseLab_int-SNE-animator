The September 11 terrorists made Bush president, they created President Bush, they fed the massive military and surveillance machine he’s now able to build. Before Bin Laden and al-Qaeda, Bush wasn’t a president, he was an embarrassment. Bin Laden and Bush are affective partners, like Bush Senior and Saddam Hussein, or Reagan and the Soviet leaders. In a way, they’re in collusion or in symbiosis. They’re like evil twins who feed off of each other’s affective energies. It’s a kind of vampiric politics. Everything starts happening between these opposite personifications of affect, leaving no room for other kinds of action. It’s rare that protest  violence  has  the  kind  of  positive  organizing power it did in Seattle. The anti-globalization movement had already lost that power by the time it reached Genoa (2001), when people started to die. The violence was overused by certain elements of the movement and under-strategized – it got predictable, it became a refrain, it lost its power.
