On the question of effectiveness. When we talk about effectiveness, we’re usually thinking about what philosophers call efficient causality. It’s the idea that an effect is directly proportionate to its cause, that the cause  can  be  isolated  from  background   activity, and then connected in linear fashion to its effect. It’s basically  the  billiard-ball  model,  where  the  future  is completely determined by a measurable force that is transmitted from the past through a part-to-part connection, in a localized impact. It’s the model of work again, but in the physics sense of the term. And this kind of causality, precisely, corresponds to Whitehead’s physical pole (which is not, however, reducible just to that). The mental pole is also effective – in introducing novelty. This complicates things, because when novelty happens, the unfolding of the event has not been linear. It has been inflected. Where does the nonlinearity come from? It comes from what is not completely determined in the field of relations. It comes from the background activity conditioning the event’s emergence. It comes from the complexity of relations, from interference and resonance effects between the formative factors  entering into play. There is always a margin of play in an event due to the complexity. This happens directly on the relational level, not part-to-part. It’s not closed or linear enough to be called causality. ‘Conditioning’ has to be distinguished as a mode of effectiveness in its own right, as distinct from causality. Both modes of effectiveness, of course, are active in every event, and a large part of what makes for the singularity of an event is how they shake down in relation to each other.
