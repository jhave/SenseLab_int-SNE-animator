We are at a moment where collective action feels urgent to many of us. I don’t know if we are at a moment that is less anxious or more anxious than other moments. What I do know is that an account of anxiety or depression has to be able to compose with the in-act in the way we are theorizing it here for it to align to a Guattarian way of thinking. The question of pathology and the therapeutic, when it comes up, has to be aligned to a Simondonian account of anxiety or solitude if we want to open it up beyond its reindividualizing tendencies. If this happens, the question of how the act produces new modes of existence will come up, and this will open up the exploration of neurodiversity in relation to the transindividual or the group-subject, as opposed to what Guattari, following Jean Oury, calls ‘normopathy’.
