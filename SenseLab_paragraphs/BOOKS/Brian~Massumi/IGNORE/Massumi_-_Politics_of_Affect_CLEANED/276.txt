I say this knowing that all speciations do culminate to some degree in species or categories. The point is not that there is no identity – no human, no animal, no plant
but that the species is not where the process begins or ends. Our proposition is not to negate species or identity, but to become aware that the force of speciation, of collective individuation, happens in the interstices where the ecologies are still in active transformation. In my own terms I would say that what is made possible by this approach is an opportunity for a kind of choreographic thinking which I define not as the imposition of a choreographic score, but as the creation of tools that enable the mobile diagram of speciations to come to the fore – a kind of incipient diagrammatic praxis.
