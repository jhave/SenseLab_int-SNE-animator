Brian Massumi: Going back to the notion of activity, for us it’s not about  instrumental  activity.  We’re not talking about work, activity as it is captured and organized by the capitalist system. The activations and reactivations we’re talking about happen at a very different level. It’s simply the idea that whenever something comes visibly or palpably to expression, it is emerging not out of nowhere, and not out of the structure of the past as fully determining, but out of a background activity that is inheriting from  the  past  but also creating the conditions for what will come next that will supersede the past and perhaps change the nature of what comes of it. Activity is not grounded in substance or in essence. It’s grounded in prior activity, taking a new twist. That’s the  basic  tenet  of  what  I call ‘activist philosophy’, which I see as a complement to an immediations approach. Every time there is a thought, there has already been activity in the body. Every time there has been activity in the body, there has been activity in the environment. There are interlinkings of different levels of activity channelled into certain points of  more  or  less  clear  expression.  It  is at the points of more or less clear expression that activity in this primary sense can be captured by apparatuses like those of capitalism, and converted into work. It is also at those points of clear expression that emergence is coming to the end of its arc. The movement of expression is culminating. The event ‘perishes’. The potentials  it  carried  to  expression  are  then ready for reactivation, either as conditions for a new emergence, or as captured potentials feeding a selfperpetuating structure that has found ways of reactivating itself across the perishings of events. Emergence and perishing are not opposites. They are pulses or phases in a process. An emergence lives on its own becoming. As soon as it expands its potential for that becoming, it perishes.
