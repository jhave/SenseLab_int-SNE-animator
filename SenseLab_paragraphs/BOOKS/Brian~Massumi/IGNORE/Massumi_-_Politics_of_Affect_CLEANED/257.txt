I use the model of the event to talk about what has been traditionally analysed in terms of mediation and transmission. What Iâ€™m talking about is more an immediate in-bracing than a mediation in the traditional  sense. This in-bracing has more to do with complex field effects, and their wave-like amplification and propagation, than with point-to-point transmissions.
