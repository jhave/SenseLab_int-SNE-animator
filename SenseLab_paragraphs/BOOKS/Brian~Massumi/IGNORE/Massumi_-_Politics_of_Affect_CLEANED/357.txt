Brian Massumi: To stay for a moment with the question of life, I would say that a life is not an in-itself, it’s an outdoing-itself. In other words, it follows a tendency to exceed already-realized potential in an actualization of new potential. That process, as you said, is relational. In order to think relation as primary, we need a different kind of logic, because the traditional logic is one of separation. Traditionally, the basic logical gesture is to separate X from  not-X, and  then define the  common characteristics justifying  inclusion  of a  given  case  in the set of X’s. It starts with exclusion and ends in sameness. That doesn’t get you to a process of outdoingitself. It gets you to a stable structure of thought that cannot move. If you try to undo that logic, you have to accept that you cannot operate with the principle of the excluded middle – X or not-X. But you also have to go beyond deconstructing that exclusionary logic. You have to go on to affirm a more encompassing logic that is able to deal with what I call ‘mutual inclusion’. When you get to that territory, you find that it’s mined with paradoxes that you cannot avoid. You have to figure out how to make them productive. In that logic there are more terms than X and non-X, because of the included middle.
