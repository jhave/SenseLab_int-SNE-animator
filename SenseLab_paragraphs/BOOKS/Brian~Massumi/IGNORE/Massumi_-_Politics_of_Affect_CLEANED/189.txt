in a dormitory room? Without constraints there are no stakes.
Our point of departure is what we call ‘enabling constraints’ – sets of designed constraints that are meant to create specific conditions for creative interaction where something is set to happen, but there is no preconceived notion of exactly what the outcome will be or should be. No deliverable. All process. We started practising what we thought of as event design, design for alternative-format art-academic events. The stakes aren’t defined so much by issues or content or definable outcome. The stakes are the event happening or not, seeing what can be done to open up new ground for exploration and invention that re-energizes people and makes their lives in and around the institutions in which they function at the same time more liveable and more intense.
It was Erin who started the SenseLab, which I then joined as a collaborator. Looking at the milieus we were in and between, the art and academic institutions, we thought that there are things each side could offer the other – seeds of symbiosis. From the academic side, what could be brought into the art world is a tendency or propensity towards rigorous verbal expression. On the art side is a complementary propensity to invest in an object or system or interaction an intensity that rigorously exceeds language, at least standard denotative or referential uses of language. We wanted to bring together those two tendencies: bringing concepts to rigorous verbal expression, and intensifying perception and experience.
