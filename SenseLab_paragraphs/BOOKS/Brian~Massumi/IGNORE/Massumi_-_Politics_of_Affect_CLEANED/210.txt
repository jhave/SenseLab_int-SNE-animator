mechanisms of power? How can those who most directly apply those mechanisms of power not become  a new class, with its own special interests (the criticalideological avant-garde turning  into an apparatchik class)? How can those special interests not re-appeal to affect in an attempt to maintain the now resurgent mirage of the ‘general’ interest? In short, how can the dominant ideology be changed without imposing a new one that in the end reinscribes much the same structure, and works with much the same presuppositions, as the old one – and is no less a structure of domination?
