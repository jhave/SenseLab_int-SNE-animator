If you say, ‘Isn’t life the answer?’ to the question what a body can do, the answer is ‘Yes’. But you have to make life an adverb: lively. It’s about liveliness or liveness. There is no life substance. Life is not a thing. Life is the way in which the mental and physical poles of events come together – differently every time, always under singular circumstances, moving in the general direction of the accumulation in the world of differences, of improvised novelty. Whitehead says that life is in the intervals between things – in the way things relate, in the way they come together in events under the dominant tendency towards the generation of new forms, or ontogenesis.
