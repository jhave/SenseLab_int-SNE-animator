The call to go beyond ideology is a call to attend to the novelty of this situation, and to find ways of conceptualizing the current mode of operation of the capitalist process, and the new kinds of spin-off effects it produces, that are capable of grasping its novelty and complexity. How can a relational approach give us a new understanding of capitalism as a self-proliferating process? What are the new figures of that relation? Is the figuring still a question of personification? If so, is identification still at the basis of the figures of capital? If capitalism’s operativity has become so complex, its ‘instruments’ so abstract, as to defy logic – and yet remain intensely effective – is it still a ‘rationality’? If it is not a rationality, how can we continue to speak of ideology – the very construction of which posits a logos, an ideational foundation? What does all this mean for resistance?
