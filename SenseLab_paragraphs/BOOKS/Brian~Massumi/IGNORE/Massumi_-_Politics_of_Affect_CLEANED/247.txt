I call a process that augments powers of existence an ontopower. Capitalism has made itself a species of ontopower. The task of resistance in the contemporary age is not just to fight power, it is to learn how to fight this ontopower. The battle that is being waged on resistance’s own home ground: ontopower against ontopower, on the same field of battle, flush with the same events, in immanent critique. There is no alternative to immanent critique. Capitalism is now effectively global. There is no outside of the capitalist process. There is no position from which to critique it from outside. It is in our bodies, in our lives’ arising, in bare activity, in every little niche of the collective field.
