Mary Zournazi: The idea of ‘controlled walking’ is a good example of what you were just talking about in terms of the limitations on the self and the freedoms that are possible. But I am also thinking about it as relating to the idea of ‘societies of control’ – which you have written about. We now live in societies of control, so how do control and power in this new age also offer the possibility of freedom?
