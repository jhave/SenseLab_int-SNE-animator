always doing something – or a something doing moving into a pragmatic unfolding at a later phase. What interested her was distilling pragmatic working points from the discussion, and then honing them as procedures that can be set in place in particular situations to condition events of emergence. Naming is a technique for fixing the procedures, in the sense that you fix a compound. It gives you a practical handle on what region of potential you’ve collectively brought to provisional expression, and holds it together in a way that you can do things with. This is a very different use of language than the way academics usually communicate. When you go to a conference, you can’t help being subjectively positioned, from the moment you put on your name badge. You are not just registering your presence, you’re representing yourself, and you speak accordingly. Your angle of entry into the situation is personalized in this way.
This assumes that your identity coincides with your potential, and that when we express ourselves, it’s in this individualized mode of potential. It is exactly doing what Simondon warns against: mistaking the field potential from which an individuation emerges for the interiority of a subject. Needless to say, it creates anxiety. It cuts off many other modes of activity and catalysings of relation that could make the situation more of an event, and more open-ended. The question the SenseLab started with was, how do we make ourselves an event? How do we come together actively, as artists, academics and activists, in ways that don’t just reproduce the usual genres of ‘communication’? What relational procedures, or techniques of relation, can we collectively invent, name and put into situational practice for making events that truly deserve to be called events?
