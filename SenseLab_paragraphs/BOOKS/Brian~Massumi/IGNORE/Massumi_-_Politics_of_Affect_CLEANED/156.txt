Microperception is bodily. There is no fright, or any affect for that matter, without an accompanying movement in or of the body. This is the famous James–Lange thesis. In fact, the thesis goes further, so far as to say that this bodily commotion is what an emotion is. James calls it emotion, but at the generative level it is what we’re calling affect. The James–Lange thesis has been widely criticized as reductive, but this is to misunderstand it. Because the body, in this eventful re-beginning, carries tendencies reviving the past and already striving towards a future. In its commotion are capacities reactivating, being primed to play out, in a heightening or diminishing of their collective power of existence. The body figures here as a cut in the continuity of relation, filled with potential for re-relating, with a difference. Microperceptual shock is like a re-cueing of our bodily powers of existence. Here, the body is what Peirce calls a ‘material quality’: a coming quality of experience that is being actively lived-in before it’s actually lived out. It’s lived-in in intensity, in a kind of existential agitation, a poising or posturing for the coming event, a kind of recoil, not to withdraw from the world, but rather to brace for it again, and for how else it will be.
