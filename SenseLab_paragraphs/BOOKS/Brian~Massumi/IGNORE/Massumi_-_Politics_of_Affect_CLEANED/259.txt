I don’t believe that our condition is homogenizing, as so many critiques of the contemporary media environment say, or that things work in the first instance by positioning the individual, as ideological critique might say – even though there are certain presuppositions that get performatively implanted in the field, and certain tendencies already vectorizing it, in a kind of protoorganization of what is happening. The main point is it’s  all  happening  far-from-equilibrium,  so  that  what counts is the fielding of instability, and the fact that unpredictable   order-out-of-chaos   effects   can   always disable, deviate or reconfigure any pre-organization. So when  I’m  talking  about  affect  I’m  talking  about  a directly relational immersion in a field of immi(a)nence from	which	determined	actions	and	determinate thoughts  have  to  emerge.  They  have  to  be  extracted from the field of complexity on the fly, performatively. The  question  then  becomes,  what  modulates  the extraction?
