The logic of this mutual inclusion is neither the logic of the disjunctive plurality, nor the logic of the dynamic unity that is its virtual expression. It’s the logic of their inter-involvement. It has to do with what Bergson calls pure multiplicities, as different from plurality, or diversity in the sense of a set of countable elements. Bergson says that there are phenomena consisting in a continual turnover of qualitative changes that actively interpenetrate, that include each other in process. You can’t separate them out, and you cannot count them,  because there are zones of overlap, zones of indistinction where they are absorbed in each other, and because the turnover is so quick that there is never a moment where you could point to a separate figure as a unity, in the way the Kanizsa triangle stood out as a unitary figure.
