It has become a commonplace recently to say that we are in a situation where the end of the world is now imaginable – but the end of capitalism isn’t. That is definitely one ‘solution’ that is not likely to come programmatically, top-down – given who’s on top. The dismantling of capitalism is a ‘corrective’ that will only come from a breaking of the reciprocity I was just talking about between the macroand  micropolitical. The prevailing operating conditions of macro-/micropolitical reciprocity should not be taken to imply that the symmetry is never broken, that a bifurcation can never occur. The complementarity can be broken  in both directions. When macro-structures miniaturize themselves and work to usurp the ground of the micropolitical with scaled-down versions of the dominant generalities, that is fascism. When micropolitical flourishings proliferate to produce a singularity, in the sense of a macrosystemic tipping point, that’s  revolution. The ultimate vocation of micropolitics is this: enacting the unimaginable. The symmetry-breaking, the point at which the unimaginable eventuates, is but a cut, ‘smaller’ than the smallest historically perceivable interval. That is to say, qualitatively different. A moment of a different colour, one you never see coming, that comes when it’s least expected. Inevitably, a next micro/macro complementarity will quickly settle in. But it will take a form that could not have been predicted, but is now suddenly doable and thinkable. Micropolitics is what makes the unimaginable practicable. It’s the potential that makes possible.
