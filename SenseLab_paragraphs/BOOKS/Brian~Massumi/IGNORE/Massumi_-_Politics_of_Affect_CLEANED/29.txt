Erin Manning holds a University Research Chair in Relational Art and Philosophy in the Faculty of Fine Arts at Concordia University, Montreal, Canada. She is also the  director  of  the  SenseLab  (www.senselab.ca), a laboratory that explores  the  intersections  between art practice and philosophy through the matrix of the sensing body in movement. Her current art practice is centred on large-scale participatory installations that facilitate emergent collectivities. Current art projects are focused on the concept of ‘minor gestures’ in relation to colour, movement and participation. Publications include Always More Than One: Individuation’s Dance (2013), Relationscapes: Movement, Art, Philosophy (2009) and, with Brian Massumi, Thought in the Act: Passages in the Ecology of Experience (2014). Forthcoming book projects include a translation of Fernand Deligny’s Les détours de l’agir ou le moindre geste and a monograph entitled The Minor Gesture. She is the founder of the SenseLab and founding editor of Inflexions: A Journal for Research-Creation.
