Reactive forces, in Deleuze’s words, are those which ‘separate other forces from what they can do’. They are tendencies towards repetition (reduction of difference), stabilization and rest (de-intensification), division and subsumption (divide and conquer). Deleuze develops a fascinating account of the relation between active and reactive forces in his book on Nietzsche.4 One of my earliest books, First and Last Emperors: The Absolute State and the Body of the Despot,5 explored the constitutive tensions of the reactive forces as they amplify in scale and play out society-wide. For the present discussion, the important point in the notion of microfascism is that there is no original state of freedom that is somehow fettered, but to which we can nurse the dream to return. The seeds of oppression are always already sown, and are always already in play. Affective dynamics not only can but are destined to give rise to oppressive structures. Servitude, as much of oneself as of others, servitude to structures of power at whatever level, is energetically, collectively desired. In the 1930s the ‘masses’, Deleuze and Guattari say, were not ideologically duped into submitting to fascism. They positively desired it. They actively affirmed it. Fascism emerged from the bareactive stirrings of a mode of collective affective attunement tending towards ressentiment, which it amplified and reinforced, organized and returned to, then fed off in an infernal cycle.
