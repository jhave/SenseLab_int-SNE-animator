So you canâ€™t put positive or negative connotations on affect. That would be to judge it from the outside. It would be going in a moralizing direction. Spinoza makes a distinction between a morality and an ethics. To move in an ethical direction, from a Spinozan point of view, is not to attach positive or negative values to actions based on a characterization or classification of them according to a pre-set system of judgement. It means assessing what kind  of potential  they tap into  and express. Whether a person is going to joke or get angry when they are in a tight spot, that uncertainty produces an affective change in the situation. That affective loading and how it plays out is an ethical act, because it affects where people might go or what they might do as a result. It has consequences.
