For Whitehead, the physical dimension of the body corresponds to actions performed in conformity to the past, continuing along the same lines as it, following the same schema. Thus the physical is a principle of conformity to already-emerged form. What characterizes mentality is the capacity to go beyond that givenness to improvise new forms. Note that I said ‘mentality’, and not ‘the mind’. Here, mentality is a mode of activity, and it functions not in opposition to the physical but with it and through it, by prolonging and renewing it.
