So the question of affective politics for me is accepting that we’re in that field of collective differential attunement that triggers a collective individuation, and that we’re always being thrown back into it in a direct, immersive, immediated way, and then  asking what counter-ontopower we can exercise to get ourselves out of that securitization loop. How can we exert some influence flush with that  immersion,  but  disabling or disenabling the presuppositions of securitization? How can we implant new presuppositions, and protoorganize more liveable and convivial tendencies? How can we implant new tendencies into that hypercomplex ecological field of life? I think a concept like the biogram is a very good place to begin. The biogram is a version of Gilles Deleuze’s concept of the ‘diagram’, but applied to an individual life modulating its own course under conditions of complexity. To diagram, or biogram, is not to pre-define. It’s a cartography of potential. It’s about techniques for moving into and out of the immersive field of life complexity in a way that is oriented, or reorienting, but not in pre-articulated directions – inventively. Then the question is how you prolong the differential attunement, instead of coming out of it into your own personal trajectory. How do you capture the intensity of the in-bracing to remain correlated, to coordinate, to move inventively together in concerted action – crucially, without erasing the attuned differences?
