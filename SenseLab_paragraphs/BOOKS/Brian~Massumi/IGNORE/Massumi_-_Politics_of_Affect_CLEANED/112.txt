new. It didn’t just happen around the September 11 events, it just sort of came out then, became impossible to ignore. In the early 1990s I put together a book called The Politics of Everyday Fear.1 It dealt with the same kind of mechanisms, but it was coming out of the experience of the 1980s, the  Reagan  years.  This directly affective media power has been around at least since television matured as a medium – which was about when it took power literally, with the election of Reagan, an old TV personality, as head of state. The functions of head of state and commander-in-chief of the military fused with the role of the television personality. The American president was not a statesman any more, like Woodrow Wilson or Franklin Roosevelt were. He was a visible personification of that affective media loop. The face of mass affect. Now, the internet is taking up where television left off. With the internet, the affective conversion loops becomes more diffuse and distributed – and all the more insidious. What was once mass affect has now entered into the micropolitical realm, where it proliferates. This allows it to mutate more readily into new variations, but also for some of those variations to spike virally.
