This likeness of the event to itself is as much a part of the event as what actually happens causally, for example in terms of what molecules shift place. It's directly experienced, even though it can't be equated with the causal movement. It's in the movement of the event as such. It's part of the quality of the event. The qualitative aspect of the event that you can't reduce to quantifiable movements is what I call the semblance of the event (Massumi 2011). My proposition is that this qualitative aspect is where the aesthetic dimension lies. That minimal difference is what the philosopher Raymond Ruyer calls its "aesthetic yield." The question for art is: what can be done with that? What may art do? Does it develop that minimal difference into a big difference that might lead to new reflections? Does it lift that event-quality out of the event, holding it in suspense? Does it suspend the already established functionings of the organism and the already established meanings of the context, at least for an instant before they fall back into place as the event peaks? Does it suspend the connection to form and function, and allow the dawning event's fullness with potential to vibrate? If it does that, where can that lead? What can it bring it out, if anything? Does it short-circuit reflection? Or carry it to a higher power?
