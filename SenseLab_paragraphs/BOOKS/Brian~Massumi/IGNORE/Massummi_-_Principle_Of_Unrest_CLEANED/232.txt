Now it is undeniably conceivable that a beginningless series of successive utterers should all do their work in a brief interval of time, and that so should an endless series of interpreters. Still, it is not likely to be denied that, in some cases, neither the series of utterers nor that of interpeters forms an infinite collection. When this is the case, there must be a sign without an utterer and a sign without an interpreter. … Neither an utterer, nor even, perhaps, an interpreter is essential to a sign. … I am led to inquire whether there be not some ingredient of the utterer and some ingredient of the interpreter which not only are so essential, but are even more characteristic of signs than the utterer or interpeter themselves. 
-- C.S. Peirce (1998: 403-404)
