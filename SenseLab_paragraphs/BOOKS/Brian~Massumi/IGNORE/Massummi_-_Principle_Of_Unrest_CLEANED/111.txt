This is a very complex moment, having everything to do with the politicization of personality. But I am convinced that the extreme personalization of politics we see with Trump cannot be understood in traditional psychological or psychoanalytic terms, in particular in terms of identification. Franco "Bifo" Berardi's recent work, for example, makes the mistake of psychologizing the field of capitalist life. But the dividualization of the person has gone too far for that. We need new tools to understand the profundity of Trump's superficiality, and the force of its reinvention of fascism for the neoliberal age, adapted to the figure of the enterprise-subject and appreciative of the duplicities of the dividual. We need to think hard about the stupidity, the willful stupidity, and the way Trump's personal embodiment of it collectively mobilizes. We do not have a model for this. It is too dangerous to rely on models from the past.
