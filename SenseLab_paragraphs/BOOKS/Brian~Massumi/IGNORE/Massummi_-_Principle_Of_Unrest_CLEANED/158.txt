Under certain conditions – and these conditions are rare – a grand gesture may open the relational field in a way that the minor gestures swarming in it have room to amplify and bloom. It can only do this if it is not stuck in its own programmatic groove: if its programmatic pronouncements carry an illocutionary force, not expressed in their semantic context, that makes them performative of a schizz leaving a proliferating pattern of cracks for bare activity to seep through, each crack oozing potentials for surplus-value of life. The micro-cracks may proliferate to the extent that they converge into a macro-shatter: a revolutionary passing of a threshold.
