Debunking the fictions, unveiling the illusions, will do little by themselves. That can actually be counterproductive, if it leads to a misapprehension of the affective environment and the counter-powers that may be found in it in germ. An overreliance on critique is destructive of potential, because it perpetuates the myth of reason's motivating power and encourages an underappreciation of the power of affect, where activated potential dwells. Critique is demobilizing. Affect is by nature mobilizing â€“ which is why it can be both dangerous and empowering. The quality of the movements that are primed out of it are what is crucial. What tendencies are tweaked from it are what is decisive.
