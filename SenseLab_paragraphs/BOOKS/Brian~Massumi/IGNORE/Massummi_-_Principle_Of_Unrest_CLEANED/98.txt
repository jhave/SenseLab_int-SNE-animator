They are living up to their dividuality. We all do that, must do that. Precisely because "there is no outside of capitalism," said once again in a way that does not mean that we are all simply "in" it. At the same time as exploitation ceases to be meaningfully measurable, complicity does as well. All the more reason to insist on directly qualitative understandings of economic processes, on the need for purely qualitative notions of value, and a complex appreciation of how they are articulated to the mechanisms of quantification that are everywhere in capitalism. That is not a simple task. Our understanding of nonquantitative surplus-values of life cannot simply be conceived. As their name implies, they must be lived. Their living beyond capitalism is still to be invented. And all the more reason not to be seduced by the breeziness of the accelerationist thesis.
