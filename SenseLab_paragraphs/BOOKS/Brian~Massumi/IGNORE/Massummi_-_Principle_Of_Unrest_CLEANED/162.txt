This makes preemption a directly temporal mode of power. It requires the application of what some military strategists have called "the force to own time." You have to act not in time, but on time. You have to go back to the "before," as it is in the present. This is the present-futurity of what already potentially brewing, about to brim over into action. You have to act on the incipiency of actions to come. This poses sticky perceptual problems.
