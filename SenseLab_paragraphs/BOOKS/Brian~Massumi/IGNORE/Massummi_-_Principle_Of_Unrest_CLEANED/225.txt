AH: I’d love to hear more about reactivating a notion of intuition, either in relation to art practice or in relation to political activism. In relation to art practice it has been such a degraded term, partly because of its association with the holding of transcendent powers and the mystification of processes, and in activism I’m not sure how it would even begin to operate as a notion. Had you thoughts on that?
