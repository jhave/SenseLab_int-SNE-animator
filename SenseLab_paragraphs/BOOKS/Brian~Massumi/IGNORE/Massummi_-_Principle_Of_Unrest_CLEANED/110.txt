BM: Well, if anyone has doubts about the limits of political reason, they need only read an account of a Trump campaign rally or listen to a Trump speech. We were warned. From Ronald Reagan's "facts are stupid things" to the George W. Bush administration's condescending dismissal of  the "reality-based community," the role of critical factual analysis and poltical reason has been on the wane. Trump sounds the death-knell of its power to be determining. Trump can contradict himself from one sentence to the next. He can change his policies today, and change them back tomorrow. His supporters know very well he is doing it. But it does not matter. The Trump-effect is operating in a totally different register, a different kind of "knowing" immune to the need for argumentative consistency. With Trump, a threshold has been passed. I seriously doubt, now that he has won the presidency, that there is any going back.
