BM: I have a lot of sympathy with this concern, but prefer not to use the words illusion or delusion because of the traces of those other ways of thinking – the too-earnest way of the militant and the way of the cynic – that they might reawaken. I prefer an analytic of stupidity, but one that recognizes that we are all in the same boat together, that none of us is immune from stupidity, or what Spinoza calls "inadequate ideas," because the error at the root of them is of the warp and woof of perception itself. It's constitutional. It has to do with what Deleuze and Guattari sometimes call "objective illusions," true and necessary illusions. Stupidity is holding obstinately to objective illusions, and allowing one's actions, even one's entire life, to revolve around them. This is not just a personal question, and has nothing to do with lesser intelligence or an inability to be rational. It is an existential posture having to do with how one's life is anchored in the field of bare activity, and what potentials that posture toward the immanent limit allows to express themselves – how a body perceives and channels potential.
