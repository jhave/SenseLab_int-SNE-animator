BM: Well, the only way to do that is to stir the mix, and make what may come, come. Flush it out into taking a determinate form you can determinedly attack. Make it start to "go kinetic" so you can meet it, counter-kinetically, as it is just arising, before it has actioned-out, before it can detonate, and before it can defend itself. This is what I call the "perception attack." The practice of war recenters on the problem of the preemptive perception attack. The perception attack is a way of taking the battlefield into the field of emergence, of weaponizing potential. It is military power becoming-immanent to life's field of emergence: "endocolonizing" (Virilio) the transformational-relational field; capturing change itself. This is a kind of power that is productive of what it fights: the perception-attack leavens the threat, makes it rise, so it can be seen, recognized, and stamped out, before it solidifies into an objective danger.
