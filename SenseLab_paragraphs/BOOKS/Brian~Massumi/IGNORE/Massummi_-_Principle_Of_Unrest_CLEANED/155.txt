What I mean by that is a maximally inclusive co-patterning of contrasting tendencies, co-habiting the field in a way that facilitates each fully realizing itself. What I mean by that is following the field's tendential bent to its ulterior limit â€“ where it bends back to the immanent limit, where it risks becoming eventfully, irredeemably other, as a function of its own self-accomplishment. The challenge of the co-patterning is to facilitate this passage to the limit of tendencies' intensive becoming in way that they do not oppose and curtail each other.
