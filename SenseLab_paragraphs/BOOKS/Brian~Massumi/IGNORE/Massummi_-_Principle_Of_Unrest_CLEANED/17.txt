BM: Capitalism may well be the figure in which the movement I was just describing actually exceeds the human. The neoliberal moment might be thought of as a vector of becoming coming out the far side of our humanity. It is the moment when market mechanisms declared their autonomy, and the economy became a regime of power in its own right. Governments, let alone individual actors, feel they have no choice but to conform to the operating conditions it sets for them. The cutting edge of capitalism is in the financial markets, which have evolved forms of abstract capital so abstruse, contingent, and objectively undecidable that it is impossible to get an effective grip on them. They run according their own process, and sometimes run away with themselves, periodically crashing and burning. The financialized economy is beyond the human pale: beyond full human comprehension and beyond effective human control. It is a self-driving machine, operating more and more abstractly, with no one in particular at the steering wheel. It was created by the human, but not in its own image, emerging rather as a monstrous offspring that turns back to engulf its maker and drive away with it.
