The tendency to isolate the object and glom onto to it as the visible index of what in the relational field exceeds present perception and extends in a future-oriented direction into the imperceptibly felt is, paradoxically, of the very nature of perception. It is of the nature of perception to exceed itself. Perception is constituted by this topological torsion, whereby the relational in-which of a pulse of life, the affective matrix of the effectively lived occasion, the impossibility of assigning passive and active roles as long as the relational complexity of that occasion is being fully felt, is projected outward and undergoes a transformation. The complexity is projected onto an objectified region of the external world. It is important not to understand "projection" to imply that there was a pre-existing interiority, and that something in it is displaced toward a pre-existing outside. I'm using the word in the way Whitehead and Simondon use it, which is a bit of a misnomer because the idea is that the "inside" of perception arises with its relative outside, as a co-effect of the objectification of an external region: they are reciprocals, co-generated (this is the case for all inside/outside structurations or systematizations).
