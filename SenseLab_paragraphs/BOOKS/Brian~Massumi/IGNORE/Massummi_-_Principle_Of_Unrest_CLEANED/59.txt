BM: Marx defines capitalist relation as a conjunction between a flow of labor-power and a flow of money as salary, cross-cut by a flow of commodities and a flow of money as means of payment. Each conjunction presents itself as an equal exchange, value for value, as measured by money in yet another guise, as general equivalent. In reality, the exchange is unequal. The capitalist relation is actually predicated on an asymmetry: profit. An excess is skimmed off, and channeled into yet another form of  money: investment money. Technically, capital is not the quantity of profit, but rather the ability of investment money to produce an increased quantity of money in the future. That increase-over any present quantity of money, already present in investment potential, is capitalist surplus-value.
