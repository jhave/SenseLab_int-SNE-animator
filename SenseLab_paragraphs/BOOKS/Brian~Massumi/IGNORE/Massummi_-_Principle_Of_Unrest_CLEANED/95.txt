The Adventure Capital project seeks to retain the aspect of the logic of derivatives that overspills quantification in the production of surplus-value, but does so in a way that fosters the invention of forms of life, valued in and for themselves, rather than being predicated on the appropriation of their emergence. Rather than leveraging them toward capitalist ends, they would be enabled to self-leverage, to leaven themselves, toward their own emergent ends.
