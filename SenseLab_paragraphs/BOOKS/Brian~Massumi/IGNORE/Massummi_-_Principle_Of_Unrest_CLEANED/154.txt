1) "Micro-" or "minor" are not necessarily synonymous with "small." Again, it is all about qualitative distinctions. "Small" is relative to scale. A minor event in a group interaction is "larger" than a minor event in an individual's perceptual consitution, and a minor event in the media is "larger" than both. The criterion is qualitative. It bears on the smooth-over-ability of the event. Its negligibility. A minor event is imperceptible, but on the verge of becoming-perceptible. It is on the edge of perception's forming, on its fateful, cutting edge. A minor gesture leavens the minor event into perceptibility, so that it is no longer negligible but comes to matter. It is equal to fate. Micropolitics is the politics of making-matter. It is not just any making-matter, but one oriented toward joy. Joy involves the "tragic" affirmation of the integrality of the tendencies plying the relational field, in the name of surplus-value of life. In political terms, this means the mutual differential inclusion of individuals in the event â€“ but as grasped from the angle of their dividuality, from the angle of their activated, agitating, potentializing participation in transformational-relational field of bare activity. Micropolitics is the modulation of this dynamic differential mutual inclusion, tending toward greater field-intensities.
