Counter-ontopower's orientation is aesthetic, not warlike (which is one of the reasons I prefer the vocabulary of activism to that of militantism). Counter-ontopowers move within the horizon of the discordant co-patterning of incommensurable contrasts that constitute Whitehead's beauty. They are tendentially nonviolent, in a way that does not translate into the moralism associated with nonviolence as a transcendent principle. For counter-ontopowers, there are no transcendent principles, just immanent stirrings and self-affirming arcs of self-accomplishment, cycling back in a looping that is cut into, schizzed wide open, by strange intrusions, returning always to the great outside. This is what Whitehead called the "adventure." We should goad each other on to adventure, not beat each other with weaponized potential, or brow-beat each other with militant pronouncements.
