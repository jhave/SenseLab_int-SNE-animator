As Ã‰lie Ayache shows (2010), in the world of derivatives, pricing, the measure of value, loses its mooring. It becomes a pure effect of the conjunction of abstract flows, of flows of capital intersecting at an arbitrary point where the event of a transaction occurs, often automatically through the decision of an algorithm. Derivatives are justified as a way of "putting a price on risk." But that assumes that risk is calculable, which is little more than a kind of magical thinking conjuring away the contingency endemic to far-from-equilibrium systems with the wave of an abstract wand (whose name is probability).
