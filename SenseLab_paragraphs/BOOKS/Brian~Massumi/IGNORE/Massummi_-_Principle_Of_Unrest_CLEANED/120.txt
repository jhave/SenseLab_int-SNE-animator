The main point for this discussion is that the objectified region stands out as a limited clarification of the complexity of the relational field, which is presented in it in a restrictive expression, strictly in terms of the world's regularities and their anticipatable results. The region indexes what is pertinent to what might come next, with an emphasis on the body's capacity to act, but only as a function of what it recognizes. As Bergson said, perception is the way in which our virtual actions actually present themselves. Whitehead calls this necessary but reductive topological transformation of the relational field of life "transmutation." In both cases, the operation is intimately related to the needs and fragilities of the body. It is a necessary operation for the resolution of problems of need.
