When an actual thing is found to fulfill the role of the verb's some/ones or some/things, the process still does not end. Termini are slippery things. The question "which?" just sets the stage for the follow-up question what else? What else was required for the required determination to be fulfilled? What more is there that would even more determinately determine the sense of the sign –for example by filling in details or filling out its background? Or by specifying how it plays its role in the event. In what manner is the what-else co-determining of what happens? Thus it is not simply a question of some/ones or some/things being actually present or not. It is also the way in which they are present, or would have been. Peirce insists that the Object of thought-expression as quaesitum is necessarily "singular, not general." The Object, when there actually is one, is not general, but neither is it a particular this-here. It is this-here-in-this-way, along with all else that made it so – and would potentially have made it otherwise. What else? is not a controllable question. It is "impossible to complete our collateral observation" (Peirce 1998: 409). Where does the seeking stop? Between every two would-be this-heres there potentially lies another. At the limit, "there is a continuum between them." The Object, "though singular, may nevertheless be multiple, and may even be infinitely so" (408; emphasis added).
