BM: I would say the mundane is full of events. They're just events that on the surface present themselves as being more repetition than variation, or that background themselves behind other events or objects that might stand out in relief. The object is not a non-event. It's just a slower-paced event compared to our activity around it, or toward it. An object is full of activity, in it and all around. There's activity inside it that’s invisible to the human eye because it's too small or too fast. The material that composes it is churning with action on the molecular level. And there's activity around that changes it at rate too slow to see – the way it weathers for example, or goes through a phase-shift, like sap to amber. In our mundane relation to objects, we connect with them between these two extremes, where the object is sluggish relative to the swiftness of our hands, but not too slow to grasp. The object is not the opposite of the event, it's a certain nexus of events. So you’re right, if you start rethinking philosophy emphasizing the eventfulness of life, you have to rethink a host of concepts.
