The point for me is to resituate the systemic context in process, as I defined it earlier. If identity-based practices are strategically necessary at certain political junctures, then it is also necessary to take them to the immanent limit, to supplement them with agitations, with just-emergent activity at the threshold of the knowable, felt unrecognizably, but in a way that is already becoming actionable, without cycling through the detour of a becoming-reactive: with direct plumbings of liminal potential for the integral modulation of the relational field. With accessions to counter-ontopower on an affirmative note, in the key of invention. I understand Fred Moten and Stefano Harney's concept of "black study" in these terms (Moten and Harney 2013).
