You could even say that every tendency arising in the capitalist field is adventitious to the extent that it affirms itself: to the extent that experiences its own coming to pass as a value in itself, independently of the monetary value that it may attributed to it. Such tendencies are passional: that is the best word for a movement that affirms its own occurring. Love is a good example, as long as the analogy is not taken too far, since the kinds of tendencies I'm talking about come in many an affective form â€“ we're back at the affective level I talked about earlier. Love is tied up with all manner of economic pressures and opportunities, but we still seek and sustain it for its own sake. We value it for its own quality, for the heightening of experience it brings: for the qualitative surplus-value it offers. For neoliberal economists, this kind of noncapitalist surplus-value is a problem. Its affirmation may well lead a person, in the name of "quality of life," to resist the role of "human capital" that neoliberalism assigns to them. Human capital is the idea, foundational to neoliberalism, that human life not only serves the capitalist relation, but that it is a form of capital: that everyone's basic "job," which we are hired into simply by virtue of being born, is to be an "entrepreneur of oneself": to make every decision, including how one spend's one leisure time, including what kind of affective alliances to enter into, based on how it will optimize one's competitiveness, increase one's market value, in order to yield the maximum monetizable return in the future.
