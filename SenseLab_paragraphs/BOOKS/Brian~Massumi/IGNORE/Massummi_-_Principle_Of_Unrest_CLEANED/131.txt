Reaction is a sundering of the affective field. It does violence to it by imposing an opposition between activity and passivity. To react is to assume a posture of passivity in the face of a threat which, for a shocking moment, seems to monopolize all potential for action, leaving a body in suspense, in pained anticipation, cowering before potential rather than embodying a share of it. Reactivity separates a body from what it can do, as Deleuze puts it.
