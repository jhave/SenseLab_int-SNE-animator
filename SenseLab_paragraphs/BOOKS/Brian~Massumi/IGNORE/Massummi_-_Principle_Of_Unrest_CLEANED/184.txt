BM: I think philosophy has to continually renegotiate its relationship to other disciplines. I wouldn’t say that I’m opposed to disciplinarity, but I am opposed to the control disciplines try to exert over forms of thought that operate otherwise or elsewhere, in the interstices or on the periphery. At the same time, I don’t see philosophy as interdisciplinary, in the way it's usually practiced. I think you have to approach any mode of thought or experience as a function of its limits. If you think of a certain kind of activity as oriented by a tendency, you can ask where that tendency leads when it is taken to the limit. That amounts to asking what that mode of activity can do when it's doing what it does best, and in what sense that is something only it can do. Take it on a run to the limit of what it can do, and see what comes, as an experiment. Philosophy is the activity of running thought experiments.
