Another example are the potentials of the blockchain form behind Bitcoin. Bitcoin, and its offspring Ethereum, are runaway speculative forms of capital whose escape was only apparent. They were designed to be convertible into fiat money, and they reproduced many of the same functions underpinning finance: a transactional model in which exchange was the basic social relation; a quantified system of value, enabling exchange to be construed as equal (value for value); a definition of the financial actor as share-holder, preserving private ownership; and all of this within an economy of scarcity (there is a limit to the number of Bitcoin that can be mined). What Bitcoin did was to demonstrate that speculative finance could operate independently of the banks, corporate and sovereign, that are currently at the heart of the financial system, and outside the existing political hierarchies. It gave birth to the "distributed autonomous organization," or DAO. As the blockchain has evolved, the simple transaction model of exchange is being replaced the idea of "smart contracts" that could take any number of forms. Some people are intrigued by the idea that the smart contract could be stretched beyond the traditional economic model, to become the basis for what are essentially social pacts operating according to another logic. This would enable a DAO to prefigure a different economy in miniature.
