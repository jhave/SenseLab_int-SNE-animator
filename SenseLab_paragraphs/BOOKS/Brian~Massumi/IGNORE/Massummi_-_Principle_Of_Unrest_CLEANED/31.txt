Representation is dead – if it was ever really alive. Who today feels truly represented by their elected government? Witness the exodus from the established parties throughout the world, most vividly illustrated by the rise of the populist "independent" voter in the United States and elsewhere who disavows any party allegiance that would inscribe them in the institutionalized, normative functionings of their supposedly representative governmental system. The result is a simultaneous leakage from the left and the right, producing an increasing polarization. The mechanism of representation is obsolete. It assumes a stable identity on both scales: a government that mirrors who its citizens are, and citizens who embody the identity of the state, in a mutually structuring embrace. The prevailing conditions, however, are of continual qualitative change, ceaseless transformational relational movements – as far from a stable structure as you can get. The structural embrace has been swept through by becoming, transversed by flows that are increasingly uncontrolled by anyone or any one institution in particular.
