To return to the point I was making, with surplus-value of flow, the differential between input of labor and surplus-value tends toward the exponential. In the case of form-of-life mining, the possibility of quantifying the exploitation is no longer present at all. How do you compare the theft of an expression of a mode-of-life's self-affirming with a quantity of profit? The exploitation is in fact directly qualitative. This is easy to see, for example, when indigenous peoples' cultural signs and sacred symbols become commercialized motifs on outdoor wear (to cite a recent example of the poaching of Inuit motifs by a European clothes manufacturer). The grief over the degradation of an expression of a qualitatively different mode of life that has formerly been purely self-affirming dwarfs the grief of the loss of any income the preyed-upon communities might have made by controlling their so-called "intellectual property."
