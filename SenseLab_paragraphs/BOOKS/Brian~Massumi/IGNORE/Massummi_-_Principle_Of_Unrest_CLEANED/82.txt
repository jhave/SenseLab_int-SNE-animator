From my perspective, the move to accelerate only becomes compelling in light of the kinds of qualitative considerations I have been arguing for, connecting them to the idea of bare activity as the immanent limit of capitalism. The only reason to push capitalism beyond its pale is to allow non-capitalist forms of surplus-value to affirm themselves in the expression of potentials for qualitatively different movements and modes of relation whose value is their own occurrence, whose only justification is their lived quality: what I called a minute ago surplus-values of life. Anywhere a non-monetized surplus-value of life is generated there has occurred what I term, again following Deleuze and Guattari, an escape to the immanent limit. Escapes can be deviations, perversions, hijacking, hackings. They come in many varieties.
