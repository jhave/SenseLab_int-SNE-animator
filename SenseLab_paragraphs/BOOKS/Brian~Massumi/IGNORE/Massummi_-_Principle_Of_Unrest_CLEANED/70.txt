A process is unbounded â€“ but limited. It is limited by its ability to dip into the unlimited of the great outside. This reserve of bare activity that it verges on is its immanent limit. This is a way of saying that the capitalist process, as apparatus of capture of monetary surplus-value in symbiosis with any number of institutions and quasi-institutions sharing its field, is paradoxically limited by potential. Capitalism is continually pushing its immanent limit further by finding more and more ways to redescend to the emergent level of the world's movements. Earlier I mentioned some of the ways this happens: biotechnology, affect, and what I called surplus-value of flow, the extraction of surplus-value purely as a movement-effect. The extraction of surplus-value of flow is always resonant with affect, whether on Facebook or in the financial markets, which are like mood rings of fear and anticipation. Still, even in the face of these ontopowers, the continual giving-of-itself of potential outstrips the capacity of capitalism, and its fellow-traveling institutions, to capture it and channel it to their own ends. There is always a remainder: an excess of potential over capture, of bare activity over useful function, of just-arising over normalized operation. If you define action in terms of functionality or operativity, then there is always an excess of activity over action. In Deleuze and Guattari's vocabulary, there are always "lines of flight" suggesting themselves: tendential movements which, if extended to follow their own arc, uncaptured, would move in very different directions than the established channels: these are the counter-ontopowers I mentioned earlier.
