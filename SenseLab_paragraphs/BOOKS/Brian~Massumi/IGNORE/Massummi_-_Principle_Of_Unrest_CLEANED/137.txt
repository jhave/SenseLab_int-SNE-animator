BM: In his Late Notebooks, Nietzsche gives an account of this becoming-reactive as a constitutive function of perception in ways that relate directly to the concept of the dividual I have been talking about (2003: 34-35, 37-38). He describes what I call bare activity, the transformational-relational field of affect at the level of emergence, where events and actions are just edging into determinate existence. He talks about how conscious thought and voluntary action begin in a nonconscious or liminally conscious welling of bodily sensations, feelings of all kinds: desires, aversions, and germinating abstractions that are not yet owned by an "I" but agitate on their own, for themselves.
