BM: Intellectual property is the form in which social or cultural difference – qualitative relational difference – is monetized. It marks a partial belonging, a non-exclusive inclusion, in the capitalist system of movements that do not flow first and foremost according to capitalism's logic, as governed by the attractor of the capitalist relation: a capture of something that is incorporated into capital while remaining resistent to it, that is taken into it but is never wholly of it; a forced complicity (calling for strategic duplicity). The concerns for "cultural preservation," which translates here into the preservation of minoritarian becomings affirming a surplus-value of collective life, and concerns for protecting intellectual property may occur together. But this does not make them the same thing. They are incomparables. The processual distance between them is immeasurable. They belong to qualitatively different logics. A person or group who holds to both cannot be dismissed as a dupe to capitalism, as unwittingly falling into a contradiction, or as complicit in the way the word is so often used with moralistic overtones.  
Rather than falling into a contradiction, what they are doing is straddling a schizz.
