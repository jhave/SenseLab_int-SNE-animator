BM: Another way that what I have been saying deviates from traditional Marxist concepts is that the notion of surplus-value of flow I talked about toward the beginning of the interview calls into question the labor theory of value, which was long considered the sine non qua of Marxist analysis. Surplus-value of flow is an example of what Deleuze and Guattari term "machinic surplus-value" (even when it isn't generated by machines in the narrow sense; machinic can be taken as a synonym for "processual"; Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 232-237). The old labor theory of value is the idea that all surplus-value production is based on leveraging labor time â€“ basically, the theft of a portion of what is produced, as measured by the difference between workers' labor-time, expressed monetarily as salary, and the capitalist's returns.
