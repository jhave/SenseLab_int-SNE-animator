AH: I’m wondering if there might be a tension between those two tactics, because one of the things that capital does is to forcibly accelerate processes and time; ephemerality is highly amenable to that acceleration. But I’m wondering if, as a tactic, slow time, slow down, endurance, is actually more affective simply because it runs counter to the temporal organization of capital; the imperative to condense and traverse space, to move ever faster. Or, perhaps the ephemeral strategy, to be effective at all, might be more to do with a tactic of radically multiplying ephemeralities to a point of excess. So a catastrophic speed-up that brings structures, logics and forms to the point of collapse.
