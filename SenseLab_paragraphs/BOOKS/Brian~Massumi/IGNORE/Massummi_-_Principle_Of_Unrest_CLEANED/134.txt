The operation activates, but only to the extent that it is possible to do so by mobilizing anger, the most active of the "sad" affects. But like all sad affects, anger remains on the reactive spectrum. What has been achieved is a becoming-active ofÂ the reactive (re-activity). Each renewed act of resistance must run back through, from hurt to anger to critique, in a cyclic return to reactive origins. The positive solidarities that are built out of the process are hard-pressed to shake free from their reactive origins, whose mark they bear in the form of a will to judgment accompanied by a hardening of boundaries toward what is judged.
