AH: So thinking about the semblance as it arises in the aesthetic, it reminds me a lot of that phrase of Bergson’s: "a little nothing that is everything in a work of art." And in relation to aesthetics, because of its base in the interrelation of the senses, I imagine the semblance has a very strong relationship to the invisible, to the untouchable, to the silent. But I’m wondering if it’s not previously figured in many ways in art history and aesthetics, and two immediate examples where it might be found would be in the ghostly, and in the sublime, the presentation of the unpresentable. But the semblance seems more promising in relation to both, because it is something that really thinks the imperceptible, not just through sight, but through the senses and phenomena of the whole organism, the whole human animal.
