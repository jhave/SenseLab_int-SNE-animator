The reason I don't think it works as well for the public is because the effects I'm describing require long duration. They come from the ritualization and repetition â€“ how the piece iterates internally to its own performance. Some people from the public stay for several hours, or come back several times, but most participants stick their head in and leave. They don't stay long enough to get any sense of what manner of event it is. The other thing is that the mechanisms for interpellating the public to speak more often clam them up. It's very intimidating for a lot of people, and when we did it, most people weren't able to respond. But if they stayed, you could often sense them itching to speak, and if you went back to them they did participate. In any case, there is something unresolved in the piece having to do with the performer-public dynamic that left a number of the performers I was in it with feeling that it wasn't really working.
