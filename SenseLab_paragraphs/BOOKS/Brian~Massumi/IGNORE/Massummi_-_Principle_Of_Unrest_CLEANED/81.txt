This is where accelerationist notions might be helpful. It is perhaps possible to identify tendencies toward excess in the way capitalism itself is working, and help push them over the edge of one of its ulterior limits. It is along these lines that accelerationists Alex Williams and Nick Srnicek are thinking, but within a very different theoretical framework (their call for a "Promethean politics of maximal self-mastery over society and the environment" is obviously going in very different directions from the ones I am suggesting; Williams and Srnicek 2014: 360).
