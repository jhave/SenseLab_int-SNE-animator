BM: The call to focus on the question of the qualititative in movement is a proposal to return to the question of value, radically rethought outside programmatic politics or normative ethics. To concede the question of value to capitalism, moralism, or conformism is to lose the battle before it begins. Any democracy-to-come will arrive as a collective embodiment of emergent intensities of experience whose living-out is its own value, immanent to that live event, before they are encasted in any institutional armature, and with the tendency to push across and overspill any regularizing or regulatory incorporation, in a perpetual cycle of stabilizing capture and revivifying escape.
