It is a key proposition of the SenseLab that the intensest expression is impersonal and collective in the environmental sense glossed in this essay, where "collective" ceases to be a synonym for a collection of individuals to become the sign-function pointing to the effective potential in the situation that exceeds both the individuals in the group and their aggregate number â€“but cannot come to expression without them, through their finitude. "Collective" in this sense is the quaesitum: that which must be sought in any event of expression if it is to fulfill its Object (in such a way that it pragmatically becomes all but one with the commensal Subject of expression).
