The only option, then, is to let, or encourage, the movements of capitalism push themselves to the point of no return. This is an interesting position, but it ignores the qualitative points I started out with: not only are there qualitatively different kinds of movement, but movement as displacement is but the visible index of qualitative variation. It also presupposes certain ideas about the nature of capitalism. To say that there is no outside of capitalism so that everything we do is "inside" it, is implicitly to construe it as a structure: a set of interacting elements whose functioning delineates a bounded space of operation. The accelerationist will counter that the point is just the opposite: capitalism operates in the unbounded space of its own universality, and that is precisely why everything we do is in it. But this riposte is based on a logical flaw.
