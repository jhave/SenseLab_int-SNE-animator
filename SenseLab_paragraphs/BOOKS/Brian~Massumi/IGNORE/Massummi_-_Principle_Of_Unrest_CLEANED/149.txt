BM: From my point of view events are always happening. They swarm. The cut of the event is everywhere, all the time, most often in ways that it is possible to neglect, because the regularities of life pick up again right away, and retroactively smooth over the interruption. Benjamin Libet's famous experiments show how conscious perception "back-dates" decisions that set in on the nonconscious level of bare activity to make it seem as if the individual "I" had made them, when it wasn't even there. Only its dividuality was. "I" had been momentarily shattered, disappearing into the schizz, falling back into bare activity, for an instantaneous beat in the pulse of life. This means that the breaking-and-entering of the strange intruder is also endemic to perception. It is as constititutional as the tendency for the "I" to emerge, and continually re-emerge to smooth over its eventful blanking out. Perception blinks. Consciousness "flickers," as Whitehead said. Peirce's theory of the strange intruder is a theory of perception, emphasizing perception's overfullness with non-I experience.
