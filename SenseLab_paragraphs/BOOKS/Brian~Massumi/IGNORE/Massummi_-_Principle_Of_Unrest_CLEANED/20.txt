BM: The speed of contemporary movements is indeed a factor, but speed is not adequate as a diagnostic tool. It is inadequate in light of what I was just saying about displacement being the index of a movement of qualitative change. Speed and acceleration are basically displacement concepts. They are quantitative notions referring to the rate of displacement. How many things and different kinds of things are catapulted into circulation by capital, and how fast they turn over, is the tip of the iceberg. The bulk of the issue is that there has been a qualitative change in how capitalism's movements move.
