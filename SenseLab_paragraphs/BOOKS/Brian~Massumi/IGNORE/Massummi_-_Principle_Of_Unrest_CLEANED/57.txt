Being "in" capitalism is a question of degrees of inclusion in its field. "Degrees" might still imply a quantitative distinction, but what I'm getting at is a qualitative difference: different, interacting logics corresponding to qualitatively different modes of relation. A for-profit prison feeds off of flows of capital. But it also feeds off of flows of criminality. The flows of criminality answer to a logic of infraction implying modes of relation that are not outside capitalism, but are not reducible to the capitalist relation. Each such logic constitutes its own mode of relation corresponding to a qualitatively different degree of inclusion in the neoliberal fold. The model is of symbiosis: formations that are incorporated in a larger assemblage and serve its global logic, but at the same time retain a certain heterogeneity.
