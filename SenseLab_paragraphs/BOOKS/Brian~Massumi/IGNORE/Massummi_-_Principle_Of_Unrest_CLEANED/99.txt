KW: Today the notion of flow and the notion of real-time flow have become commonplace.  The rise of digitality for instance hinges upon this idea to the degree that people believe in instantaneous online communication without ever understanding that the movement of data never works without interruptions. Ideally, there is just-in-time delivery of data, but never real-time transmission. However the illusion is uncontested. Moreover it seems to be attributed to any type of movement today (the movement of underclass migrants being an exception). Is this illusion a symptom of the general misrecognition of how infrastructure for movement is actually built and how power permeates it?
