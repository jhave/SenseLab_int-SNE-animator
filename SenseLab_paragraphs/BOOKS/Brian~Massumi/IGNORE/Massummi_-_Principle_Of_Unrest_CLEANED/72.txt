BM: It means that there is a surfeit of potentials that are immanent to capitalism's field but not inside its system. There is always an excess of activity afoot that has not been mobilized into action. There is always an excess of potentials (puissances) suggesting themselves but are not yet channeled into the exercise of powers (pouvoirs). There is no outside of capitalism in the sense that, in its tireless displacement of its immanent limit, there is nowhere it cannot go potentially. It is virtually everywhere. The attractor of the capitalist relation is tendentially space-filling. It is by nature imperialistic. It is universal by vocation. Processually speaking, however, it is awaft in a great outside of bare activity. It is hard to describe the "exteriority" of this field of germinal life, because we have no words for a nonspatial domain. As it is used here, the word "outside" is directly processual and lacks a spatial connotation, so in a sense it is arbitrary to call it that. We're talking about what Blanchot and Deleuze called an absolute outside, more radically open than any mere exterior defined as such relative to the enclosure of an interior. An immanent outside: the in-which of all that stirs forth.
