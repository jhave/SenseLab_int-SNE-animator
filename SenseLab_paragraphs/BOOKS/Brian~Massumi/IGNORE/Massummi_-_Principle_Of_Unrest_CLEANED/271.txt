It is a peculiarity of SenseLab not to seek these "internal" factors as such. This is a general principle of SenseLab activities, in all their forms-of-fact and phases. To seek these factors would be to impress them into the individual: bring them out from their potential environmentality and limit them to the individual subjectivity of the utterer/interpeter. This would be to personalize expression again, at the expense of the infinity of potentiality that the movement of thought-expresson is capable of mobilizing if it is pressurized pragmatically in Peirce's speculative sense, through the thirdness of free indirect discourse. At the limit, it is the process of free indirect discourse that is the autonomous Subject of expression all but one with the environmental Object of thought extending into potential (Commind). To personalize this process is to diminish the environmental force of the sign-power of semiosis, whose determination to be determined can only be unleashed if the autonomy of that expression is valued, cared for situationally, and tended to transsituationally with technique. The personal is an interiorizing limitation of that autonomy. Vološinov made the point that expression is in any case only ever personal secondarily. The interiority of the individual speaking subject is the result of signs being "inwardly impelled" by specific techniques of power" (Vološinov 1986: 153). In this, he prefigures Foucault's conviction that the interiorization and personalization of the individual subject is the product of certain historically specific strategies of power. To the extent to which we speak in the first person, rather than the unspecified third person of free indirect discourse, we express not our subjective freedom, but the history of the subjection of expression.
