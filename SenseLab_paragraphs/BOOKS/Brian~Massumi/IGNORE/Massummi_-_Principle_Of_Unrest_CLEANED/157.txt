2) Micropolitics cannot be separated from macropolitics. It is not the not opposite of macropolitics, but rather their underside: associated with what Moten and Harney call the "undercommons." An action always straddles both levels, even if it is oblivious to its participation in the minor. All acts are duplicitous, participating in both dimensions at the same time, but not with the same effects. It's a kind of aparallel, double-inscription, on correlated but divergent tracks. A corollary of this is that micropolitics, while necessary, is not self-sufficient. Minor gestures always have to play the major, subverting, perverting, hijacking, or hacking it. And however dismissive I can be about the grand gestures of macropolitics, they, like the ressentiment of anti-racist identity-based politics, are strategically necessary at certain junctures.
