BM: No, there is no outside to movement. As Erin Manning points out in her book Relationscapes (2009), even stillness is composed of movements. Standing still is a dynamic balance achieved through liminally perceptible micromovements of muscles and attention. In physics, the vacuum is abuzz with dark energy and teams with cosmic rays. As Bergson maintained, there is no such thing as immobility. There are only regimes of movement of qualitatively different kinds whose manners of combining and disjoining compose motional-relational fields. Objects are coagulations of these fields: motional-relational knots that come to stand out as saliencies against the background activity from which they arise and which continues to sustain them for as long as they endure: objects are movement field-effects. The same could be said of situations and events, and even logics (which always arise from and express themselves through patterns of movement).
