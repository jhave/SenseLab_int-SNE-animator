KW: Could you explain more about the idea of objective illusion or necessary, constitutive error? Which role does it play in your philosophy of perception?
 
BM: It is easy to grasp using one of Whitehead's favorite examples. We sometimes look into a mirror and mistake what is reflected from behind us as being laid out in front of us. This illusion is the objective result of the conditions of perception. The perception truly expresses the misleading conditions. Objective illusions are truly embedded in the world. It is just that they do not always truly embody the consequences of the actions that might be carried out as a result. If we reach our hand forward, we will not touch the objects in the mirror. When our reach is frustrated, we immediately adjust our perception. This at the same time readjusts the field of the muscular movements that are poised to come, already tendentially present in activated potential (what I call the proprioceptive body-without-an-image). The perception we began with is still there. The illusion, because it is objective, cannot be dispelled. But it can be resituated in a more complex relational field in a way that supplements the perception with an immediate, embodied understanding of the potentials brewing.
