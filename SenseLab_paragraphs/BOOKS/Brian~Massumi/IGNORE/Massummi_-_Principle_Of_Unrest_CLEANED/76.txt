Processual duplicity requires a rethinking of the limits of capitalism. Earlier, I set out some traditional Marxist terms. My definition of the capitalist relation was the basic, text-book Marxist definition. But the concepts started to stray from traditional Marxist vocabulary. For example, traditionally Marxists would say that the limit of capitalism is property. In the schema I have just presented, property is not the absolute processual limit of capitalism, which is rather capitalism's trucking with its own immanent outside. Private property is the absolute systemic limit of capitalism. What marks a movement's entry into the capitalist system is its gaining the possibilty of being designated as property, or of feeding in some way or another the accumulation of property. Property is one of the requisite conditions for the capitalist system, the enterprise-form being another, and quantifiability (the standardization of measure and accounting) yet another (this is not an exhaustive list). The capitalist system is a way of building upon these conditions in combination, in intrication. No one of them in isolation is adequate to its definition as a system. But property is the linch-pin. Were the property form to crumble, the capitalist system would surely crumble with it. It might also crumble should one of its co-conditions be withdrawn, in such a way that its removal rebounded upon the property form. Capitalism would have hit its limit as a system. An absolute systemic limit of this kind can be called an ulterior limit: a threshold across which the capitalist system falls out of itself. This could conceivably occur from capitalism pushing certain of its own movements too far, so that it falls out its own far side â€“ at which point it is swallowed back into its everywhere immanent limit (which, in a topological processual torsion, folds around, the great outside coinciding with the beyond of the far side).
