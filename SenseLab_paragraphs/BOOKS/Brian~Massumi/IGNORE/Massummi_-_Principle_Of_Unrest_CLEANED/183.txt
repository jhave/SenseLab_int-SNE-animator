AH: You mentioned philosophy’s relation to non-philosophy, and I was immediately surprised that one can think of forms of thought or action that could be deemed purely non-philosophical. Tracking back to the question of your relation to philosophy itself, within a broader context of knowledge production, one of the things that your writing practice is doing is opening new facings, or encounters with other fields of knowledge making: the sciences, the social sciences, cultural studies, the arts. This is partly about de-hierarchizing the relation between philosophy and these fields, given their historical formations, but it is also about making philosophy more connective, more felt, and more "grounded," in both its pragmatic and ecological sense. You challenge long-installed distinctions in intellectual life: between the empirical and the speculative, common sense and experimentation, "hard" and "soft" thinking, as it were. So I’m wondering do you have a field statement in relation to philosophy itself ? What of philosophy needs to be disowned, and what affirmed?
