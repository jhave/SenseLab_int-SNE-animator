To say that these formations are "capitalist" is not untrue, but it it is not sufficient, since each also has its own operating logic. They must of course bend to the logic of capital. They are fed by capital and under neoliberalism are allowed to prosper only if they in turn feed the capitalist economy, providing something that can be considered an "added value" for it. Under neoliberalism, the raison d'être of everything is justified in economic terms. Even so, these formations are not simply "capitalist." A for-profit prison in the United States is capitalist – but it is still also carceral. It participates in two logics, capitalism and carcerality. Overall, it answers to a fuzzy logic: one that allows for partial belonging in more than one set.
