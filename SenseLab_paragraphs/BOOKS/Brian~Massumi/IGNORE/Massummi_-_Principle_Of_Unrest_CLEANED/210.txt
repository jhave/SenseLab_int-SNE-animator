AH: Can I ask you about Tino Sehgal in that regard? In many ways Sehgal’s work seems to embody that particular tension between the dynamics of capture by capital and some potential movement, or escape velocity out of capital. You performed in Sehgal’s This Situation recently here in Montreal: a piece that convenes a scene of public discourse on debates in critical thought and philosophy. One of the questions there, in terms of this tension with modes of capture, is around the nature of the convening of a space of public discourse: to what extent that space falls into generic formulae of discursive exchange, and therefore into a sanctioned knowledge economy? Or to what extent it can carry or hold a rather amorphous, constantly evolving, differentiating space of discourse? Does that resonate with your experience of making this work?
