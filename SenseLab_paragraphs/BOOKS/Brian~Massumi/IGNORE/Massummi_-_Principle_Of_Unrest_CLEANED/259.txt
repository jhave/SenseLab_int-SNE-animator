The Object of the sign is the "quaesitum" ("that which must be sought;" Peirce 1998: 406). The quaesitum is the terminus of the expressive movement that orients the process powered by the sign. It is an attractor pole lying at the limit of the movement of sense-making – semiosis, the movement of thought-expression – but at the same time dynamizes it from within, as that toward which the movement tends. It exerts a formative force on the process, operating immanently to it.
