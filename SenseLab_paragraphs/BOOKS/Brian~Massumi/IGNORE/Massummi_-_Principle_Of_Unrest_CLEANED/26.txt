BM: "Infra-" is a prefix I like to use to refer to the immanent level at which potentials of emergence are found. As my two examples indicate, the immanence of the infra-, and the manner in which it is accessed and to what effect, is highly variable. An extraction of surplus-value from an infra-level is not a manufacture. Financial surplus-value comes from capital's becoming self-abstracting as a function of its own flow, hoisting itself on its own soulful petards into another realm of its being. Biotechnological reembodiments, for their part, are more grown than manufactured â€“ they are less made than made to take form, by manipulating how potentials come to express themselves. On the infra-level what is at issue is a veritable becoming, a bringing into determinate existence of something prefigured only on the run, in the upswell of as-yet unformed potential. Modulating or manipulating what comes of this level constitutes an extreme form of power: the power to bring to be; the power to make become; the power to harness qualitative transformation. I call it ontopower ("onto" from "ontogenesis," or the process of being's becoming).
