What real-time refers to is really the point at which the delay in transmission becomes negligible, where it ceases to be a noticeable factor. This is a relational reality, having to do with how different durations meet, across differences in scale. Real-time is when the duration of transmission becomes negligible in relation to durations on the scale of human perception â€“ which are themselves relational realities bound up with the larger culturally inflected movements of changing expectations, habits of attention, and perceptual orientations. Real-time is a fiction, but at the same time it is a practical reality. There is always a selling point at which a technology can claim to operate with a delay that is as good as real-time for that particular cultural conjuncture. Real-time is really just-in-time.
