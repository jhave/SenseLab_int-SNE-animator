But in a second moment, something else happens. Because right at that moment, of intensest creativity, philosophy falls out of itself, into an absolute proximity with other modes of activity. It's maybe easier to see what I mean using another example, say the senses. What can vision do best, what can it do that no other sense modality can do? I would say, colour. Touch can do form and outline, in its own way, but colour is untouchable. Yet where colour is operating most intensely, say in color field painting, there is suddenly a sense of movement in colour. Vision has taken up into itself another sense modality. Kinesthesia, which in its own mode is invisible, has become visible. And at the same time, vision has become kinesthetic. A similar thing happens when philosophy reaches the limit of what it can do. When it brings the futurity in the present to expression, it's verging on the emergence of new contexts. What is that, if not political? Or at least proto-political. Couched in those dawning contexts are new forms of perception, new modes of experience. And what is that, if not aesthetic, or at least proto-aesthetic? If the emphasis, for example, is on new experiences of space, philosophy is absorbed in becoming architectural – at the same time architecture is absorbed in becoming philosophical. It's a two-way transformation, where the culmination of one mode of activity opens out onto another, or others, in a shared state of renewal. The non-philosophical – the political, the aesthetic, everyday modes of experience, other disciplines – reasserts and renews itself at the end of a successful philosophical run. The activity of philosophy starts and ends with the non-philosophical.
