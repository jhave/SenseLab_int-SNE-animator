That is: life's field of exteriority. The emergent tendencies are brought into the fold, and take on a contributing function. In themselves – that is to say, in their own adventitious emergence – they are uncontained. They are emergently outside. Their agitation forms a great outside of emergence, understood not in a spatial sense, but in the processual sense of bare, background activity, arising, in-coming, passionally, out of immanence. The formations they feed into demarcate the inside of capitalism, understood as a complex array of interacting structures and systems, each of which is a relative outside to the others, and all of which together, in their interactions and reciprocal standing apart, distinguish themselves from the great outside of bare, tendential activity.
