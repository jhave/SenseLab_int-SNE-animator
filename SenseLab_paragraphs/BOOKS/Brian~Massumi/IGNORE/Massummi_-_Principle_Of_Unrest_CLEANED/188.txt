AH: In your recent writing, the idea of the event has been very important and I take from that the notion that an event is something elementally transformational. It is something singular; something old and new, continuous and discontinuous, at the same time. But it is also extinguished, it evaporates, it disappears. I’m wondering how this notion of event relates to the everyday, and to the mundane even [dog barking] – and there it is! It was a mundane event. Now we don’t even need to do the discourse. [laughter] If one thinks in this way one sees, then, event everywhere. But for there to be an event at all doesn’t there need to be a bracketing around that event? There would need to be a constitutive zone or condition of the uneventful? Is there then an event of the mundane or even of the banal?
