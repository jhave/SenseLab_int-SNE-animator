AH: The vitality affect of the event, and its relation to history, has been a very big problem for performance art. For such a long time performance was associated with presence, with a presentational force as opposed to a representational order, and so the document, the archive, historiography, etc. were seen as suspect iterations in relation to the force of the event. But that has led a lot of people to say this is really reifying the event; entangling it with "the authentic," putting a lot of pressure and investment into very specific qualities of the event, which may be re-performed in other representational forms. So we move from trying to think about the ontology of performance as absolutely founded in disappearance, towards an ontogenetic model where performance is recurring iteratively, proliferating differences through multiple forms.
