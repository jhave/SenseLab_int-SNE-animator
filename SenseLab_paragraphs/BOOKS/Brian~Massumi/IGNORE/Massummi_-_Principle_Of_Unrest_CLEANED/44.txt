If this is possible, it is only by acting directly in the register of affect. No amount of ideological analysis or persuasion will do the trick, because programmatic politics is as implicated in structures of representation and identity as liberal democracy is, although from a different angle (for example, in the guise of the "will of the people" as spear-headed by a vanguard, explicitly or in the implicit form of a technocratic elite). The counter-tendencies I'm talking about are just as moving, just as emergent and, ultimately, just as self-driving as the machine of capitalism itself â€“ only with a different, non-monetary, directly qualitative sense of value. That is a sense of the value of movements, events, relations, in and for themselves, a sense of aliveness, the sense of intensity that comes with the experience of potential. These unmonetarizable surplus-values of movement feedback into themselves, in their own currency of experienced potential, sketching alter-economies of transformational relation. They are tendentially anti-capitalist counter-ontopowers immanent to the capitalist field.
