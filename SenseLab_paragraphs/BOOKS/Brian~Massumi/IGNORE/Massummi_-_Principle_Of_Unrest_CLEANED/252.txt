This is the cross-practice equivalent of free indirect discourse. Thinking self-reports cross-wise. It "says" itself multiply, across words and movement (and images and sounds; and bodily gesture and verbalization). But through that multiplicity, it says itself of a single process of "absolutely" original articulation: a creative movement, single in its occurrence. For the SenseLab, this transductive relay, this singular cross-articulate expression of thought eventfully self-reporting, is what best characterizes what research-creation can do.
