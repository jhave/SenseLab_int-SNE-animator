When I started developing my own writing practice, this lesson stayed with me. I was very influenced by that exercise of ventriloquizing other people’s style through translation. I started to pay a lot of attention to the movement of my own writing. There's a point when I'm composing where the movement starts to take over and I begin to feel that instead of me thinking the concepts, the movement is thinking them through me. The concepts are fielding themselves, step by step, pulse by pulse. There’s a certain sense of abandon, or perhaps surrender. But it's a surrender to the intensity of a movement of thought in the making, with all its precision – which in the way I mean it includes the way the text manages its ambiguities and distributes inflections. It became very intuitive to me, the notion that thought is a force that moves through personal enunciation, rather than being contained in it.
