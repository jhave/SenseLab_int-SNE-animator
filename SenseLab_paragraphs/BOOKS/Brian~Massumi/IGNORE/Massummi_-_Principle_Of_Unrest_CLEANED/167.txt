BM: Yes, the fact that it was the US decision to preemptively invade that made Iraq a breeding ground for terrorism is treated as if it is beside the point. All it means is that the invasion multiplied the opportunities to fight terrorism. It successfully flushed out more threats. To be successful, preemptive attack has to be iterative, cyclically producing and attacking what it fights. Asymmetrical war is the Long War, with many rounds to go, and we shouldn't shrink from it. By this logic, what was wrong was not Bush's invasion of Iraq, but Obama's unwillingness to follow through to the end in Iraq and Afghanistan and to up the ante by invading Syria. His preemptive strategy went drone-ward instead: toward the preemptive war equivalent of the minor gesture (all but imperceptible on the systemic level, liminally war-waging, leveraging surplus-values of the flow of surveillance information). In that direction, he was most willing and eager, becoming the kill-list president.
