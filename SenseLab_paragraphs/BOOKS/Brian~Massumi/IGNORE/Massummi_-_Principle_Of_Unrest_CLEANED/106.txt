BM: Philosophically, it points to the fact that the condition of possibility for every movement of deterritorialization is a reterritorialization. The deterritorialization has been enabled by the painstaking construction of an extensive apparatus for the facilitation of flows whose putting in place has required economic and political will and resources, and therefore stands as an expression of power. Every reterritorialization-deterritorialization constitutes its own space-time of power. Each such space-time is quantitatively as well as qualitatively different. But they conjoin across their difference. Differential flows of commodity goods, flows of human bodies, flows of networked images and information, conjoin in different manners to different effect, depending. The political question is how to act upon that "depending": how, relationally, to modulate the conjunctions.
