Nietzsche maintains that these durational creatures of the infra-individual primal crowd fight it out among themselves, or combine forces, and then as a consequence of this dynamic interrelating, issue in an action accompanied by a conscious perception. The interrelating cannot be limited to an interiority, because the elements in question are highly sensitive to perturbation. Their infra-individual domain is radically open to the outside. The infra-individual is a field of exteriority, in exactly the same way as the capitalist field (in fact, they entirely overlap, in partial belonging to one another, or in differential mutual inclusion, as I like to put it). The issuing into perception creates the objective illusion that, in Nietzsche's words, there are external multiplicities separable from the crowd, and that among them is to be found a culprit that can be singled out as the cause of any given unpleasant perturbation â€“ and in a sense, all of them are unpleasant, because perturbation is agitating, and agitation is restiveness and discomfiture. All perception resolves the unrest of an agitation on the level of bare activity. Because of this, it is necessary to call radically into question the "hedonic" categories of pleasure and pain, in favor of notions of intensity of activation and the fullness of that activation with potentials.
