The mining and monetization of this activity is labor, but again the yield that is arrived at is not commensurate with the work "invested" in the act of capture. The return is excessive. The exploitation is incommensurate, immeasurable. Automation in general, and in particular automation in the form of network-trawling self-executing algorithms, "leverage" life-forms in a similar manner to the way derivatives leverage debt. The leveraging in the financial markets can be by a factor twenty, and that is not considered high. It can run to hundreds of times the nominal value of the underlying assets.
