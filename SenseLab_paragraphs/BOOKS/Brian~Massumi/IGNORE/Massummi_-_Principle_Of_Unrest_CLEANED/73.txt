The distinction between activity and action makes it possible, in fact absolutely necessary, to affirm an activism against capitalism, and suggests that this can be done without automatically falling "into" its fold. This is not to say that is possible for any activity to remain outside it. In the great outside, there are no steady footholds. The absolute outside is a reserve of potential, not a place of refuge to hunker down in. The moment a line of flight begins to draw itself out, it begins to enter the institutional/quasi-insitutional landscape. Even if it succeeds in avoiding being captured by a particular formation, it is necessarily navigating the relative outside of the cracks between institutions, and that necessity inflects its course. It may also find itself in head-to-head confrontation, in which case it is immediately identified in the terms that particular formation uses to designate its unassimilable outside: enemy, criminal, deviant, refugee, free-loader. This nomination is in itself a partial assimilation, because it influences the arc of the movement of resistance. There is an ineluctable tendency for a counter-ontopowerful movement to fall into some form of complicity.
