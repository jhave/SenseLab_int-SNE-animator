Studies of priming in experimental psychology suggest that with every perceived threat there appears the horizon of death. Every threat comes with a tinge of existential threat. Certain political movements regularly capitalize on this tendency by mobilizing fear in relation to perceived threats associated with out-groups, treating them as existential threats regardless of their true proportions (or even whether they need to be treated as threats at all). Examples are too numerous to list, from the rhetoric of the right around the Brexit campaign to Donald Trump's wall against Mexico.
