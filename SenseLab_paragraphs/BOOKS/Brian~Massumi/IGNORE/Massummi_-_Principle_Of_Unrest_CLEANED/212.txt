In the case of This Situation, I think it’s actually a very different experience for the participants than for the performers. I can only talk about it from the performers' side, and I have a feeling that it succeeds more on that side. Just to explain briefly what it’s about. There’s a set of quotations from thinkers starting in the sixteenth century going forward on just the kinds of questions we've been discussing: the relation between the aesthetic and the political, between the aesthetic and the economic, between work and leisure, and on the nature of creativity. There are six performers in the room standing in set position against the walls. Everyone has memorized an assigned number of quotations. A performer pronounces a quotation at a moment of their choosing, introducing it with a stereotyped formula mentioning its date but not its author. Then everyone shifts positions in a predesignated pattern, and once they're in their new positions, there’s a discussion coming out of the quote. The positions are tableaux vivants gesturing to famous paintings in the European canon. The interaction is quite ritualized. As they are speaking, the performers are supposed to be gesturing nonstop at an excruciatingly slow pace in a rhythm that doesn’t match the rhythm of their speech. There are certain ways for interpellating the public in the gallery, inciting them to speak. The performers are instructed never to comment on the performance, even in response to a direct question about it from the public. Meta-reflection is forbidden. There are ritualized mechanisms for triggering a cut in the discussion and a move to a new position in order to deal with things like that without directly addressing them, just making the performance move past them.
