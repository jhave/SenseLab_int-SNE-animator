BM: It's crucial to return to that point here, in order to account for the possibility – I would call it a certainty – that in the field of emergence plied by the movements of capitalism there are emergent potentials for qualitatively different modes of existence that are stultified because –if they were allowed to take fully formed expression, if the budding tendencies they prefigure were to deploy and express themselves to their fullest power – they would move in directions beyond capitalism's orbit. In other words, on the infra-level of potential there are germinal stirrings of counter-powers of emergence. These are ontopowers immanent to capitalism's processual field, but as-yet uncaptured by its logic. When movements suddenly and inexplicably erupt, as happened in 2010-2011 and sporadically since, in one country after another, it is these potentials germinating and coming to a paroxysmic expression that suddenly calls everything into question, at times extending to capitalism itself, only to fizzle just as quickly they came. If we honed ways of understanding these countertendencies, perceiving them in germ, curating the traces of their passing in a way that makes them reactivatable, then perhaps we could coax them into taking more enduring form – or at least iterating more often, with more transformational relational overlaps, and as a result greater potential for contagion. Perhaps it is possible to extract counter-capitalist surplus-values of movement.
