Another prominent, very different, way in which capitalism has learned to valorize matrices of emergence is through biotechnology. Biotechnology, for its part, doesn't abstract the body away. It abstracts it into existence. It descends to the emergent material level of life, the gene, in order to manipulate the potentials of life's rearising. It operates on an infra-corporeal level. Capital, taking body emergently. The infra-corporeal level is a level that is "immanent" to existence: the well-spring from which it emerges like an artesian well feeding the many streams of life. It is the level of potential.
