processual effort, and shows no signs of losing speculative momentum. The “apolitical” may well be conservative, but the “conservative” Right can be outright radical.
Praising the aesthetico-political powers of language performance is in no way a dismissal of the power of other techniques of existence, in other registers, to produce virtual events of a political kind. The audiovisual image register is of arguably greater power today, thanks to the ever- intensifying integration of the activity of its “aliveness engines” into every aspect of life (through cable and satellite television, the Internet, cell phones, and all manner of digital platforms for their technical conver- gence). The important consideration is that all registers or modalities of experience already virtually contain each other in bud, and that all of the technologies contributing to the iterative production of their infinitely repeated events of variation, as well as all of the techniques of existence working through these technologies, only perform by forming nexuses of their coming-together to experiential effect. Politicality is always an eco- logical question of mutual inclusion which, given the infinity of elements on offer, is always vitally selective: involving an event-economy of taking- in and out-treating, to determinate experiential effect. The extent to which and the way in which the occurrent perceptual effects are determined to be human-channeled is a key evaluative variable. It is the variable that connects the processual ecology of forms of life to ecology in the environ- mentalist sense.
