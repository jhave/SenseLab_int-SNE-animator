Because your experience is tarrying in its nascency. This is powerfully suggestive, but nonspecifically. This should make a difference. Could make a difference. But how? Which difference? Could/should: specu- lative. How/which?: pragmatic. Walking down the street has rebecome speculatively pragmatic, in a way that is immediately thought-felt. The artwork has already made a difference. An incipient difference, in the dynamic form of a semblance of an ecological truth. What is left is to see how or if it will continue to play out, taking-in other elements, playing- on other familiarities, conventions, articulate readings, immediating its way out and down world-lines yet to be invented.
