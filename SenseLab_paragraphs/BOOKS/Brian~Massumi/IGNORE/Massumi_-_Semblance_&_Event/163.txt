The ability of a manner of movement to achieve qualitative autonomy in repetition means that the double existence perceived in every change of state extends into a double ordering of the world. On the one hand, it is possible to follow the life-paths of objects as they move visibly from one combination to another, and from one event to another. This serial, objec- tive ordering, hinged on the visible form of the object, is what Michotte calls a “world-line” (Michotte 1963, 16–17). World-lines bring identity to difference: the object’s visible form is recognizably conserved across the series of events composing its historic route.
It happens all the time that we jump from one world-line to another, re-feeling an activation contour in its migratory independence as it reap- pears in different objective combinations, from balls to cars to any number of other things. It is possible to jump world-lines to “yoke extremely diverse events” in perceptual feeling (Stern 1985, 58). This yoking can operate across great distances in objective time and space. A nonsensuous linkage, through its resemblance to itself, can bring an extreme diversity of situations into proximity with each other according to the quality of movement—the activation contour or shape of change—they nonsensu- ously share.  The nonsensuous  similarity between  distant events  brings changes—differencings—qualitatively together. World-lines bring identity to difference. Nonsensuous similarity between world-lines bring differenc- ings together. The yoking of events through nonsensuous similarity brings
