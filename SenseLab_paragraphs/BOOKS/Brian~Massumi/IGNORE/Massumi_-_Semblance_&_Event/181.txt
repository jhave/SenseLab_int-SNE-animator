Language gives voice to the archive. It makes it possible to move and share felt relations at any distance from the sensuous object-forms they yoke. Words are by nature nonlocally linked to their formal meaning, since they can be repeated anywhere and anytime. Words also yoke to other words, in a “chain of derivations . . . whereby the local relations” and their sense- perceived meanings may in the end be “entirely lost.” At the limit, lan- guage can “suppress intermediate links” and operate only with nonlocal linkages (Whitehead 1985, 83). It was said earlier that it was possible to jump from one world-line to another. Language makes it possible to jump world-lines, or jump ahead on a world-line, skipping over objectively nec- essary intermediate steps. Language is the very technique of skipping intermediaries. Skipped “intermediaries” is also a concept James uses in connection with the affective/qualitative-relational order of felt abstrac- tion with which language operates (James 1996a, 175; James 1978, 247–248).
What is the directly perceived “self-detachment” of a nonsensuous similarity from a set of objective conditions if not a lived abstraction? What is lived abstraction if not thought? Language, skipping intermediaries, takes up the thought-felt abstraction of nonsensuous experience into its own movement. This intensifies the autonomy of nonsensuous perception by incalculably increasing the range of its potential yoking between extremely diverse events. “The paths that run through conceptual experiences, that is, through ‘thoughts’ or ‘ideas’ that ‘know’ the things in which they ter- minate, are highly advantageous paths to follow. Not only do they yield inconceivably rapid transitions; but, owing to the ‘universal’ character which they frequently possess, and to their capacity for association with
