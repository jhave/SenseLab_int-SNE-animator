Comparison involves a Thirdness. A mediating third term is abstract in much the way a Platonic form is: ideally still, glossing over the chaos and the jitter. Except that it takes the gloss to a higher level. It raises the mediation of figures off their shared surface to a space of judgment hover- ing above. The standard hovers unseen in a thought-space above the surface of perception. It is a height of generality. It is a general paragon. It is ideal. As an ideal, it is not so much overseen as it is overseeing. It oversees the correctness of the assessment.
The space of comparison is a normative space of ideal Thirdness rising above. What goes up, can come down. Instead of an oval, draw a cube. Project it onto a ground-level chaos. A razed plot of urban land, say. Think of its form as an abstract sieve to filter the chaos. Then concretize the form. Build a building according to its standard. The standard of comparison has now returned to earth, as a constructive model. It has gone actively to ground. A plot-size of selected abstract potential has been poured in con- crete. Now it is a concrete ground for moving through and around. What ambient arrays, what edgings in, what potential crossings and connections, what glossings over, what identities and orderings will emerge from the movement it standardizes? An architect has modeled a building. The build- ing itself now takes the baton, and models a plot-sized slice of life.
