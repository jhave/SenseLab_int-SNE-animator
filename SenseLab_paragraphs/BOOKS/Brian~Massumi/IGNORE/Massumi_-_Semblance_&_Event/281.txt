of cultural mediation enter as directly into the ecological nexus as any other element. In becoming-immanent to the event of expression, they become immediate contributory forces. They are immediated. It is no con- tradiction to say that the experiential effect is directly and immediately felt following its own immanent rhythm, and to note the degree to which cultural convention and codings contribute to its eventuating. It is only because the viewer is familiar with the conventional layout of a room and with the architectural codes of gallery buildings that this process is able to occur. Both the initial throwing-off of perception upon entry into the room, and the final determination of the singularity of the room, depend on this familiarity. The experiential eventâ€™s playing-out plays on the very conventions, articulate readings, and ingrained habits that the experimen- tation with painting had so concertedly filtered out.
