Abstract art frees the line from representation, as radically as possible. In doing so, it frees vision from the task of having to depart from realistic content, as well as freeing it to forego personification. Its lines (and con- trasts, and color fields) double the sensuous surface of the canvas or paper with a sense of movement perceptually felt in vision, but not continuing “behind” anything else or “beyond” where it goes. Pure activity of vision, stirring itself, but going absolutely nowhere other than with this visual event, stalling any possibility of a pointing-toward a something or particu- lar someone beyond its own occurrence. Vision self-detaching into its own virtual event: semblance of seeing. Semblance of a truth of vision.
Abstract art returns vision kinesthetically to its own self-creative activ- ity. Vision is remitted to the felt activity of its coming eventfully into itself: a proprioception of vision. Pure visual activity, at the absolute vanishing point where it enters a zone of indistinction with thought, from which its action is ever renascent. Pure thinking-seeing, perceptually felt. The abstract opening of vision onto thought is purely dynamic. It brooks no closure. Unspatialized, eschewing content; neither containing nor contained. “The unlimited returns” (Deleuze 1990, 7).10
Any technique of existence can be de-limited (as the figural does for drawing or painting), or unlimited (as abstraction does for all of the plastic
