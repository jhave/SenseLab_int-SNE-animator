The adult is not so different from the child. More than a hundred years before mirror neurons were discovered, James observed that every percep- tion of a movement directly “awakens in some degree the actual movement” perceived (James 1950, 526). “Every possible feeling,” James continues, “produces a movement, and that movement is a movement of the entire organism, and of each of its parts” (372). “A process set-up any- where reverberates everywhere” (381). Whitehead similarly sites an instan- taneous, all-absorbing “reenaction” as the initial phase of every occasion (Whitehead 1967a, 192–194; Whitehead 1978, 237–238, 245). In what we call thinking, the acting out of the movement is inhibited, resulting in what Bergson calls a “nascent action,” or “virtual movement.” The nascent action is the thought; thought is virtual movement (Bergson 1988, ch. 1). Point, virtual counterpoint. The difference between the infant and the adult is that the adult is capable of refraining from acting out its nascent actions. The accomplishment of the adult is to gurgle virtually to a soothing.
If we apply this to the examples of object perception used earlier, where there seemed to be an implicit presupposition of a passive subject observ- ing a scene, it is now clear that the “spectator” was as directly involved as
