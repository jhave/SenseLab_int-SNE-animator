They may well be depoliticizing—not in spite of their content but because of their stating it. But this should not be prejudged solely on the basis of the form the use of language takes. It is important not to prejudge according to any preset criteria, especially the speculative-pragmatic ones. For the issue for this approach is not the form of the work per se (its recognized genre or conventional gestures), nor even its pointing outside itself toward extra- event content as such. Whatever elements enter the event, the issue is the force of their becoming immanent to it, toward the self-detachment of a fusional effect having a dynamic form and affective tonality, animate quality and intensity, singularly-generically its own. Whether the work has this depends not on the “what” of the different elements that enter, but on the “how” of their differential coming-together. This cannot be prejudged, only experienced. The ways in which the conditions have been prepared will have a lot to say about it performatively. The strategies of composing-away and composing-with, and the economy of their mutual coming together (and holding part), will also be determining. The mere presence of statement says nothing of semblance. It must be remembered always that evaluative “criteria” are just that—criteria for evaluation, not rules of judgment. The criteria suggested here are heuristic devices for evaluating the aesthetic intensity and politicality of an expressive event. The evaluation bears on the occurrent singularity of the process, not on the value of the product by any conventional measure or yardstick of taste or correctness. If these be rules, they are rules of thumb, not instructions for finger pointing.
