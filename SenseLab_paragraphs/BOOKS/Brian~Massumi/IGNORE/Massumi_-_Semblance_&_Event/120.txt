“I was in a totally white room. As I held the prism before my eyes, I expected, keeping Newtonian theory in mind, that the entire white wall would be fragmented into different colors, since the light returning to the eye would be seen shattered in just so many colored lights. But I was quite amazed that the white wall showing through the prism remained as white as before. Only where there was something dark did a more or less distinct color show. . . . It required little thought to recognize that an edge was necessary to bring about color. I immediately spoke out to myself, through instinct, that Newtonian theory was erroneous. . . . Everything unfolded itself before me bit by bit. I had placed a white sheet of glass upon a black background, looking at it through the prism from a given distance, thus representing the known spectrum and completing Newton’s main experi- ment with the camera obscura. But a black sheet of glass atop a light, white ground also made a colored, and to a certain degree a gorgeous specter. Thus when light dissolves itself in just so many colors, then darkness must also be viewed as dissolved in color” (Goethe 1972, 35; emphasis added).
