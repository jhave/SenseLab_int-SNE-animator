Something’s doing (James 1996a, 161). That much we already know. Some- thing’s happening. Try as we might to gain an observer’s remove, that’s where we find ourselves: in the midst of it. There’s happening doing. This is where philosophical thinking must begin: immediately in the middle (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 21–23, 293).
What’s middling in all immediacy is “an experience of activity” (James 1996a, 161). “The fundamental concepts are activity and process” (Whitehead 1968, 140). “Bare activity, as we may call it, means the bare fact of event or change” (James 1996a, 161).
In bare point of fact, that is where everything, not just philosophy, begins. “Activity and change” are “the matter of fact” (Whitehead 1968, 146). “‘Change taking place’ is a unique content of experience” (James 1996a, 161). The unique content of experience: “the sense of activity is in the broadest and vaguest way synonymous with life. . . . To be at all is to be active. . . . We are only as we are active” (James 1996a, 161–162). To begin to think life, we must begin in the middle with an activist sense of life at no remove: in the middling immediacy of its always “going on” (James 1996a, 161).1
Whitehead’s term for his own activist philosophy at no remove from life’s immediacy is “process philosophy.” For Whitehead, activity, as event or change synonymous with life, entails a further concept. “The notion of potentiality is fundamental for the understanding of existence, as soon as the notion of process is admitted. . . . Immediacy is the realization of the potentialities of the past, and is the storehouse of the potentialities of the future” (Whitehead 1968, 99–100; emphasis added). To be at all is to be active in a “production of novelty” consisting in the “transformation of the potential into the actual” (Whitehead 1968, 151). The “principle of
