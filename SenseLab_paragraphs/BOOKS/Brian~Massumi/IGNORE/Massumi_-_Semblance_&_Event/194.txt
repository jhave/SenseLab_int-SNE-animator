permutation ability built into the operation of language expands the world’s repertory of nonlocal linkage to a degree that sensuous forms could never achieve linearly following the world-lines of their actual encounters. The ambulatory potential that language also has to foretrace world-lines gives pure thought a pragmatic issue in the actual world that it does not have on its own. Being infinitely recessive, left to its own devices it moves farther and farther in the other direction, toward furthest horizons of amodal reality. Without language—or a nonverbal resonation machine for virtual events (of which, as we will see, there are many)—the archive of experience would be full of nothing appearing to the absolute limit, without so much as a semblance. Void of thought.
The inventive power of language depends on techniques of existence: techniques to channel the activity of pure thought toward an issue in the sensuous world, through which the world becomes. Speech is one such technique. Writing is another. The differences between them as techniques of existence are crucial to take into account, but are beyond the purview of this essay, which has a date with the weather to keep.
