José Gil speaks of a “paradox” of the dancing body (Gil 2006). Quite simply, it is that dance has to continually return to the body in order to newly depart from it, to creative effect. Similarly, a universe of music only comes in offset from performing bodies. A nonsensuous linkage of any kind is a lived abstraction from a combination of sensuous forms. The objective order of actuality and the qualitative-relational universe of the virtual shadow each other at every step. They are fraternal twins, separatively connected at birth by the umbilicus of creative advance. Dimensions of each other. Pulses of the same movements. Poles of the one process of the many comings-together to singular effect. Double ordering never ends. Double existence, always, in all ways.
