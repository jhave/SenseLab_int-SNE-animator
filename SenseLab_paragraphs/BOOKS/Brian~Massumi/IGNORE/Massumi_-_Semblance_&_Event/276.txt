breath away from a “becoming involved” again with the actual space of the environment around the painting (99). His nonobject art was now ready to move out. It had enfolded into its own event, and now it was ready for its event to unfold and go walkabout. This is not as difficult in principle as it might seem. After all, the effect that detonates when the differentials of the elemental relational field fusionally “take” is nonlocal. It shouldn’t be such a stretch to spread its nonlocality, so that its “taking” takes-in further differentials.
So Irwin now started adding. More elements, for an expanding rela- tional field. He got rid of the canvas and frame, and attached discs directly to the wall. Objectness was back. Even the line became materialized in some disc experiments as an actual material band across the disc. He also added lighting: angles of illumination intersecting across the disc just so. The effect was the same energizing of vision as before. But now the art nonobject was perceptually felt to be detaching itself from the wall into the surrounding space. You couldn’t tell if the disc was “real” or a sem- blance of an object. It didn’t occupy a specific space, but still came across
