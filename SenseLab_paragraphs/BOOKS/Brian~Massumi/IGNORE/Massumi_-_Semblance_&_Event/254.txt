the sense of human emotions that a dance can give is governed by fam- iliarity with the language, and the elements that act with the language; here those would be music, costume,
together with the space in which the dance happens.
joy, love, fear, anger, humor, all can be “made clear” by images familiar to the eyes.	and all are grand or meager depending on the eye of the beholder.
what to some is splendid entertainment, to others merely tedium and ﬁdgets; what to some seems barren, to others
is the very essence of the heroic. and the art is not the better or the worse.
