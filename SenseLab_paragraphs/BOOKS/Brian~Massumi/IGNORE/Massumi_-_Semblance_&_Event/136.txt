is no special kind of perception called depth perception” (Gibson 1986,
148) because space itself “has nothing to do with perception” in the act of edging in (Gibson 1986, 3)—as we measure where the new sofa might go. Or when we say that “we perceive not time but processes” of emergence (Gibson 1986, 12)—impatiently checking our watch.
When we say these things, we are saying that form, figure/ground, Euclidean space, and linear time are not foundations or containers of per- ception. Experience cannot be derived from them; it is they that emerge with experience. Experience cannot be contained by them; they are among its contents. They are derivations of a more open process: superadditions of habit. Creatures of habit, not grounds of perception (which, as we have almost-seen, is actively self-standing).
This does not imply that we can turn completely away from the level of formal stability. We can never, of course, literally see the imperceptible “ground” of potential over which the figure actually hangs. But then we cannot literally see the figure either. We see our fill. Vision is never literal, always figurative, in an outstandingly direct, overfull way. Acknowledging that does not concede potential and the virtual. For if we cannot see the imperceptible, we can sometimes see the flicker of the figure as it emerges from it. We can undersee the proto-figural abyssing the figure. Seeing the figure’s self-standing by underseeing it is as close as we come to glimpsing potential. We almost-see it, edgily side-perceive it, approaching the actual limit of vision.
