* I would like to thank Arjen Mulder for creating the context for this conversation by formulating the opening issues. I would also like to apologize to him for his becoming a fictional character in the course of the subsequent semblance of a con- versation. Any grumpiness that character might have displayed is in no way a reflection on him but only of my own combativeness with myself.
