phases, of the same ontogenetic process. The sense of “relation” and of “real” change significantly depending on which ontogenetic level the focus is on. It follows from this, in light of the first guideline, that:
4. Relations are not only real, they are really perceived, and directly so. Relations not only have their own mode of reality, but each has its own immediate mode of appearance. The final guideline says that the vast majority of what is, in perception, actually isn’t:
5. “Ninety-nine times out of a hundred,” James writes, the terms and rela- tions that appear “are not actually but only virtually there” (1996a, 69, 71–72). They are present beyond the frame, on the “chromatic fringes”
(73) and at the processual vanishing point, or “terminus,” in James’s vocabulary, where each event turns in on its own unfolding toward its tendential end. “Mainly, we live on speculative investments” (88). The empirical world is ninety-nine percent lived speculation, a surfing “on the front edge of a wave-crest” of “tendency” (69). In order to avoid a romanti- cism of connection, James drums it in that guideline number two, take everything as it comes, means that you have to take continuity and dis- continuity as they come. The beach-falls with the wave-cresting. You have to give each its due. By which time this has continued quite long enough.
