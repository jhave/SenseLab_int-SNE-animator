words removes all limits to nonlocal linkage: open-range abstraction. This is what is called “thinking.” When we pause to think, this is what we’re doing: continuing life abstractly. Intensely.
It is paramount to be clear about this: the world is never lost in thought. Neither is the world’s order lost. What is taken up in language is precisely the qualitative-relational orderings of the objective world: the nonlocal linkages and affective attunements that are the perceptually-felt dynamic form of what happens. Language takes them up. As its moves, the quali- tative-relational order of the world moves with it. World-lines permute.
It is always possible, it goes without saying, to go astray in words. Lan- guage infinitely augments our powers to delude ourselves. But what lan- guage does with respect to abstraction can in no way be reduced to delusion. It also enables truth.
