differencings together, cutting across world-lines and the identities con- served along them. This transversal linkage between world-lines composes a universe of migratory nonlocal linkage exhibiting an autonomous order all its own: an order of manners of movement, of qualities of moving experience.2 This qualitative order doubles the objective order of the world’s historic routes, self-detached from it. Unbeholden to it, it is freed of objective constraints. This does not mean that it would be free from all constraint. The qualitative order of experience has at least one major con- straint all its own: its “spontaneity.”
Michotte insists that the felt-perceptions of movement-quality continu- ing behind, across, and through objective encounters, of balls or cars or anything else, are not learned. They arise spontaneously. They normally go “unrecognized,” even if the objects involved are recognized. Or rather, largely because the objects are recognized. The nonsensuous appearance of the movement-quality as such, as a phenomenon sui generis, is back- grounded by the reappearance of the object’s identity. Still, felt perceptions of movement quality are operative in all circumstances. If they weren’t, there would be no continuing-across of movement. The continuity of movement that comes with nonsensuous perception would go unfelt, fragmented into the discrete forms of the plurality of objects in combina- tion. There would be no direct causal perception, no direct perception of relation, no direct experience of change—only indirect logical association (Michotte 1963, 19–20). There would be no experience of events as such. Stern emphasizes that the activation contour, the nonlocal linkage consti- tutive of the event, is a direct causal perception that normally operates “outside of awareness” (Stern 1985, 52). Fundamentally, it is a noncon- scious, operative “trace” (Michotte 1963, 19).
