From there, Irwin decided to take the work off the wall and move it into the room. He started doing environmental designs that created perceptu- ally-felt fusion-effects compositionally taking-in the entire room. One example will suffice to show how this leads back to an ambulatory rein- volvement of artworking in the world.

The lighting is such that when you first enter the room, you don’t notice anything at all. You think you see an empty room. But what you begin to perceptually feel through your vision as you walk around the room is a visceral sensation that something is amiss. The effect takes some time to set in. It nags at you. You think you feel a little disoriented, a tad dizzy perhaps. You feel something niggling, like a stirring on the periphery of vision itching for you to turn your attention to it.

This produced a niggling
