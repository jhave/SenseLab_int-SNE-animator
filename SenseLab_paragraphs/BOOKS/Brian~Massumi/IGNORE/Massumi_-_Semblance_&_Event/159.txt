This kind of effect is not limited to special controlled conditions. When- ever movement is perceived, we are presented with a “double existence”: a physical registering of sensory input and a perceptual feeling of continuing movement (Michotte 1963, 222).
Think of a case as ordinary as one billiard ball hitting another and launching it forward. The sensory input impinging on the retina registers two forms, each with its own trajectory. One moves toward the other and stops. The other then starts and moves away. That is what we see. But what we feel perceptually is the movement of the first ball continuing with the second. We perceptually feel the link between the two visible trajectories, as the movement “detaches” itself from one object and transfers to another
