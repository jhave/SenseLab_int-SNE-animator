There are complementary approaches to composing away that set out to compose with. Composing-with, as the name implies, involves combining techniques of existence and their respective content-readinesses. The com- bined techniques may or may not belong to a conventional “art” genre, and the same goes for the outcome. Composing-with works across modali- ties of experience, affirming their diversity as much in the process of composition as in its issue. Techniques for composing-with—techniques of existence for combining techniques of existence—are traditionally referred to by such terms as mixed-media, multimedia, cross-platform, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary, depending on the period, context, and accent. The installation work of Robert Irwin is an especially instruc- tive example because it comes to composing-with as an outgrowth of an other-sense insurgency  marking the  success of  a radical  project of composing-away.
