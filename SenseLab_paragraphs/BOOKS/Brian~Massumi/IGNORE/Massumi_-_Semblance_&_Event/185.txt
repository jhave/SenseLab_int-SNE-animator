James defines “truth” as a linguistic procedure consisting in skipping inter- mediaries in such a way that they can be reconstituted in actual movement, given the conditions. This is what he means by “termination” (see chapter 1 on the terminus and the virtual in James).

Language is the potential for an abstractly initiated movement to terminate in an anticipated sense-perception, no less than it is the potential to go astray in the world by dint of detachment from sense-perception.
What James calls the “meaning of truth”—the true meaning of words— is the pragmatic potential to begin a movement nonsensuously and termi- nate it in a sense-perception satisfying an anticipation. This is likely what Benjamin had in mind in the opening quotes of this chapter when he said that what is meant is the sensible. Taken out of context, Benjamin’s statement might be taken to endorse the reductive view of language accord- ing to which its operation essentially boils down to a one-to-one corre- spondence  between  words  and  things.  James’s  observation  that  the
