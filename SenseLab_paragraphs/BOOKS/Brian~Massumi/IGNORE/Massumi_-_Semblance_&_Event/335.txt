causality is best described as a theory of “quasi-causality” (a hybrid between efficient and sufficient causation, objective and final causes; Massumi 2002, 225–228).

21. In What Is Philosophy?, Deleuze and Guattari (1994) ask the “what else?” ques- tion of philosophy. They theorize what is singularly generic about the activity of philosophy, precisely in order to resituate it within a creative ecology of synchretic relation with its “non-philosophical” outside. It is misreading the book to see it as an argument for the “particularity” of philosophy: what makes it philosophy as opposed to art, or logic, or science. The aim of the book is the opposite: to return philosophy to an ecology of the what-else. To make a creative event of philosophy as one technique of existence composing-with any number of others. A Thousand Plateaus is the most intense example of this philosophical composing-with in their combined works (Deleuze and Guattari 1987).
