Art, we all know, is quite capable of making statements too, and often does. One traditional way it does this is by affixing programmatic language to itself in the form of an “artist’s statement” accompanying the artwork and extra to its event. Another is the manifesto. There is also the gesture of including political messages within the work. Taking the speculative- pragmatic criterion of politicality at the letter, these techniques would not be accounted as particularly political. In relation to the speculative- pragmatic criterion of aesthetic force (the fusion-effect constituting a sem- blance), they would not come off a particularly artistic either. They may well be ways of not grappling with the eternal return of content, the litmus test of politicality for this approach.
