5. This reference to nonactualized potentialities complicates arguments that inter- pret Whitehead’s philosophy as an actualism in stark opposition to Deleuze’s virtual- ism. These general categories—like all general categories—are far too gross. They fail to capture  the complexity  of  these thinkers,  or their  kinships  and divergences. Whitehead’s reference to nonactualized potentialities is related to his concept of negative prehension. Negative prehension is the selecting-out of potentials that will not be positively taken into an occasion of experience’s unfolding. Whitehead remarks that the exclusion of a potential, while not positively figuring in the experi- ence’s composition, has a “definite” impact on its subjective form. The potentials are outed-into the dynamic unity of the forming experience. They are actively abstracted out, but not without leaving a dent. This gives them a certain status in the occasion’s actuality, qualifying them as being “in act” in definite trace form. They still qualify as fully real, because Whitehead’s definition of reality states that everything that is real is positively exemplified somewhere, if not here and now. This raises the question of the status of these excluded realities when they are else- where and elsewhen. The category of pure potential is needed to account for this.
