when we forget that there is always, essentially, a speculative aspect to language. We are delusional when we forget the double existence of the world: the immediate abstraction ingredient to every experience, the skip- ping of intermediaries that is always eventfully afoot in one way or another listing our movements to one side or the other of the world’s double order- ing, or terminally attuning them to each other.
To be delusional is to forget that language and thought, as they virtually go together, are creative.6 Relieved of the immediate imperative to termi- nate in the world sensuously, free to range as openly as words are wont to do, the thought-movements initiated by speculation in its imaginative usage are enabled to invent world-lines previously unheard-of and never before seen. These invented world-lines might, as part of some later adven- ture, turn out to be terminatable in sense-perception, proving themselves pragmatically true after all. In the meantime, they remain as virtual as the nascent actions they string together in thought, as free as a word.7
This signals a second-degree “meaning of truth”: the pragmatic poten- tial to invent ways of terminating movements that were initiated nonsen- suously in action-paths yet to be seen, world-lines unheard-of. This is the constructive meaning of truth: the paths leading to a sensuous termination of the movement begun in thought and language must be brought about. They must be made. Their making means that the constructive truth is no less pragmatic than truth in the first, ambulatory, sense. It is speculatively pragmatic with the emphasis squarely on the speculative: intrepidly future- facing, far-rangingly foretracing.
