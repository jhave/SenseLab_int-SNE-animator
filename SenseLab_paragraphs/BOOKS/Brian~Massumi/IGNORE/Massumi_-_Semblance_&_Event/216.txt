reality than the suggestion of ritual. It is not in all cultures at all times that the relational conditions are propitious. Valéry’s account of figural drawing, published in the 1930s about art from the previous century, was already retrospective. Under the combined pressures of the rise of mechanical reproduction famously analyzed by Benjamin (2003) and abstract art’s complete rupture with representation, the sociocultural conditions had already passed beyond a threshold.
The gestural kinship between figural art and ritual fell into abeyance. Which is to say: into potential. Which is to say: potentially drawn back out, intensely, reinventively, to surface again. Antonin Artaud’s drawing of magical “spells” in his works on paper of the late 1940s does just that, making an effective neoarchaism of figural art.
