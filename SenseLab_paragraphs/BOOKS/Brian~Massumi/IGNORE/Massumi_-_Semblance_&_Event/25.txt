It is difficult to express the extent to which a thinking and writing process echoes with other voices, in concord, counterpoint, and at times happy cacophony. It would be impossible to express my gratitude and indebted- ness to all who have contributed, in their many welcome manners, to this project’s taking shape. I wouldn’t know where to begin.
