There is a move from modern dance to contemporary dance that parallels the change from figural drawing to abstract art. The transition is classically seen in the difference between Martha Graham and Merce Cunningham. Graham’s modern dance made symbolic use of gesture. The movements of the body were deployed to evoke depths of personal feeling striking a universal chord. Dance, she wrote, “is the evocation of man’s inner nature
. . . the history and psyche of race brought into focus. . . . The reality of dance is its truth to our inner life. Therein lies its power to move and com- municate experience.” The role of dance is to evocatively communicate an extra-dance truth, construed as the universal truth of “man.” Its “reality
. . . can be brought into focus—that is, into the realm of human values—by simple, direct, objective means” (Graham 1998, 50, 53). Simple, direct, objective means: operating metaphorically.
Cunningham disables metaphor and cuts communication. He strips dance of “all representative and emotional elements that might drive movement . . . to focus on pure movement” (Gil 2002, 121). The focus on pure movement brings dance integrally back to the “kinesthetic sense,” as taken up in vision: specifically at the vanishing point where proprioception enters into a zone of indistinction with thought. Dance kinesthetically “appeals through the eye to the mind” (Cunningham 1968, 90).
