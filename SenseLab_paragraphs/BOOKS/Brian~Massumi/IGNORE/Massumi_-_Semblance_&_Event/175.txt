reappearances will solidify, across their variations, into two identities. Objective organization comes, and with it the child’s sense of its own independence as a separate, locally self-moving object vis-à-vis another: an embodied self. The child separates into its own form-of-life, and its life no sooner takes on objective weight, appearing even to itself as one object- form among others. The spontaneous constraint of shared differentiation in nonlocal linkage is slowly overcome. The stronger this objective orga- nization of the world becomes, the more deeply will the cross-embodied vitality affect that made it possible recede into the state of a trace. Its operations will continue unaware, with, behind, across, and through the world of objective forms populating life-paths.
Transindividual affective attunements will continue to resonate at every encounter along the way, with new attunements forming at every age. The nonsensuous perceptions with which they come will accompany all social learning and all knowing. But they will remain largely nonconscious.5
