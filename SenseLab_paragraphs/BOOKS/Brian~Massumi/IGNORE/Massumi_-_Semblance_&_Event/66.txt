V2_Institute for the Unstable Media* What is central to interactive art is not so much the aesthetic form in which a work presents itself to an audience—as in more traditional arts like painting, sculpture, and video installation art—but the behavior the work triggers in the viewer. The viewer then becomes a participant in the work, which behaves in response to the participant’s actions. Interactive art needs behavior on both sides of the classical dichotomy of object and viewer. Paintings or installations also trigger certain behaviors—from contemplation to excitement—but they themselves do not change as a result of the behavior they inspire in their audiences. It’s one-way traffic; there’s no exchange. This raises several ques- tions. First, since an interactive work aims to evoke a behavior in the audience, can it really do without a form that is “interesting” and therefore in some way aesthetic? Is putting a sign up saying “You may touch the work” or “You may interact with the work” enough? When is the interac- tion “interesting” enough to keep the audience interacting? Can or should this interaction generate the sort of aesthetic experience that we associate with the phenomenon of art? Or is interactive art about a different kind or type of experiences compared to more traditional art forms?
Brian Massumi I’m glad you’re raising these questions. I think that there is a real need right now to revisit the aesthetic in relation to interactive art. It’s clear that saying “You may interact with the work” is not enough. More and more things in our lives are saying that, and we don’t call them
