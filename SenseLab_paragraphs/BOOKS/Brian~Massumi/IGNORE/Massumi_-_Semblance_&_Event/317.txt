The virtual fulfills the same function in Deleuze’s philosophy. Pure potentialities, or virtualities, even when they are elsewhere and elsewhen, exert an abstract pressure on the actual. They are always-everywhere knocking on the door of actuality for admission, and must be actively selected out if they are not to make ingress. In Whiteheadian terms, we are talking about “eternal objects.” The corresponding term in Deleuze is singularities, as defined in Logic of Sense (1990). The key passage in Whitehead on the topic of negative prehension: “An actual entity has a perfectly determinate bond with each item in the universe. This determinate bond is its prehension of that item. A negative prehension is the definite exclusion of that item from positive contribution to the subject’s own real internal constitution. This doctrine involves the position that a negative prehension expresses a bond. . . . Those eternal objects which are not felt are not therefore negligible. For each negative prehension has its own subjective form, however trivial and faint. It adds to the emotional complex, though not to the objective data. The emotional complex is the subjective form of the final ‘satisfaction’” (Whitehead 1978, 41; emphasis added). A negative prehension has the paradoxical status of an unfelt factor in feeling.
