as space-filling in some uncanny way. This resulted from a tension between tensions. The tension between intersecting degrees of illumination (light and shadow), and the tension between the actual relief of a 3D object and the flat background surface of the wall it stood out from, became enveloped in an overall tension. The tension between tensions had the effect of rein- volving vision’s self-possession in a semblance of space. The net effect was a semblance of space wrapped into a semblance of seeing, in perceptual- eventful mutual inclusion. Semblance of seeing making room in itself, for buds of space to make their growth perceptually-felt. All of this was achieved through a composing-with: a compositional technique operating avowedly between elements belonging to different “media,” and even reinviting 3D objects back into the fold.
