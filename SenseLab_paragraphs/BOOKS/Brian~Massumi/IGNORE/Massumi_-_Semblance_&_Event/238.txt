Just as dance comes most intensely into its own by breaking up (breaking open) movement to become a pure expression of bodily power, music can break up sound, to become a pure rhythmic expression. The only way in which music can be said to be like dance is in the sense that it can effect, in its own relational field and in its own manner, the “same” process of emptying  itself  of  symbolic  meaning  and  metaphorical  associations. Music “untouched by extramusical elements”—or to be more exact, music that fusionally mutually includes in and as its own pure event of expres- sion all factors entering its relational field, so that upon entering that field they become musical forces—is termed “absolute music” (Ashby 2010, 6). Absolute music continually, varyingly, repeatingly dissipates sound and reenergizes it into a perpetual state of nascency, as contemporary dance does for bodily gesture. The significant difference is that music does not have to use the body as local sign. Its local signs are incorporeal: sound waves. Pure energy forms, directly perceptually-felt as rhythm in an amodal in-between of hearing and proprioception on a border zone with thought. The thinking-feeling of dynamic sound-form effects an experience of vitality affect in lift-off from the body. The kinesthetic effect seems to float in a space of tireless movement where felt-energies of nonlocal linkage fold into and out of each other, merging and diverging in an endless play of variation. The bodies of the musicians playing the music occupy an adja- cent space from which this universe of music departs, in experiential offset. Except, once again, this is not a space—all the less so for having set itself off in this way from the local sign of the body. All the more Timely. All  the  more  impersonal.  Not  even  “someone.”  No-one  time.  Not  a
