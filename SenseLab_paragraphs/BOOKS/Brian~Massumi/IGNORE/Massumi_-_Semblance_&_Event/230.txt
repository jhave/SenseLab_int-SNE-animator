The dance as such is composed of nonlocal linkages: directly perceptu- ally felt vitality affects. The danced vitality affects are singular. It is of the nature of performance that the “felt energies” of each performance are qualitatively different. The felt force of the performance varies night to night. The vitality affects’ singularity, however, is enveloped in a generic performance envelope. Danced vitality affects are singularly enveloped in a generic affective tonality: that of dance itself as a domain of creative activity, or technique of existence. There is a generic thinking-feeling of dance’s emptying of bodily movement that is incomparable, for example, to the thinking-feeling of figural drawing’s de-limitation of personality. If there is any similarity between the two domains of activity, it is a nonsen- suous similarity, thought-felt in the way a play of nonlocal linkages brings differencings together across varied repetitions.
