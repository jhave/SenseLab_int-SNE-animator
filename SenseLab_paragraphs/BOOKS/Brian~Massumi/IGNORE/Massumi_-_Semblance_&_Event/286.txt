Mahler works with sound. That goes without saying. The real question is, what else?20 What else enters into hearing through his work?

Irwin spent decades painting, purely painting, painting and nothing but. Yes, but … what else?21 We are beginning to get a grasp on the techniques of existence he was investigating when the pigment bled into the streets and the process that had been purely painting went for a walk.

It must grapple with understanding the “which” of the dif- ferences occurring through the phases of the process as it transformationally unfolds. The issue is the hows and whiches of creative change.
