“There must be a continuity of changeable qualities. Of the continuity of intrinsic qualities of feeling we can now form but a feeble conception. The development of the human mind has practically extinguished all feelings, except a few sporadic kinds, sound, colors, smells, warmths, etc., which now appear to be disconnected and disparate. In the case of colors, there is a tridimensional spread of feelings [hue, saturation, brightness]. Origi- nally, all feelings may have been connected in the same way, and the presumption is that the number of dimensions was endless. For develop- ment essentially involves a limitation of possibilities. But given a number of dimensions of feeling, all possible varieties are obtainable by varying the intensities of the different elements. Accordingly, time logically sup- poses a continuous range of intensity in feeling. It follows, then, from the definition of continuity, that when any particular kind of feeling is present, an infinitesimal continuation of all feelings differing infinitesimally from that is present” (Peirce 1992a, 323–324).
The enveloping of color and illumination in one another extends through the senses, each one bearing and indicating all. Mutually enfold- ing. A many-dimensioned virtual whole of feeling is enfolded in every actual appearance in any given sense mode. Synesthesia. A color, smell, or touch is an emergent limitation of the synesthetic fold: its differentiation. A color, smell, or touch extinguishes the whole in its difference. And in the same stroke presents it: as the totality of its own potential variations. All the befores and afters it might be, instantaneously. The distinctness of
