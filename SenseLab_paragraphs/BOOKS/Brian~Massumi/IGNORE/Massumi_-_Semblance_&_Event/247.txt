appearance of a novelty. Every event a creative event. This is speculative- pragmatic fact, ever redefining itself, in process. Fact is definiteness. Novelty is inexplicable in terms of already-defined, objective or sensuous, forms. The definiteness of fact is due to a creative movement continuing behind, across, and through objective encounters.
The definiteness of fact is due to its forms; but the individual fact is a creature, and creativity is the ultimate behind all forms, inexplicable by forms. . . . The novel entity is at once the togetherness of the “many” which it finds, and also it is one among the disjunctive “many” which it leaves; it is a novel entity, disjunctively among the many entities which it synthesizes. . . . Thus the “production of novel togetherness” is the ultimate notion embodied in the term “concrescence.” . . . “Creativity” is the universal of universals. . . . The “creative advance” is the applica- tion of this ultimate principle to each novel situation it originates. (Whitehead 1978, 20–21)
The term concrescence, however, falls short. Of itself, it “fails to suggest the creative novelty involved” in the world’s movements (Whitehead 1967a, 236). It is for this reason that it is useful to have another word, such as synchresis, at the ready to specifically capture the aspect of the oneness of the togetherness creatively leaving the many: the synthetic, or fusional, pulse of process’s bipolar coincidence with itself. Remembering that the “term ‘one’ does not stand for ‘the integral number one’” but for the thinking-feeling “singularity” of an occasion occurring to itself (White- head 1978, 21; on fusion, Whitehead 1978, 233; 1967a, 211–214).
