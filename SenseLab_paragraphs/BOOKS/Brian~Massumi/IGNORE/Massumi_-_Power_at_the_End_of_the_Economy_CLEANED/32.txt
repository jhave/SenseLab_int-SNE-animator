As actions are taken, the resulting affective state of the individual oscillates between them. Foucault notes that the "horizon" of the neoliberal field of life is one of increasing differentiation that is constitutively open to "oscillatory processes" (2008, 259).6 By differentiation, he is referring to capitalist society's overspilling of disciplinary modes of power based on normative models imposed on the individual, and the accompanying proliferation of "minority practices" (259). When he mentions oscillatory processes he is talking about the fluctuation of economic indicators such as salaries, job creation figures, industrial orders, and most fundamentally prices, which mark the ups and downs of the system's self-regulatory mechanisms. But the same description applies equally well to the smallest unit of the economy, the enterprising individual, as it does to the system as a whole. On the individual level, trust and distruct interlock and intensify each other, resonating together in immediate proximity, forming their own oscillatory system. As do fear and hope, satisfaction and self-denial, all in it together.
