It was asserted earlier that a politics of affect would be a political art. Whitehead defines the achievement of intensity as definitive of the AESTHETIC DIMENSION of existence (Whitehead 1978, 109, 197, 213, 244, 279-280). Art would then be the practice OF PACKING AN EXPERIENCE WITH CONTRASTS, AND HOLDING THEM IN SUSPENSE IN A COMPOSITION OF SIGNS: contriving for the affective wave-packet not to collapse, for an intensive interval. This is achieved through the way in which the event of perception is conditioned: which presuppositions are implanted and how; which tendencies are activated, in what rhythm, and in what abductive tension; and what new passions and emergent tendencies potentially arise from that tension. It is in this sense that an artwork is creative: in the manner in which it potentially invents new passions and tendencies. It is not the artist who is creative. CREATIVITY is not a subjective state. It is a manner of activity, passing through the life of the artist. It always expresses as an inventive event.
