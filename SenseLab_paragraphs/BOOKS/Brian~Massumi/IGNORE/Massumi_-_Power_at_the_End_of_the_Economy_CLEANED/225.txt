The second task that Hume allows reason is corrective: to evaluate the efficacity of a means a tendency has decided upon to further itself along its chosen orientation, toward its desired terminus. This task allows reason to indulge in another of its loves: the passion for causality. "Rationality" traditionally favors explanation through the identification of local, antecedent causes, whose linear effects are proportional to the transmitted impetus. This is perfectly adequate to relatively closed, simple systems, on certain levels of reality (those answering to the classical laws of thermodynamics). Under conditions of complexity, many forms of rationality have upped their game to include structural or formal causes. This gives up on the locality of an isolatable cause, but retains a certain linearity of effect: for example, transitions between ages, epochs, or paradigms. Still further down the road toward complexity, systems theory and complexity theory itself have had to rationally recognize the reality of recursive causality: feedback. Once feedback is allowed, there is a boomerang effect that crushes any illusions that might have remained that linear cause-effect relations are generally salvageable: feedfoward.
