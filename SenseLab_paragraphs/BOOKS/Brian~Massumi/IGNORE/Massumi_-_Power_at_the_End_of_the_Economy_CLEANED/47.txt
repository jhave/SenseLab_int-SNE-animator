Given the cross-sensitivity between scales, at the limit the economic system and the subject of interest are themselves in a functional state of indistinction. The whole system is always going down the rabbit-hole. It is just as continually reemerging, through multiplier effects, channeled through affectively-inflected individual actions, back onto its own level. It does not make the trip to its own regressive endpoint and back unchanged. It becomes en route. It addition to the economic SYSTEM—the precarious emergent orderings of the economy as more or less regulated by macroeconomic market mechanisms, and as more or less analyzable using quantitative indicators—there is the chaotic PROCESS of this back-and-forth between levels from which economic determinations periodically emerge.10 The process as a whole is neither governable nor quantifiable. It is AFFECTIVE-RELATIONAL. Given the paradoxical bond between the affectivity of the relational process and the troubled rationality of its emergent orderings, the system that is the sum of the orderings is at best metastable: precariously stable, tottering between bouts of system equilibrium-loss and processual vertigo.
