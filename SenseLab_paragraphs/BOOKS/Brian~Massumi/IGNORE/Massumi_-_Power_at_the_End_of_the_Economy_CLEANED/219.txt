The events need not be dramatic. And they need not wait for an exceptional conjuncture of catalytic conditions. Ordinary events can release potential, in their own intensely modest way. They can seriate, in the tensional gaps of the texture of the everyday. Micropolitical events ostensibly occurring on a small-scale always have the potential to ignite, and amplify. It happens when least expected. In any case, militating for revolution also only ever works when it is least expected—on the back of a self-deciding event-contagion whose trigger-conditions are by nature beyond militantism's consciousness-raising ken. And when it does succeed on its own steam, it is because it is capable of causal forcing—and thus already carries the germs of its own betrayal in its programmatically calculating macro-political genes.
