Joy, understood in this sense, does not map onto pleasure. It can carry a mix of pleasure and pain, or any number of contrastive EMOTIONS. It doesn't map onto any particular emotion either, or onto any particular contrastive emotional pairing. It is the liveliness factor of all hedonic and emotional categories. It is not an emotion: it is VITALITY AFFECT (Stern 1985, 53-61; Massumi 2011, 43-44, 111, 152-153; Massumi 2014). There is an infinite variety of vitality affects. Every event of perception has its own vitality affect, with its own qualitative tenor and tendential force—its own degree of intensity. In this sense, every experience is its own joy. An emotion is a subjective state. A joy is a dividual-transindividual expression of life's potential inventiveness.
Whitehead goes so far as to say that the increase in intensity is the ULTIMATE AIM OF LIFE—even of the "universe" (Whitehead 1967, 201; Whitehead 1978, 107).
