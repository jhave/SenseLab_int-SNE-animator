Hume's concept of passion encapsulates this occurrent coming-together. He defines PASSION as the "double relation of ideas to impressions" (Hume 1984, 2.1.5, 338). A passion is when an affecting impression, and its "instantaneous" reflection in a simultaneously arising idea of the affection, fuse as two aspects of the same perceptual immediacy of experience. The event is then a DOUBLE RELATION BETWEEN THINKING AND FEELING, in the sense that a two-way circuit is established between them. In virtue of this, a passion can give rise to a sympathy, just as sympathy generates a passion (3.3.1., 627). In the back-and-forth, acquired tendencies may be created that work to mutual benefit (the "artificial virtues" of social convention; 3.3.1, 628). But already in the immediacy of the event, the thinking-feeling fusion launches a tendency: a self-driving of oriented activity. TENDENCY is part of the very definition of passion. With a passion, comes a vivacious "FACILITY FOR TRANSITION": activity more easily circulates among the modes of activity that come together in perception, and because of that can more readily transition into an acting out.30 PASSION IS ALREADY AN INCIPIENCE OF ACTION IN READINESS POTENTIAL. This means that perception is not only a thinking-feeling: it is an already-almost-doing thinking-feeling. It is a germinal fusion of action and perception: an INCIPIENT ACTION-PERCEPTION. More radically, not only social conventions but whole NEW PASSIONS may emerge from the "double impulse" provided by the emergence of the first-order passion (2.1.4, 336). Passion upon passion, in inventive proliferation, growing in a communicative contagion of actionable affectability. Hume's favorite word for what the force of passion does is "ACTUATE" (for example, 2.2.2, 393). Actuate: activate. The theory of perception, in its relation to understanding, is an activist philosophy. It would not be stretching it to equate the superpositional process of undergoing just described with "BARE ACTIVITY" coming to determinate expression. The bare activity that is the germ of experience's taking form is INSEPARABLE FROM SYMPATHY. Bare activity can be summed up as the TENDENCY FOR TENDENCIES to form and settle into the world, AS A FUNCTION OF SYMPATHY.
