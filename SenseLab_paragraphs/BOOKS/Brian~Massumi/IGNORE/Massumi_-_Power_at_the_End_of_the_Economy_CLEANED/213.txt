The tendencies immanent to the capitalist field that Deleuze and Guattari argue hold the germs of revolutionary potential are not capitalist tendencies. They may become so, through recapture, as has sadly been the case for many of the tendencies of the '60s. But in their own stirrings, in their bare-active budding, they are TENDENTIALLY ANTICAPITALIST IN the most fundamental of ways: in that they affirm the production of qualitative surplus-value of life for itself, as a value in itself (or more precisely, of the event). In a word, they are micropolitical in the sense just defined. They tend not toward self-interested satisfaction, but relationally eventful joy. They are not consumptive. Rather, they are open-endedly creative. They do not calculate rationally.
