At this point, rationality has lost all pretense of passing final judgment, alone from on high. It loses its grim enjoyment for imposing "correctness": for normalizing situations through the imposition of general ideas, and disciplining processes by in the name of causality. It has found joy. It has lost its prescriptive vocation, and thrown its lot in with intuition. It has agreed to be in the service of spontaneity.
In the phrase "practice becomes perception," emphasis should be retained on the word "practice." A "corrective" function is not one that imposes a "correctness" on an activity from without. A corrective works immanently to a process to tweak it along from within. The mode of the corrective is not judgment, but trial and error: in other words, the iterative re-staging of event-conditions which progressively explore the reserve of potential in an event, as part of a continuing series of events, affectively interlinked at a distance. Trial-and-error assumes no posture of correctness. It enters the event-contagious stream with tweak-effective technique. Technique is applied to the catalytic conditions of the relational field whose characteristics are repeated and varied across the stream of the punctual events composing a series. A corrective contributes to steering the stream. If you want a metaphor for reason's mode of activity in its becoming-creative, it would be more nautical than juridical. Reason, in co-operation with intuition, is not a judge. It is more like a rudder.
