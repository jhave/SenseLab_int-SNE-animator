This points to an experiential plasticity that belies any notion of an underlying principle of PERSONAL PREFERENCE as having the sovereign power to determine action. What are experienced as satisfying qualities of experience are suprisingly open to situational conditioning. How is a jam-eater to act according to their own self-interest, as signed and sealed by the satisfaction of a preference duly attained, if what constitutes satisfaction is fundamentally plastic? What is the difference between decision and non-decision if we can be as convincing, to ourselves as to others, about being satisfied with an outcome we did not choose? It is not only when the nature of the outcome is in suspense, held in readiness potential, that DECISION AND NONDECISION ARE IN A STATE OF SUPERPOSITION. A determinate decision, already verified once by an experienced satisfaction, can be made retroactively to enter into a state of superposition with non-decision by a later experience.
