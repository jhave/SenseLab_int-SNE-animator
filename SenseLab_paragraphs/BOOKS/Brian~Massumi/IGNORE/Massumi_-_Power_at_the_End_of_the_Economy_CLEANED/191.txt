In any case, what has occurred has issued from the "regressive endpoint" of the human: that "INTERIOR ALTERITY" at our sympathetic endpoint (Lapoujade 2010, 68). It has come of something nonpersonal stirring at the inmost endpoint of the relational field, at the limit of the human capital we all are now—that is, that we all are to the extent that we are human and in the thrall of the paradox of our "natural sentiments." To the extent that a freedom-of-the-event has lived itself out through us, we have lived a counter-power: a participation-against-nature. The tendency in that direction is as much a part of our nature as any other. It is beyond the pale of "our" nature. It is an against-the-grain expression of the inhuman part in us, issuing into action. It is, simply, "NATURE," with no possessive—self-possessing. It is nature defined as THE BARE-ACTIVE RESERVE OF ACTIONABLE POTENTIAL IN THE WORLD (Massumi 2009a), issuing in excessive becomings expressing an autonomy of decision. At bottom, nature is world's tendency to grow feral again. Pat patriotic rhetoric aside, the ordinary hero, seen from the angle of the dividual in its transindividual cross-sensitivity, IS AN EXPRESSION OF THE INHUMAN AND THE NONPERSONAL IN US. If "heroism" is a virtue, it is a NONPERSONAL AND NONHUMAN VIRTUE OF THE RELATIONAL EVENT. However recuperated, it is a sign of the potential for feral becomings, done through me, beyond the human-capital pale, churning out from the inmost end of the relational field of life.
