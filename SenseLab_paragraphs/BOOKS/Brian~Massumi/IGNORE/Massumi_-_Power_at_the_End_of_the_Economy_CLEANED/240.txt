Potential/Virtual – Freedom/Intensity
There’s a population or swarm of potential ways of affecting or being affected that follows along as we move through life. We always have a vague sense that they’re there. That vague sense of potential, we call it our freedom, and defend it fiercely. But no matter how certainly we know that the potential is there, it always seems just out of reach, or maybe around the next bend. Because it isn’t actually there—only virtually. But maybe if we can take little, practical, experimental, strategic measures to expand our emotional register, or limber up our thinking, we can access more of our potential at each step, have more of it actually available. Having more potentials available intensifies our life. We’re less enslaved by our situations. Even if we never have our freedom, we’re always experiencing a degree of freedom: wriggle room. Our degree of freedom at any one time corresponds to how much of our experiential ‘depth’ we can access toward a next step—how intensely we are living and moving. Its horizon varies at each transition, and new degrees of freedom can emerge. It’s all about the openness of situations and how we can live that openness. And you have to remember that the way we live it is always entirely embodied, and that is never entirely personal—it’s never all contained in our emotions and conscious thoughts.
