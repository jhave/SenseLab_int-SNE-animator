There are inklings of this potential for non-self-interested becomings in one of the most abject figures of contemporary capitalist culture: the "ordinary hero." The ordinary hero is thoroughly recuperated into rhetorics priming for resemblance/familiarity/contiguity-based politics. Ordinary heros instill pride in country and community. Anyone might turn out to be one. They might look just like me. There might even be one living next door. We are all bathed in their second-hand glow. Their self-sacrifice elevates us. They achieve immortality. (The proof of it is that the pious celebrations of their martyrdom never end.) We feel our own lives have been given meaning. They will have been worth living thanks to our belonging to their kind. The ordinary kind: just human. Or … is it, the American kind? But what about the "first-responder" kind? Or the neighborhood-of-origin kind? All of the above—in a most satisfying confusion of structural levels.
