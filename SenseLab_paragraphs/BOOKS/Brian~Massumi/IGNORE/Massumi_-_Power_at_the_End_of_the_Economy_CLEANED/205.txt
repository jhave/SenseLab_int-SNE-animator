REVOLUTIONARY REALISM is an active recognition that when affective-events of change die, they lay themselves to rest having accomplished a level of transindividuality. The transdividual contagion, to paraphrase Simondon, endows the event with a VIRTUAL IMMORTALITY. The potential released remains in reserve, as what Whitehead would call a "COMPLEX ETERNAL OBJECT": a pure potential for the mutual inclusion of a diversity of contrasts, minus the requisite conditions for its determined return (Whitehead 1978, 271). After a suspensive interval, the potential is certain to reactuate, perhaps at a far-flung taking-place, at a time-taking of the next event's making. That is: if the conditions are given, again. This transmission of the GIFT of the conditions for change should be abductively built into the movements leading up to the event. A REVOLUTION ONLY ULTIMATELY BETRAYS ITSELF IF IT PROVES LESS WORTHY AFTER ITS DEATH THAN IT WAS NECESSARY AT ITS ONSET.
