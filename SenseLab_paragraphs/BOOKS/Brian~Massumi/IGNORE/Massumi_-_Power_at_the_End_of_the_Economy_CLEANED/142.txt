It is an absurdity, Hume says, to push the questioning further. To do so would tip it into an infinite regress. We'd end up in a black hole from which something monstrous, something more ugly and destabilizing than the merely unreasonable, might pop out. Not just a white rabbit. Beyond unreasonable lies the realm of what does not accord with human affect. Somewhere in the infinite regress that we must avoid there lies the limit of what is AFFECTIVELY UNTHINKABLE: what we as humans think to be unfeelable. Viewed from the lip of the rabbit-hole, this impossible limit of human feeling is abject. But what if we do push past, in spite of that horror we feel as putative subjects of interest, to the "regressive endpoint" of human sentiment? What if we confront the abject question, Why should I prefer my pleasure over pain? So what if I prefer your well-being to mine? If the ultimate ends of human action can never, in any case, be accounted for by reason, then "it is not contrary to reason to chuse my total ruin, to prevent the least uneasiness of an Indian or a person wholly unknown to me" (Hume 1984, 2.3.3, 463).27 And in any case, aren't there even more horrific monstrosities that arise from self-interest? For neither is it "contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger" (ibid.). What prevents an individual from skirting around the human endpoint and spiralling into the beyond of its own self-interest? On the other hand, what prevents human self-interest itself from being taken to abject and monstrous extremes?
