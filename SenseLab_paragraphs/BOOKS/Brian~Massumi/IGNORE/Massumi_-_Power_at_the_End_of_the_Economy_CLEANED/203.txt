When this happens, who has decided? POLITICAL MILITANTS who had long been agitating for regime-change or revolution, following their own ideological platform, are invariably caught flat-footed, and are relegated to playing catch-up. If they are successful, that is exactly what they do with the potential released: catch it, capture it. It is not they who cause the revolution. Revolutions are catalytic, complexly co-conditioned and eventfully self-deciding, in dividual-transindividual osillation. It is the programmatic actions of the militants that invariably betray the revolutionâ€”for the simple reason that, however inclusive their ideology, in the affective commotion of the event, with its overcharge of contrastive tendencies, they ultimately only amount to a constituency. They themselves soon become the vehicles for the production and defense of resemblance/familiarity/contiguity-based solidarities, effectively reestablishing boundaries and patterns of exclusion. Every revolution is betrayed. The detonative potential released runs its course and is captured and recontained, if not by its partisans, then by its opponents, and if not by its opponents, by a newly minted constituency that the event itself has invented. The minting of a new postrevolutionary constituency that betrays the force of the revolution is typically assisted by the hero-worship of the figure of the militant, now safely dead.
