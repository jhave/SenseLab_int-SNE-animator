In the 1990s, the period in which neoliberal market deregulation and do-not-laisser-faire-the-government took on unstoppable momentum, management philosophy became obsessed with chaos theory. The order of the day was to learn how to surf complexity, extracting surplus-value on the fly, in the most fluid of conditions, in the absence of adequate knowledge for fully considered decision and the certainty it brings. This is the period in which capitalist enterprise became an "art" of decisionmaking. The management bookshelves where full of "creativity," "gut feeling," and "zen." The alchemists of old were fabled to transmute the most inconstant of materials into gold. Given the far-from-equilibrium complexity of the globalizing economy, a new capitalist alchemy was needed to transmute uncertainty into profit.
