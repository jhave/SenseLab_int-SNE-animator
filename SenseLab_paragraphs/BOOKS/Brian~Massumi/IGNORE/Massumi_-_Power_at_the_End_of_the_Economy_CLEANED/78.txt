The fabulatory element of perception as it varies over time is a creative factor in life. In its absence, the individual would be an ambulant repetition-compulsion, shackled to a bedrock of past preferences and principles. What would possess me to forego my tried and true satisfactions? The only way for change to occur would be through the imposition of modified behaviors from without, either in the form of brute conformal force, or through the disciplinary inculcation of norms meant to be interiorized in such as way as to foster conformal behavior even in the absence of force. Either way, individual choice is just as fundamentally called into question as it is by choice-jammingâ€”and the conformal foundations are just as effectively laid for a potential authoritarianism or fascism to develop by a hardening of the boundary between the normal and the abnormal into a dividing wall of exclusion.
