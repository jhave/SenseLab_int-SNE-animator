As a passion, the becoming-creative of reason is liable to conversion into emotion, as is the case for all affect. As oriented to the relational future, reason is in processual embrace with the process of sympathy. The emotions into which it is most helpful for its passion to convert, in pursuit of its second affective task, are concern and generosity: care for the relational event. But this should not be allowed to obscure the ontopowerful fact that these emotions are essentially personalized expressions of the potential for the relational event. At bare-active bottom, at the inmost endpoint rearising of life, they are nonpersonal virtues of the event. (Manning and Massumi, 2014).47
Mission: affectively-rationally live the generosity of the event. 
Tend it, and enjoy.
