Belonging
In affect, we are never alone. That’s because affects in Spinoza’s definition are basically ways of  connecting, to others and to other situations, affecting and being affected. They are our angle of participation in processes larger than ourselves. With intensified affect comes a stronger sense of embeddedness in a larger field of life—a heightened sense of belonging, with other people and to other places.
