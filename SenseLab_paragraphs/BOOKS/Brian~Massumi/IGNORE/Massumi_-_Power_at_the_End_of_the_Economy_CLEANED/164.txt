Hume also understands his account of the affective genesis of experience in aesthetic terms. But in keeping with his time, he considered the fundamental category of the aesthetic to be TASTE, not intensity. He understood the object of taste to be BEAUTY (a "gilding or staining of the object"), not the thinking-feeling of powers of existence under increase. In keeping with his doctrine of the nonrelation between affectivity and reason, he does not assimilate taste to judgment. He maintains an affective account of it. But for him that means consigning it, and with it the aesthetic as a whole, to the hedonic binary of pleasure and pain. He does, however, recognize taste as a motive force. Suggestively, he also recognizes it as "a productive faculty" that "raises in a manner a new creation." But the manner of creation it raises is a "sentiment" attached to the attainment of a new pleasure, or a familiar pleasure of rare "gilding." This obviates any politics of the aesthetic, returning his thinking to the realm of moral philosophy, albeit of a thoroughly constructivist slant stripped of any foundational "ought" and excluding any appeal to a priori categories of judgment.
