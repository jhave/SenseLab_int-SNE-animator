A politics of dividualism would operate in the unquantifiable currency of INTENSITY, as opposed to satisfaction. It would draw on the positive creative power of fabulation incumbent in perception, tending not only the tendencies dividually churning at the endpoint of the economy, but also to their situational openness and cross-scale sensitivities. This would be a directly qualitative, relational, and situational politics. It would see no contradiction between conditioning by others or by the collective texture of encounters, and the power of self-modulation each individual infra-carries in the playing-out of its dividual tendencies among themselves. It would define decisional autonomy as the co-operation of the orienting influence of situational conditioning and the spontaneity of tendential self-modulation, practicing at their dynamic intersection a POLITICAL ART OF DECISION. It would seriously experiment with the notion that FREEDOM IS IMPERSONAL: that it is at its highest power when decisions move through me, rather than being legislated by my all-too-cognitive, self-deceivingly "rational" I. It would involve care and sensitivityâ€”care for the event of encounter, sensitivity to dividual-transindividual complexity.
