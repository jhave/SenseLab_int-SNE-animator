Intuition involves perceptual judgments. It is not, however, reducible to them. It is not just a faster ratiocination. For there are other modes of activity co-enveloped with perceptual judgments at the ontogenetic level of bare activity. Multiple tendencies are activated at the same time, and these cannot be separated from the "calculations" of perceptual judgment.
