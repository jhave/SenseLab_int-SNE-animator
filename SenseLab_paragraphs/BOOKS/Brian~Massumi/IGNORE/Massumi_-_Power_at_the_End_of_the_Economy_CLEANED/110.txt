If there is counterpower, there can be a politics of neoliberalism's economization of life, in spite of its field-wide systemic reach and ontopowerful processual mutability. But counterpower cannot be found by returning to the subject of interest, for example in an attempt to rationally convince it to choose resistance in accordance with its "true" interests. Counterpower CANNOT RELY ON A PROGRAMMATIC POLITICS OF COGNITIVE PERSUASION. That strategy actually takes neoliberalism's key doctrine of the subject of interest as rational chooser at its cynical wordâ€”ignoring the accompanying paradoxes that make neoliberalism the formidable, undulatory regime of power it is. An effective counterpower politics must engage neoliberalism where it draws its power: in its paradoxes, infra- to its undulations. Counterpower must operate immanent to contemporary capitalism's paradoxical field, in resonance with the economy's inmost end. This means operating, like neoliberalism, as an ontopower. An IMMANENT COUNTER-ONTOPOWER: what other alternative is there, given the globalization of capitalism's neoliberal regime of power? There is no getting outside it. Immanence is not an option: it is a condition of life, and the seat of becoming. The biggest paradox of all is that countering ontopower with ontopower, immanent to its field of relation, requires practicing INTUITION AS A POLITICAL ART.
