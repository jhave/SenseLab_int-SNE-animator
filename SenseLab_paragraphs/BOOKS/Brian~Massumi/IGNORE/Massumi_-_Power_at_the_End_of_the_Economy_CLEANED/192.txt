It's a bit kitschy to call a self-deciding nonhuman virtue of the relational event "heroism," especially when the same tendency can take any number of minor expressions, so as to pass almost unnoticed. For example, anywhere a gratuitous act of generosity or kindness or feral connection comes about, without the vehicle it moves through even pausing to think about it, a mini-event has sympathetically decided itself, cutting modestly into the flow of everyday life. "Ordinary" events can express a freedom-of-the-event just as much as "ordinary hero" events, but moving through with little or no fanfare. Pat humanistic rhetoric aside, these events are also just as much expressions of the inhuman in us.
