Only systematic event-conditionings PRIMING FOR SELF-INTEREST could disarm this tendency, and they have their work cut out for them if they are to overcome in all cases the possibility of an "unnatural" outcome flowing from the formative role of sympathy in the very genesis of perception. It is no wonder neoliberalism keeps itself so busy touting the virtues of self-interest and implanting the presupposition that its denizens are subjects of rational choice, making all manner of maneuvers aimed at instilling transitions that make self-interested rational choice the dominant tendency. It is also no wonder—given reason's Humean impotence, on top of the necessary blindness of the subject of interest that Foucault sees as freeing the invisible hand of the market—that this tendency of neoliberalism to foster tendencies of self-interested rational chioce leads to the paradoxes of decision described earlier, as exemplified in deliberation-without-attention and choice-blindness. Oddly, given his skepticism toward religion, Hume appeals to the trump card of the "Supreme Will" to save some semblance of a solid foundation for self-interested choice, in what can only be read as an implicit admission that the argument from natural sentiment needs other-worldly reinforcement and is in the end no less convincing than its rivals: on the one hand, the argument that there is a combat of affectivity and reason and that reason wins; and on the other the specter of sympathy taken to unthinkable extremes.33 Invisible hands, it seems, have a finger in many liberal pies, of both economic and philosophic confection. 
What do invisible hands do when their finger gets scratched?
