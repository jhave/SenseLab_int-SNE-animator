Deleuze gives another name to the regime of control: the "ENTERPRISE REGIME" OF POWER (Deleuze 1995, 182).22 An enterprise, he says, "is a soul, a gas," a lightness of being (179). A gas: the entreprise-subject's matter is dissipative, rather than frictional. Enterprise-being dissipates in the playing-out of its own gravity-defying lightness. It remains buoyant because rather than projecting an internal force outward, it borrows the energy of its outside and takes it into its own movement. It buoys itself on the quasi-chaotic air currents of the rapidly changing climate of life. Constantly banking, shifting, turning, churning with the flow, the life of the enterprise-subject continually assumes new shapes. It is dissipatively self-structuring, changing in nature as it goes. Its dynamics are nonclassical, far-from-equilibrium. They have no disciplinarily fixed form or "normal" structure. The enterprise-subject is a protean node of decisional autonomy, on the move in environmental spaces that are themselves moving, autonomous, and self-deciding, in the same way the weather is, and every bit as moody.
