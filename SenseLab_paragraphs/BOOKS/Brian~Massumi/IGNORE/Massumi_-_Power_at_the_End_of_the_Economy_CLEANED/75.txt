Even more troublesome for any notion of an underlying set of core preferences are studies demonstrating that under similar circumstances basic MORAL ATTITUDES have the consistency of jam. A similar experiment was performed in which participants were requested to fill out a questionnaire asking them to take a position on a statement of principle such as "to be moral is to follow the rules and regulations of society, rather than weighing the positive or negative consequences of one's actions" (Hall et al. 2012). They were also asked to rate the strength of their conviction on the issues. After filling out a questionnaire, they were asked to justify their position. Their answers had been surreptitiously reversed. A majority of the respondents did not notice the switch, and went on to produce a justification for the diametrically opposed moral principle to the one to which they had so recently adhered. Even those reporting the strongest of convictions on an issue were susceptible to the reversal.
