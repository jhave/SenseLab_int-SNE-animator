Hume's explanation of why the endpoint is not regressive, and why the choices made there both serve the individual's interests and rebound for the common good, appeals to "natural sentiment." It is simply a characteristic of human nature to prefer pleasure over pain in all circumstances. One of the things that human nature obtains most pleasure from, Hume continues, is the approbation of others: what pleases others pleases us, and we benefit by the affective synergy because conventions of mutual benefit emerge from it ("general rules" of  conduct, "custom," "habit"). The reason that what pleases others pleases us has nothing to do with reason. It is in no way a calculation. Rather than a calculation, it grows from an "affectation." We are directly, affectively touched by the pleasure and pain of others. We literally feel their pleasure and pain through a direct "communication of sentiments" due to our natural faculty of SYMPATHY, "which makes us partake of the satisfaction of every one" (Hume 1984, 2.3.5, 407). "'Tis sympathy which is properly the cause of the affection" that establishes the communication between myself and others (2.3.5, 408). It works like this:  When any affection [of another, causing pain or pleasure] is infused by sympathy, it is at first known only by its effects, and by those external signs in the countenance and conversation, which convey an idea of it. This idea is presently converted into an impression, and acquires such a degree of force and vivacity, as to become the very passion itself, and produce an equal emotion, as any original affection. However instantaneous this change of the idea into an impression may be, it proceeds from certain views and reflections, which will not escape the strict scrutiny of a philosopher, though they may the person himself, who makes them. (Hume 1984, 2.1.11, 367-368).
