At the decisive moment, the self is no more in a state of determinate activity than it is in a cognitive state. It is ABSORBED IN A READINESS POTENTIAL that is intensely overdetermined, holding, Luhmann says, "a whole range of possible differences" in "sub-threshold latency" (Luhmann 1979, 73). The whole range of potentials are in it together, in their difference. They are in a state of MUTUAL INCLUSION, on the verge, poised toward the collapse destined to resolve the overdetermination of the and-both into this-not-that determinate effect, registrable in a calculus of risk and probability: from intensity to statistic. Such is the arc of neoliberal becoming.
The nonconscious "sub-threshold latency," churning with the intensity of a mutually inclusive range of potentials, in co-motional intensity, deserves a name of its own: BARE ACTIVITY.
