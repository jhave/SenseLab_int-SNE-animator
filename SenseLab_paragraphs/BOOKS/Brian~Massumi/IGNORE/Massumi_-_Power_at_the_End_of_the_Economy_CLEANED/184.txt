Of course, the immortality is purely SYMBOLIC, not "virtual" (in a contagion of readiness potential rolling across the transition between events). Furthermore, the satisfaction to be had in the structural confusion of macro-levels energizes a politics that easily settles into a defense of group self-interests perceived to be under attack. The production of the ordinary hero is a working part of the politics of "terror." It has its own powers of affective propagation, revolving around the operative logic of preemption (Massumi 2007). Ordinary heros help implant in the field of relation an AFFECTIVE MEDIA-BORNE POLITICS that mass-converts intensity into emotion, in the politically useful register of fear, in oscillatory opposition to the contrasting emotion. That contrasting emotion is not trust, but the politically as well as economically useful emotion of chest-beating "confidence" (Massumi 2005). Who can forget the first responses of the time's most prominent public figures to the 9/11 attacks: 1) keep shopping, for love of country!41 and, 2) hate those swarthy foreign terrorists and hang on! because we're going on the preemptive attack. Don't lose confidence! This affective politics reinforces warlike tendencies toward neoconservatism, in tight processual embrace with the neoliberal economy (Massumi 2009a).
