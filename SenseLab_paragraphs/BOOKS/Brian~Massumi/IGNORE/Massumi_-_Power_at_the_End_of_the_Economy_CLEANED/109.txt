Intuition's taking-control was a coming pivotally into play of an autonomy of decision: a doing done through me. This is not so simple as a PASSIVITY on the part of the subject of interest. The subject's situatedness becomes one of the deciding factors of what transpires. The double involuntary of the feedback and feedforward between the dividual and the transindividual funnels through the situation, and is conditioned by the pressupositions and tendential orientations it highlights. Deleuze's theory of the control society construes the neoliberal field of life as A REGIME OF POWER IN ITS OWN ECONOMIC RIGHT, which operates through modulation. What the tripping into action of intuition demonstrates is THAT CONTROL'S MODULATION CAN ITSELF BE MODULATED. It would be nonsensical to say that control can be controlled. But it is eminently reasonable, intuitively speaking, to say that its movement of becoming can be inflected. The undulatory process of becoming oscillating the relational field can not only be surfed. The neoliberal denizen isn't limited to passively riding the waves, even if it cannot be the sole proprietor and master of its  action. It can make a splash, and experience the "gaseousness" of its "soul" as its own spray. A situational splash of activity can add to and alter the wave pattern: ripples on the surface of universal deformation. Under the far-from-equilibrium conditions of the field of relation, it is always possible that a small splash might amplify into a significant wave. If the neoliberal field of life is a regime of power, a situational splash deforming its surface in ways that goes against neoliberalism's dominant tendencies is a COUNTERPOWER.
