When we speak of the subject of interest's "self-relation" to bare activity, or the relation of the individual to its infra-individual dimension, "SELF-" has to be understood directionally. It is not a substantive. It connotes return. It is a movement. What moves to the limit of the economic field of life's regressive endpoint has nowhere to go but back out, into becoming. What comes in, becomes out. The plane of immanence of the infra-individual is, at the limit, all enveloping, and all emitting. It is the self-relation, in this double movement, of the field of life to itself. "Self-" is an adverb, not a noun. It qualifies the absorptive in-to-the-immanent-limit and ejective out-into-the-becoming movement of bare activity. It connotes a vector of life eventfully folding back into the autonomous zone of readiness potential out of which its next determinate step will decide to come. Self-relation in this adverbial sense is not reflexive, as in philosophical parlance, nor it is reflective in the psychological sense. Both of these notions recognitivize the event, implying conscious recognition or rational calculationâ€”precisely what Luhmann entrusted not to be the case.
