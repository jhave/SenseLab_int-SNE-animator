Luhmann drives the point home: "in the reduction of complexity," resolving into a metastable state, at the immanent limit, at the heart of the process, "there always lies an unstable, incalculable moment" (74). It is around this unstable, incalculable, hypersensitive moment that everything begins to revolve. THE PRINCIPLE OF DECISION AT WORK "CANNOT LIE IN COGNITIVE CAPACITY" actually involving a calculation that guides action before the fact (79). Ultimately, there is no prospectively knowing economic act. The whole process actually works best, Luhmann maintains, if the consciousness of trust and distrust are lost, so that the reduction of the readiness-potential wave-packet "BECOMES AUTONOMOUS" (71)â€”so that decision becomes autonomous. The affective churning of the system, through which the "rationality" of the system cycles, is best left unbeknownst even to itself.
Nonconsciousness becomes the key economic actor.
