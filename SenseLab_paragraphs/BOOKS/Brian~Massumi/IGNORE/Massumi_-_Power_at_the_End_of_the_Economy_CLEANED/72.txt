On the one hand, this "choice blindness" demonstrates the power of perceptual PRIMING. A future sensation can be made to conform to a past sensation to which it is fundamentally different by force of expectation. "Expectation" may simply consist in a lack of cues that anything has changed, so that a new event is nonconsciously equated with the previous one by entropic momentum. This is what Whitehead calls the "conformation of feeling," whereby the present moment dawns as a continuation of the "subjective form" of the immediate past (1967, 183-184). The experimental subjects were poised for a taste, and tasted what they were poised for. The experience of the taste that isn't what it is, is a case of how the most basic SENSORY EXPERIENCE can be conditioned to yield not so much a sense-impression as a FABULATION.
