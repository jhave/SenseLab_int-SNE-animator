The individual subject of interest forming the fundamental unit of capitalist society is internally differentiated, containing its own population of "minority practices" of contrasting affective tone and tenor, in a zone of indistinction between rational calculation and affectivity. In other words, there is an INFRA-INDIVIDUAL COMPLEXITY quasi-chaotically agitating within the smallest unit. The individual remains the smallest unit despite this infra-level complexity, because what resonates on that level are not separable elements in interaction. They are intensive elements, in intra-action (Barad 2007, 33). They are IMMEDIATELY LINKED VARIATIONS, held in tension, resonating together in immediate proximity. Their oscillatory co-motion expresses itself at the level of the individual, where it is marked by fluctuating indicators, just as the actions of individual economic actors express themselves on the systemic level in fluctuating indicators such as prices. We call the indicators of the intra-action occuring on the infra-individual level moods. "Moods," Gilbert Ryle writes, are like "the weather, temporary conditions which in a certain way collect occurrences, but they are not themselves extra occurrences" ((CONDITIONS, INFRA-EMPIRICAL)) (Ryle 1949, 83). Moods collect infra-occurrences and sum them up in a general orientation giving direction to the next level up, just as price fluctuations collect the micro-economic decisions of individual actors and sum them up in the general orientation of the economy as a whole.
