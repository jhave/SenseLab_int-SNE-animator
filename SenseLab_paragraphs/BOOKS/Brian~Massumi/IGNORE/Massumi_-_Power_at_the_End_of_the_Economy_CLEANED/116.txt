This embodied thinking-feeling in movement is intuition. Far from a mystical state one enters at a whim, it is AN INTENSE INVOLVEMENT IN A HIGHLY CONDITIONED, NON-OPTIONAL EVENT. Intuition does not have an object. It has a fielding. It comes with a field potential that is movingly thought-felt before its elements are consciously registered as the objects of a fully formed perception, and is immanent to what occurs as a function of that field. The immanence of this thinking-feeling can be parsed out, retrospectively, into a different aspects or elements. But each of them can only figure because the others are there for it to figure with. They are MUTUALLY INCLUDED in the energizing of the event, as co-operating factors in its playing-out.
