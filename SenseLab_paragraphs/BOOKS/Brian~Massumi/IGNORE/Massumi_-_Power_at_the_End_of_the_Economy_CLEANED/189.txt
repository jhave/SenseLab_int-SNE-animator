Of course, we all also have in us the contrasting tendency to self-preservation and the self-interested pursuit of happiness, guaranteed for US citizens by the Constitution. But there is ANOTHER CONSTITUTION: THAT OF BARE ACTIVITY. That constitution is not just institutionally powerful. It is ontopowerful. At the "endpoint" of the subject of interest, the two tendencies, to coincide with the freedom of an event and the tendency to assert our personal freedom as subjects of interest duke it out, mutually included in the superpositions of bare activity. When the event-conditions are such that the tendency to self-interest comes out of the churning of bare activity on top, the conventional social settlements clinch back into place, and the action-paths followed pass for the results of a "rational calculation." In affective fact, as we have seen over and over again in this exploration of the paradoxes of self-interest, IT IS STILL THE EVENT THAT HAS DECIDED, through an autonomy of decision, issuing out of the double involuntary of the oscillatory complexity of the field of relation. Selfishness is an achievement of the relational field's neoliberal tendency. When that tendency comes out on top, we live up to the systemically desired vocation as human-capital that has been presuppositionally implanted in the economy, and is continually reprimed. When the contrary tendency comes out on top, we have participated in an alter-economic ontopowerâ€”even if our action is in the next instant recuperated by the neoconservative politics in processual embrace with the capitalist economy. For a brief moment that passed faster than the smallest consciously thinkable interval, we lived a counter-powerful affection.
