A key part of Hume's theory of the moderating, regulatory effect of natural sentiment is the argument by similarity: "we find, that where, beside the general resemblance of our natures, there is any peculiar similarity in our manners, or character, or country, or language, it facilitates the sympathy" (Hume 1984, 2.1.11, 368). Where there is difference, the familiarity bred by "contiguity" creates the conditions for sympathy (2.1.11, 369). According to these arguments, there is a hierarchy of sympathy based on established patterns of belonging, according to general kind (for example, the human solidarity of membership in the same species and class solidarities) or owing to the particularities of frequentation (family, community, nation): RESEMBLANCE/FAMILIARITY/CONTIGUITY-BASED SOLIDARITIES.
