Disciplinary power molded the resistant body into normative shape. Control society does not mold, it modulates. A MODULATION is "like a self-deforming molding that is continually changing from one moment to the next, or like a seive whose mesh varies from point to point" (Deleuze 1995, 178). It is pulsing, liquid. It is waveform, in continuous transformation. Correlatively, the enterprise-suject is "undulatory" (180). The enterprise-regime's control society is populated at every scale by "the coexisting metastable states of a single modulation" process (179). Globally, it is "a universal deformer" (179), not unlike a synthesizer. The small-scale (in)dividuals populating the enterprise regime are  themselves populated by coexisting metastable states, wavily correlated to the larger modulations of the environment, to which, in their surf-a-thonic shape-shifting, they are moodily isomorphic.
