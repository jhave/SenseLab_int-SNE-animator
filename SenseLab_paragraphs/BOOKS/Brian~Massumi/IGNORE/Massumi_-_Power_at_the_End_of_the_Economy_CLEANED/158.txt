The relative flattening out of the bell curve of sympathy, as the extremes of the spectrum gain currency, should not be understood to imply that more people become personally invested in taking pleasure in the pain of others, at the callous extreme, or at the other extreme, in experiencing pain in deference to other's pleasure. It is NOT A QUESTION OF SADISM OR OF MASOCHISM. And it should be clear by now that affectivity has to do not with personal, subjective investments, but rather with autonomies of decision that can be only said to reside in the relational field in its unspecified, oscillatory wholeâ€”or to be more precise, in the movements of dividual-transindividual cross-scale sensitivity traversing the relational field, communicating affections in a way that decidedly cuts the flows at each pass, effecting singular events of perceptual judgment that issue into action. THE PROBLEM IS THE VERY NOTION THAT THE HEDONIC FACTORS OF PAIN AND PLEASURE ULTIMATELY GROUND CHOICE, AND ORIENT SYMPATHY'S PRODUCTION OF PASSION-fueled, self-willing tendency.
