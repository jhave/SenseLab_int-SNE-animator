The idea that counterpowerful tendencies to capitalism stir immanent to its field, should not be confused with the "accelerationist" position often attributed (erroneously) to Deleuze and Guattari. According to the ACCELERATIONIST MODEL, the tendencies of capitalism should be pushed to the utmost extreme, in order to precipitate a crisis to end all crises. The capitalist tendency toward the production of ever greater surplus-value, through ever faster turnover, is precisely what has created the far-from-equilibrium conditions in which it operates. Push this manic tendency further, the thinking goes, and the whole, constitutively unstable, balancing act will come crashing down. The problem is that even crises from which the capitalist process is able to recover occasion endless misery. It is difficult to imagine what degree of joy might possibly rebound from the final crash. Deleuze and Guattari do not subscribe to this analysis, which ignores a distinction that is as crucial to their thought as it is to the present account: the distinction between QUALITATIVE SURPLUS-VALUE OF LIFE and quantitative capitalist surplus-value. It also ignores a second, equally crucial, distinction: between consumptive activity (revolving around hedonic satisfaction) and CREATIVE ACTIVITY (aiming for intensification). The forecast final crash would come from over-production in the name of over-consumption. These are essentially capitalist virtues, and remain so at whatever extreme they are taken to.
