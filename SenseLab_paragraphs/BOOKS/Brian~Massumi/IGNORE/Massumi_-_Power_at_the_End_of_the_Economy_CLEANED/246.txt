Shock – Cut/Flow
Affect is about shock, but doesn’t have to be a drama. It’s really more about micro-shocks, the kind that populate every moment of our lives. For example a change in focus, or a rustle at the periphery of vision that draws the gaze toward it. In every shift of attention, there is an interruption, a momentary cut in the mode of onward deployment of life. The cut can pass unnoticed, striking imperceptibly, like a prime, with only its effects entering conscious awareness as they unroll. This is the onset of the activation that marks a coming transition. This onset of experience is by nature imperceptible.
