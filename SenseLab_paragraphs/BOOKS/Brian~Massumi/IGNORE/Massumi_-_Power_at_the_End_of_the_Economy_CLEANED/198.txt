The CONDITIONING of the event, although a requisite of its occurrence, is not its CAUSE. Events of complexity are not answerable to causal determinism. The complexity of the oscillatory field opens the field for chance emergences. But that is not all. The undecidability that comes of these emergent complexity-effects is compounded by the SPONTANEITY OF INTUITION: abductive thinking-feeling, making the cut, flush with the event.
