This is not an argument against revolution. It is a reminder that affective-events of change have a LIFE CYCLE. They rise, and they subside. They live, on a wave of surplus-value of life that they themselves produce. And they die. It is a reminder that this should be factored in from the very beginning. It is not just the onset of the event that needs to be conditioned, but also its passing. What comes germinally modulates what happens after. Anarchist-oriented movements have always, rightly, reproached Marxist and other vanguardist movements of forgetting this, in their misplaced faith that the exclusions and hierarchies of the old order will simply "wither away" with the capitalist State. The history of the twentieth-century should have taught us by now that if the germinal conditions are not tended counter to this, the exclusions and hierarchies are apt to return in what can be an even more virulent form (as was the case with the "actually existing socialism" of the centralized industrial-State capitalism of the Soviet Union). The anarchist slogan that the mode of revolutionary activity must "prefigure" the society to come is not infantile idealism. It is the affective cry of revolutionary realism.
