In the case of specifically targeted, consciously applied practices of priming, like the experiment surveys just discussed, in order to guarantee statistically significant results, they must be capable of setting off an area of subactivity from the background activity of the constitutively open relational field of neoliberal life. However, there are also SCATTER-TECHNIQUES: techniques for sowing primings to the wind, in the much less guaranteed statistical hope that when they fall it will be upon a ground conducive to a special activity self-organizing itself around their impact crater. The internet and mobile communication devices are the most widely available tools for this. They lend themselves both to deliberation-without-attention and choice-blindness. For deliberation-without-attention can also be induced by priming. The way in which new communicational technologies prime for distributed attention, as users click their way through lengthy sequences of linked choices, sets the conditions for the intuitive decisionmaking that the experiment on consumer choice presented earlier confirmed. Who, while surfing, has not had the sensation of decisions making themselves through them? At the same time, the areas of focus that occasionally stand out in the sea of clicks are prime opportunities of choice-blindness to set in.
