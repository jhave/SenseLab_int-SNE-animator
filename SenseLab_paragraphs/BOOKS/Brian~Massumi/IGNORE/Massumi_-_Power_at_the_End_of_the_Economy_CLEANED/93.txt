A POLITICS OF DIVIDUALISM would affirm complexity, and the oscillatory autonomies of decision that come with it. It would find ways of tending tendencies, in order to navigate the zone of indistinction between choice and non-choice in such a way as to effect modulations of becoming that produce self-justifying surplus-values of life: pulses of life experienced as worth the living by virtue of the event they are, immanent to the event, as a function of its immediate experiential quality, without any tribunal of judgment hanging over them, sovereignly purporting to justify them extrinsically. These immanent event-values are not reducible to individual satisfactions, because they emerge from the oscillation between the dividual and the transindividual. Their emergence turns around the dividual, otherwise primed than by the doctrine of rational choice the paradoxes through which it neoliberally expresses itself.
