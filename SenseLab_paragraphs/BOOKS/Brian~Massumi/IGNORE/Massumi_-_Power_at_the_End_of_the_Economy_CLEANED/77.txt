How can people be so fickle? Have they no principles? How quickly they are duped! Think of the political implications! Isn't that how fascism succeeds, by exploiting just such phenomena? Yes, in part, it certainly is. But it is worth pausing a moment before getting too moralistic about the ease with which this choice-jamming occurs, lest we protest too much. Who among us can profess to be immune from such conditioning under all conditions?
Interpreted in light of the first experiment, the plasticity of moral conviction shown in the second experiment appears as a higher-order recapitulation of a PERCEPTUAL DYNAMIC. The phenomenon of choice-blindness points to a tendency toward fabulation built into in perceptual experience. Or more precisely: built into the the temporality of our perceptual experience. The self-evidence of our present perception does not stand the test of time. Our memory plays tricks on us. It is becoming increasingly accepted that a memory is not reproduced. Rather, it is regenerated. A memory is always an event, never a representation. The event of memory varies according to the conditions under which it is produced. Personal MEMORY is an evolving dynamic system that is predicated not on reproduction, but on recreation. In the vocabulary of cognitive science, memory is by nature "reconstructive." This means that the person we are as a function of our memories is self-recreating. If it weren't, personal growth and change would be impossible.
