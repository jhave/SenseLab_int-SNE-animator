The management, self-improvement, and psychological literature of the 2000s overflows with theories of intuitive action and advice on how to mobilize or modulate the powers of nonconscious decision, now considered for all humanly capital intents and purposes to be more fundamental economically, if not better in all cases, than ratiocination. Much of the literature celebrates nonconscious decision, cheer-leading for gut feeling. These accounts are bolstered by studies showing, for example, that the more calculation and rational deliberation goes into making a consumer choice such as buying a new car, the less likely the choice will be to correspond to an expert cost-to-benefit analysis, and the less satisfying the experience will be perceived to have been "post-choice"—even independently of the issue of cost-effectiveness. Influential studies have found A NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN RATIONAL CALCULATION AND CONSUMER SATISFACTION. Nonconscious choice—intuitive "DELIBERATION-WITHOUT-ATTENTION"—produced "better" choices. This effect was slight for "simple" choices, and pronounced for "complex" ones, which in this context is the same as "costly" choices (Dijkserhuis et al. 2006). In other words, the more there is riding on a choice, the less rational calculation can be counted upon to lead to a satisfactory decision, both economically and affectively speaking. In the life of an individual, this might well lead to a viscerally felt disincentive to choose "wisely" by conventional rational standards. Somewhere along the road, it appears that the "good" consumer went out the car window with the "good" (pre-human capital, civil society) citizen.
