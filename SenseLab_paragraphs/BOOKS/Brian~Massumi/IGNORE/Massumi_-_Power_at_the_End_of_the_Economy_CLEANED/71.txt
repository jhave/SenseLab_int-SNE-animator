There are strange doings in the tea party of choice. Researchers in the psychology of consumer choice asked subjects to make a simple choice: between two varieties of tea and jam (Hall et al. 2010). The tastes of the proposed alternatives were as different as can be, for example between cinnamon-apple and bitter grapefruit. Participants were asked which variety they preferred. The researchers then switched the varieties unbeknownst to the tasters. Then they asked them to take what they thought was a second sample of their preferred flavor, and explain why they liked the flavor best. Two thirds of the time, the experimental subjects did not notice the switch. A cinnamon-apple aficionado would happily ingest bitter grapefruitâ€”and convincingly explain their preference for it. Talk about rationalization of choice.
