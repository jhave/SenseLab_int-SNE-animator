Does that sound like a moral philosophy? If you add to this account the idea of priming and other forms of event-conditioning, and the wholesale modulation of the relational field effected by event-conditioning—including the potential for new, emergent action-paths to be invented—then what you have is much more like a politics: a FUNDAMENTALLY AFFECTIVE POLITICS. In the affective politics implied, rational choice has no foundational role or reality. Fundamentally, it's not about choice—it's about sympathy. And sympathy is in the immediate communication of affections between individuals: it is TRANSINDIVIDUAl.
