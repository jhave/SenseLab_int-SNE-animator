It is of the utmost significance that priming depends, on the one hand on the individual's susceptibility to its own tendential infra-churnings, and on the other, on its OPENNESS TO THE SITUATIONâ€”the individual's bipolar affectability. Priming operationalizes the cross-sensitivity between the INFRA- AND MACRO- POLES of the field of neoliberal life. It attaches its procedures to the relational event-sensitivity of the denizen of the oscillatory neoliberal field of life activity. Priming is the power mechanism most closely allied to the workings of the neoliberal economy, as it lives out the paradoxes of its doctrine of self-interested choice. Its eshewal of hard-edged normative-disciplinary procedures makes it an exemplary mechanism of "soft power." The preemptive mode of power that characterizes the neoliberal field of life, in WAR and POLICING as much as in relation to the market, pivots on priming. Priming is the royal way to the modulation of events before they fully emerge.
