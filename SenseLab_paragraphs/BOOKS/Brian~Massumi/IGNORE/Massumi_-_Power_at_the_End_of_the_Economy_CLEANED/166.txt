This is not to say that there is no possibility of joy arising in capitalism. There are intensities aplenty, and joys may even be found in consumption. The intensities potentially register counter-tendencies, and the joys of consumption are had by making a creative art of it, against the equilibrium-seeking impulse toward entropic satisfaction, instant or deferred. This can be seen, for example, in fan cultures, DIY cultures, hacking cultures, and culture-jamming activities, all of which turn consumption back around into productive activity. In all of these cases, a dividual-transindividual dynamic is affirmed and inflected, even if it is not explicitly thought of in those terms. The "subject" of the practices is collective, and the collective tendency is to invent new tendencies, in viral contagion. The object of consumption is reactivated, and reactuates, as a sign of passion (a sign that strikes in such a way as to give rise to a passion, and potentially to the invention of new passions to follow). Sympathy reasserts its rights as a force of existence. There are stirrings of joy. It is in virtue of this collective reaffirmation of sympathy-based passion as a "productive faculty" and a joy, that arts of consumption register counter-tendencies. This does not constitute a politics per se, but neither is it business as usual.
