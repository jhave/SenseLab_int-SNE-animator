There is only one answer to these questions: there is no general answer to them. The purpose of raising them is not to prefigure a solution, but rather to point to the need for a proliferation of practices aimed at developing TECHNIQUES OF RELATION that answer to this problematic delineated by the unanswerability-in-general of such questions. Although unanswerable in general, the problem is singularly stageable. It is eminently possible to set in place conditions that reactivate the problematic field these questions gesture toward. When that is done, with sufficient art—with sufficient technique leavened with a healthy dose of relational intuition—an affective event may well be occasioned. There is no way around a trial-and-error approach. Each event is the affective germ of a series of events that belong to each other, at a distance and across suspensive intervals. Practices of the political art of the event are experimental practices that want nothing so much as cascading company, commotionally taking-place as they serially make their own time.
