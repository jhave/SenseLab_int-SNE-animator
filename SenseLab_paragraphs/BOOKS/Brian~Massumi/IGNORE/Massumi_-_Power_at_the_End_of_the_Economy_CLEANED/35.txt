The uncertainty is not just external, relating to accidents and the unpredictable actions of others. It agitates within. Even if you play it as safe as possible by deferring a decision until sunnier days to come, all you have done is find another way to increase uncertainty: now it is not just others' decisions that are unknown to you, but your own as well. "These unknown nondecisions recur endlessly" (Pixley 2004, 33). Who knows what will possess you to decide when to decide, or what you will decide when you do? You don't know your future self yet. You are infra-buffeted by your own unworked-out tendencies awaiting a complex playing out that is as likely to surprise you yourself as any stranger. Weather forecasting is as unpredictable in the infra-climate of the (in)dividual as at other scales.
