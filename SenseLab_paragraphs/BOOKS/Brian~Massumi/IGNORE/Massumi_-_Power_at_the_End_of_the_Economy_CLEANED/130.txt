It must be said that little of this applies to economics. The status of economic's rationality as a "science" is widely, and rightly, contested. The true status of the "dismal science" is more a fusion of wishful thinking and market boosterism, than of perceptual judgment and abduction. The tribunal of reason has not been kind to it. The denizen of the neoliberal field is largely left to its own abductive devices.
