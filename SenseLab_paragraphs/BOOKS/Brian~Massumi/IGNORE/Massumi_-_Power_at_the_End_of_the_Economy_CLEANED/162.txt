An affective art of politics would similarly pack experience with contrasts, at the strike of a sign, or a composition of signs. It would also hold the actuated tendencies in suspense, trying not to allow the affective wave-packet to collapse in a way that would determine quanta of satisfaction and success to sort outâ€”at least not right away, or in any way assimilable to a calculus of interests. Once again, interest is not fundamentally ingredient to the event's occurrence. Sympathy is its mode. However, as new passions and tendencies emerge and settle into the world, interests will inevitably grow up around the settlements. Far from interest being primary, it is INTENSITIES OF EXPERIENCE THAT GIVE RISE TO INTERESTS. Interests are the settled creatures of intensity. They are invented by affective means foreign to their own dynamic of avoiding pain and seeking pleasure. Hume, and the neoliberals, got it backwards. Satisfaction does not come at the end, arrived at by following one's own interest. It comes en route, in the SELF-AFFIRMING VALUE OF THE PROCESS ITSELF. It comes in the immediate experience of a qualitative "more" to life, a surplus-value of life that is lived intensely, such that its very living is its own reward. To call this satisfaction is to belittle it, so different it is from hedonic satisfaction, and so much more vital. Spinoza's term is best: JOY. Joy is much more than a pleasure. It registers the invention of new passions, tendencies, and action-paths that expand life's powers, flush with perception. It registers becoming. It is an immediate thinking-feeling of powers of existence, in passionate intensification and tendential increase.
