If relying on personal bonds of trust is out of the question, there only one option: "depersonalize" trust." Make it "impersonal" (Lumann 1979, 93). Entrust the system. "System trust" is the only answer. But how does an individual trust a system that doesn't trust itself to follow its own line? "There must be other ways of building up trust which do not depend on the personal element. But what are they?" (46). Luhmann has an ingenious answer to his own question. You actually "SHIFT FORWARD THE THRESHOLD OF EFFECTIVE DISTRUST" (75). IN OTHER WORDS, YOU FOSTER DISTRUST AS A STARTING CONDITION (88). YOU FOSTER DISTRUST, BUT NOT AS THE OPPOSITE OF TRUST: AS ITS "FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENT" (71). 
What on earth does that mean? It means that you "interlock them so that they intensify each other" (Luhmann 1979, 92). You bring trust and distrust together into a zone of indistinction where they are in such immediate proximity to each other that one can easily tip into the other at the slightest agitation. They resonate together, intensely.
