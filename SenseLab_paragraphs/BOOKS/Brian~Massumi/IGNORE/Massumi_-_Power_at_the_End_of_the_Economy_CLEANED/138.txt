Politically, things are never as simple as a bull in a ring. Capitalism's fences don't keep its bullishness in, or the movements it's most afraid of out: unofficial or unregistered flows of goods and people, unregistrable financial flows, and systemically imperceptible forms of capital. Unofficial and unregistered flows include the smuggling of legal and illegal commodities such as drugs, and the press of refugees and undocumented workers. Unregisterable flows include highly abstract forms of financial capital such as derivatives and credit default swaps whose complexity defies calculation,25 and at times even makes tracing ownership impossible (this has been a problem in the wake of the US subprime mortgage crisis). Systemically imperceptible forms of capital include neo-currencies like Bitcoin. Capitalism is afraid of these movements to the extent that it tends to its own metastability, counter to its dominant tendency of irrationally exuberant passion for reckless liquidity. But at the same time, these movements are its indispensable crutches, and its cutting-edge (its profit hedges, and its probe-heads of futurity). Hence: porosity is the order of the day. Through the pores, distant events resonate, and correlate. To paraphrase Foucault, the neoliberal denizen is complexly dependent on an uncontrollable, unspecified whole of the flow of things and the world in which "the most distant event taking place on the other side of the world may affect my interest, and there is nothing I can do about it" (Foucault 2008, 277).
