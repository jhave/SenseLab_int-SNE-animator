On the plane of immanence, the economic system and the subject of interest are jointly in potential, in a functional state of indistinction at the level at which action is just beginning to stir, in the INCIPIENCE of what is to come. The symmetry between the infra-individual and the economic field as a whole, across their difference in scale, is only apparent. The infra-level is in a very real sense the larger of the two, in that it germinally includes the relation between levels, at the immanent limit. Entangled in the zone of indistinction of readiness potential, the subject and the system come together, to become together. Every little act turning out from the regressive endpoint ollapses the wave packet, destroying the infra-state of functional indistinction. The commotion on the infra-individual level acts out. It is then registered as an indexable occurrence, summing up the individual's irreducible and nontransferable relation to itself in an economically significant act. Through the registering of the action, discernible levels bounce back into place. Scales accordion back out. The system re-self-organizes out of its processual rabbit-holing.
