This prepares the way for the next section's discussion of Hume's theory of the limits of reason, as well as on the roles it can play in its relation to affectivity. The crucial point here is that STRUCTURES OF RATIONALITY LIVE BY WHAT ESCAPES THEM. They feed on affective-relational intuition. What positive power they possess is extracted from perceptual judgment and abduction. RATIONALITIES ARE APPARATUSES OF CAPTURE OF AFFECTIVITY. As we will see, so are emotions. A rationality is not unlike a collective structure of emotion (just vastly more proceduralized). That is why we become so easily invested in them.
