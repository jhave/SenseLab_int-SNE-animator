When the supposed sovereign power of choice is called into the question, the reaction is  often that an indignity has been done to PERSONAL FREEDOMâ€”as if this notion could have survived unscathed the combined onslaughts of psychology, philosophy, and marketing, to name just a few of its historical nemeses. The indignation is based on the assumption that the opposite of rational choice is "IRRATIONALITY," the ultimate enemy of freedom. Irrationality is typically equated with "emotion," making affectivity enemy number two. But as we have seen, THE OPPOSITION BETWEEN THE RATIONAL AND IRRATIONAL IS NO LONGER SUSTAINABLE, if it ever was. Neoliberalism's pivoting around zones of indistinction between rationality and affectivity, its alloying of them as functional equivalents at critical points in its process, requires doing away with the duality. Instead, they must be seen as co-operating modes of activity that separate out under certain circumstances, no sooner to reconverge, feeding back and forward into each other with all the restlessness of bare activity. Only that bipolar oscillatory process as a whole can be seen as determining in the last instance. Except that it's not a last instance. It's a first and last and all-over instance: an irreducibly multiple and relational fielding, at the inmost endpoint of the economy as at its furthest reaches.
