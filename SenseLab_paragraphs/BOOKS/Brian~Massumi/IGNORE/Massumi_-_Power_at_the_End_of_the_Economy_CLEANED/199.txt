As we saw earlier, abduction can lead to the invention of new action-paths. That inventivity is already at the affective core of perception's genesis, which as we saw with Hume involves the production of passions and tendencies, and from these still more of both, in a cascade of decisional cut and ongoing transition. Emergence is one thing. Invention is another. They piggy-back on each other. Together, they are doubly ontopowerful. There is no cut-and-dried distinction between them. There is, however, a difference of degree. INVENTION carries a stronger charge of passional volition. It has a momentum fueled and refueled by pulses of passion carrying the event through transitions across which its qualitative force affectively changes and qualitatively evolves. Invention is the event deciding itself to become. IT IS WHAT THE EVENT WANTS, WHEN IT WILLS ITSELF CHANGE.
