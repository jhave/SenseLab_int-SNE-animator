All of this depends on rationality accepting the humbling fact that it does not have to be opposed to passion, and enter into heroic combat with affectivity. It has to distance itself from its own history. In experiencing the joy of ontopowerful invention, rationality will come to accept the fact that it is itself a passion after all. Just one of a contrary humor historically, overly enamored of its own hybris, and strangely overestimating of its own tendential force. When reason reconciles itself to its own passion, it can finally tend to the relational future of creative co-operation. This entails admitting that its love for generality and causality were always already passionsâ€”albeit of a limitative calling, acting to curtail more inventive and expansive passions, thus figuring as passionate factors of anti-becoming. Reason must admit its own passionate nature, in order to convert itself from its limitative exercse into a force for becoming, in an immanent self-overcoming internal to its own critical/corrective exercise. Now reason is in a position to return the favor affectivity has always done it, in allowing structures of rationality to live off the capture of its positive force for invention without so much as a thanks.
