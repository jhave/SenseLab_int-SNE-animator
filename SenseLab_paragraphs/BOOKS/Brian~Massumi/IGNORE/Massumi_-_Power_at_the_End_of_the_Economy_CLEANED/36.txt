The affective infra-climate of the dividual poised for what may come is the rabbit-hole of the economy. The unknown nondecisions and not-quite-occurrences recurring endlessly in a turbulence of tendency are complex in the same way as the economy as a whole. Both are like the weather, quasi-chaotic self-organizing systems. This puts a whole new perspective on "rational" choice. The individual, Foucault said, is unconditionally referred to itself, and this referral is irreducible and nontransferable. This means that rational decision is unconditionally, irreducibly, nontransferably refered to an infra-individual zone of indistinction with affect. RATIONALITY AND AFFECT BECOME "FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENTS" by Luhmann's definition: interlocked and mutually intensifying, in a zone of indistinction, at the "forward threshold" of economic existence.
