Luhmann's analysis of trust posits that this infra-level of individual complexity is directly connected to the collective, macro-level of the economic, without necessarily passing through the MEDIATION of the intervening micro-economic level at which the individual is but one. It is a defining characteristic of complex environment that THE EXTREMES OF SCALE ARE SENSITIVE TO EACH OTHER, ATTUNED TO EACH OTHER'S MODULATIONS. This is what makes them oscillatory. They can perturb each other. System-wide changes in the weather are sure to resonate at the infra-level, for example in a localized patch of fog. Perturbations channeling back up from the infra-level are apt to amplify into multiplier effects. Think of the way a local fog can amplify into a mega-traffic jam. The individual blindness of the subject of interest is the fog of the economy. When multiplier effects channel upward, the individual is not mediating between the levels in any conventional sense. Self-organizing effects channel through the individual level on their infra-way to larger things. The individual is an amplifier mechanism for multiplier-effects' self-forming. It channels the threshold noise of the system—the functional indistinction between rational calculation and affective response—into an emergent economic ordering that is as ever-changing and continually self-renewing as the winds. In a very real sense, the infra-individual is the crucible of the system.
