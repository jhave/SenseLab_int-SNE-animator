The fact that rational choice works best where it matters least indicates that rationality only effectively separates out under carefully controlled conditions where the ambit of life is reduced. It assumes, and demands, the reduction of vitality, a limiting of life's amplitude. Looked at this way, rationality is a limitative mode of power. REASON IS AN ANTI-ONTOPOWER. The question then arises: given this choice, why choose rational choice? What justifies that? Choosing anti-ontopower over ontopower is clearly not itself a rational choice. It is more a matter of inclination. But then, doesn't that make it a desire? Oops. Enter the zone of indistinction again: rationality is a desiring tendency; as a desiring tendency, it is as much a mode of affectivity as â€¦. affectivity is rational given the intense situation that the life environment as a whole harbors uncertain conditions of complexity. If neoliberalism acted more on its doctrine of self-interested, rational choice than on the paradoxes it generates, it would miss its historic calling as an economic regime of ontopower.
