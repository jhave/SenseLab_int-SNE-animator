The event contagion did not produce a spreading conformation. Quite the contrary, what propagated were DIFFERENCINGs. Each event along the way, in addition to being stoked by the affective strike of the signs of the passion of the other trans-ing itself in at a distance, was also infra-stoked by an event occurring immanently to a more restrained field of relation: INFRA-TRANS CO-CONDITIONING. For each new occurrence in the series, there were what Simondon calls "GERMINAL FORMS." These are affections occurring immanent to a field of relation that already has a certain consistency, including a texture of conventional belongings (for example, along national, religious, and party lines). All fields of relation textured by such resemblance/familiarity/contiguity-based constituencies are riddled with internal structural tensions. The germinal affection is small event that CATAPULTS THE RELATIONAL FIELD INTO A FAR-FROM-EQUILIBRIUM OSCILLATION, exacerbating the tensions and necessitating a resolution that does conform to any of the already arrived-at solutions on offer from a particular constituencies sharing the field. The germinal affection-event catapults the relational field toward a CRITICAL POINT, where it must either fragment into a turf-fight between constituencies, or pass, as an unspecified whole of flow, over a threshold to a new consistency. The passing of the threshold occurs in DIVIDUAL-TRANSINDIVIDUAL FEEDFORWARD AND FEEDBACK. No cause can be isolated. The germinal affection-event is catalytic (given the conditions), not causally determining. The effect it produces cannot be predicted: it must be invented.
