However, since it is the other that emitted the sign that triggers the movement, our engrained associative HABITS OF PERCEPTION are apt to assign THE OTHER AS CAUSE OF THE EVENT. The landscape of potential is then attributed to the other, and the tendency is then to construe it as belonging to the other. The affective communication now no longer appears as an immediate relation bringing about a transition between events: the other's affection and its eventual issuing forth in my actions as a function of sympathy. It is experienced instead as the transmission to me of a content of the other's life. As if the other and me were separate interioritiesâ€”rather than cross-sensitive, trans-correlated (in)dividualities. The landscape of potential is then experienced as the sign of a POSSIBLE WORLD that is subjective in nature.
