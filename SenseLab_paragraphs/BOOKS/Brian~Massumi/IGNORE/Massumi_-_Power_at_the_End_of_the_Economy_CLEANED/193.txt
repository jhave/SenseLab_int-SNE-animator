Freedom-of-the-event comes in all sizes and in various degrees of vivacity, or affective force. The variety is as infinite as that of vitality affect. However small the splash, however fleeting or fading, its vital intensity still surpasses that of the grandest of self-interested gestures.  As well, by the way, as that of even the most celebrated of acts of ALTRUISM performed with the aim, conscious or not, of obtaining the satisfaction of other's approbation, or of achieving symbolic immortality. Such gestures observe the resemblance/familiarity/contiguity-based conventions constitutive of the human settlement. They are, in effect, if not in actual point of fact, "rationally calculated." 
This, notably, excludes charity and the PHILANTHROPIC spirit from the politics of sympathy implied by this analysis. Sorry, Bill Gates: you're within the human pale after all.
