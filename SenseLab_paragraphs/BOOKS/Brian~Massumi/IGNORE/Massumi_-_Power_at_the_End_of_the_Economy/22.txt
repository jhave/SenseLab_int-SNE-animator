This is existence in its dissociative dimension. Here, in its relation to itself, the subject circles itself more and more tightly around its individual power of choice, like a dog to sleep, wrapping itself centripetally around a center of promised satisfaction. It circles in on itself, away from the social, unmindful of noneconomic societal logics. But it all works out to the best for society in the end, they say, thanks to the postive synthesis of multiplier effects. Relation to oneself involuntarily amplifies across the multiplier effects to become a system-wide social fact. The inmost dimensions of individual existence are operatively linked to the most encompassing level, that of the market environment that is the economic field of life. What is most intensely individual is at the same time most wide-rangingly social. THE SMALLEST SCALE AND THE LARGEST SCALE RESONATE AS ONE, IN A QUASI-CHAOS OF MUTUAL SENSITIVITY. TO RELATE SELF-INTERESTEDLY TO ONESELF IS IN THE VERY SAME ACT TO RELATE, INVOLUNTARILY, TO EVERYONE ELSE.
