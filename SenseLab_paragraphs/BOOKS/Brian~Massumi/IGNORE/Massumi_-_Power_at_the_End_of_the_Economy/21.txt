But it's not a hand at all. It's an accumulation of little-handed decisions which end up serving the general good in spite of being self-interested. Individual decisions, made in the darkness of self-interest, percolate through the field. To the extent that the results of these decisions form positive feedback loops, they give rise to mutually beneficial multiplier effects and there occurs a "spontaneous synthesis" of what's best for all (Foucault 2008, 300). The synthesis is entirely involuntary with regard to each individual (275-276). This "rationalization" of the economy to which the subject of interest's decisions involuntarily contributes is an emergent property of a complex, self-organizing system: a novelty and a creation, forever self-renewing. The synthesis, Foucault continues, is a "positive effect" of an "infinite number" of "accidents" occurring ground-level in the "apparent chaos" (277), or quasi-chaos, of the market environment. These are bound together by a "directly multiplying mechanism" — competition — which, Foucault emphasizes, operates in the absence of any form of transcendence (275-276). In other words, the positive synthesis of market conditions occurs immanently to the economic field. The choice of the subject of self-interest rabbit-holed in that field of immanence is "irreducible" and "nontransferable" (272). It is "unconditionally referred to the subject himself" (272). At its core, Foucault says, the liberal economic model is one of "existence itself": it concerns first and foremost a relation of the "individual to himself" (242).
