The Autonomy of Affect - Escape
Affect is autonomous to the degree to which it escapes confinement in the particular body whose vitality, or potential for interaction, it is. Formed, qualified, situated perceptions and cognitions fulfilling functions of actual connection or blockage, are the capture and closure of affect. Emotion is the intensest (most contracted) expression of that capture—and of the fact that something has always and again escaped. Something remains unactualized, inseparable from but unassimilable to any particular emotional expression. That is why all emotion is more or less disorienting, and why it is classically described as being outside of oneself, at the very point at which one is in most intimately and unshareably in contact with oneself and one’s vitality. If there were no escape, no excess or remainder, the universe would be without potential, pure entropy, death. Structures, of all kinds, emotional and otherwise, live in and through that which escapes them. Their autonomy is the autonomy of affect. The autonomy of affect is its participation in the virtual: potential remaindered by the past, left in reserve for the future. Its autonomy is its openness. Its openness is to the escape-hatch of its own futurity.
