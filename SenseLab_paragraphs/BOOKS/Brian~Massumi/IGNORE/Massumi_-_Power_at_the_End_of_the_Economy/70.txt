Qualities of Life 
The feeling of the transition as the body moves from one affect, or power of existence, to another has a certain separability from the event it is bound up with, in that the transition itself is distinct from the capacitation activating the passage. What is felt is the quality of the experience. The account of affect will then have to directly address forms of experience, forms of life, on a qualitative register.
