Redoubling - Emotion
Because affect concerns the movements of the body it can’t be reduced to emotion.  It is not subjective in the sense of belonging to a subject to which the body belongs. Which is not to say that there is nothing subjective about it. Spinoza says that every transition is accompanied by a feeling of the change in capacity. The affect and the feeling of the transition are not two different things. They’re two sides of the same coin, just like affecting and being affected. This is one sense in which affect is about intensity—every affect is a doubling. The experience of a change, an affecting-being affected, is redoubled by an experience of the experience. The two together give each event a unique subjective form. It gives the body’s movements a kind of intensive depth that stays with it across all its transitions, accumulating—in memory, in habit, in reflex, in desire, in tendency. Emotion is the way the intensive depth of that ongoing experience registers personally at a given moment. It is only on the level of emotion that this subjective form of the affective event comes to be experienced as belonging to a subject separate from the event.
