Perception of Perception – Vitality Affect
The escape of affect cannot but be perceived, alongside the perceptions that are its capture. This side-perception may be punctual, localized in an event (such as the sudden realization that happiness and sadness are something besides what they are). When it is punctual, it is usually described in negative terms, typically as a form of shock (the sudden interruption of of functions of actual connection). But it is also continuous, like a background perception that accompanies every event, however quotidian. When the continuity of affective escape is put into words, it tends to take on positive connotations. For it is nothing less than the perception of one’s own vitality, one’s sense of aliveness, of changeability (often signified  as “freedom”). One’s “sense of aliveness” is a continuous, nonconscious self-perception (unconscious self-reflection or lived self-referentiality).  It is the perception of this self-perception, its naming and making conscious, that allows affect to be effectively analyzed.
