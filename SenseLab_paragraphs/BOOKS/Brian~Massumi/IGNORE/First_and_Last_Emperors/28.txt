	The Bush body followed in its voice's footsteps: "Read My Hips" he said, jogging away from reporters ["A Case of Doing Nothing," Time, 7 January 1991, p. 29, reporting on events of October 1990]. His public image became so low-key that it left the impression that he was on full-time paid leave--in Bush's nonwords, he began "vacating" regularly [International Herald Tribune, 31 August-1 September 1991]. His preferred public pose was no longer in suit and tie behind a podium, but in leisure wear with golf club. Bush all but disappeared from the media gaze and microphone, only in order to reappear transformed, reconnected in his own unique way to the body without an image.
