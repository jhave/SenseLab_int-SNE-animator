Apoliticality starts from general statements like “That’s just the way it is” and “Be realistic.” If it moves ahead from there, it is on the shuffling crutches of a tired “ought”—one often reflecting a sense of how things used to be, in the old days when they were really sitting pretty. “That’s the way things were”/“that’s that way things ought to be” . . . so stop fidgeting and be realistic, already. Apoliticality’s arc, in its conservative expression, is from the inertia of the real back to the future. In its revolutionary expression, it is equally concerned with backing the future into conformity with a past: just a recent past of directive decision by a vanguard. In either case, the appetite is for subordinating activity to statement, and statement to program. This way of doing “politics” is at best program proud. It is always process poor—and for that reason, qualifies speculativepragmatically as apolitical (acosmopolitical).
