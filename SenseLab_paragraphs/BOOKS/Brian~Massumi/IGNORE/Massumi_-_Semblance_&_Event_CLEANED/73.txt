The feeling of seeing the abstract line of the event is a vision-effect. It is an effect of the event-triggering tension inherent to the human-mouse differential. It expresses that differential in an abstract perception of the dynamic unity of the event, as you feel you saw it with your eyes, or perhaps eyed it into feeling. In other words, the dynamic form of the event is perceptually felt, not so much “in” vision as with vision or through vision: as a vision-effect. It is a lived abstraction: an effective virtual vision of the shape of the event, including in its arc the unseen dimensions of its immediate past and immediate future. The lived abstraction of the event is an amodal perception, in the nonsensuous shape of a line, of change taking place. It is direct perception of an event. (Deleuze’s “time-image” is the prime example in his work of the appearing of the virtual in what would here be termed a semblance of an event; Deleuze 1989, 68–97 and passim).
