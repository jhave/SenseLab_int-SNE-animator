The annulment of powers of existence is all the more enfeebling when more than one figure are laid side by side on a single page. The disjunctive germ-space of pure contrast, flickering with the timelikeness of each markâ€™s virtual edge, disappears. The page is now a neutralized space of comparison. Difference is no longer active. Active contrast has been passified into an opposition: a planely separated either/or. Either the figures are the same, or they are not. Either they share an identity, or they do not. Sameness, or mutual exclusion.
