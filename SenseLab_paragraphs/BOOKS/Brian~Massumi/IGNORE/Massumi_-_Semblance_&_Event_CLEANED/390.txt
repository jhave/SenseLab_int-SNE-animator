Deleuze says of the diagram that it is “not a place, but rather a ‘nonplace’: a place only of changes” (1988a, 85). The universe of dance in which the event of the body’s self-abstraction nonsensuously occurs is not a “space.”12 It is a non-place, made only of forms of gestural change, bodily forms of transition, in a state of perpetual nascency. Each actual movement from which the dance self-detaches no sooner arises than it returns to the continually repeated variation from which it came. Each actual movement’s orientation is to repeated change, doubled by an accompanying alteration in the self-detaching nonsensuous order of nonlocal linkages. These qualitative-relational “movements which are their own ends” have “no direction in space” (Valéry 2003a, 28). They self-abstract from the space of actual bodily movement. Not into another space of the body doubling its actual world with another (as was the case with ritual dance), but rather into “Time” (Valéry 2003a, 31). The space of contemporary dance is a temporal realm of “acts” (31) whose incessant dissipation and rearising makes nonsensuously felt energetic bodily change, in a perpetually nascent state “emptied” of both human meaning and pragmatic potential for termination.13 Dance makes directly perceptually-felt time of the body expressing its potential for change.
