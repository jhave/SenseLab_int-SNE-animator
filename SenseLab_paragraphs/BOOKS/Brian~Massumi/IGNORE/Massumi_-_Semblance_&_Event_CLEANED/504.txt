The theory of the beautiful semblance, Benjamin says, is not just about art in the narrow sense. He makes it clear that it is also about politicality, and says explicitly that is “essential for metaphysics” as well. In his explosive fragment of a semblance as “smallest totality,” we can see James’s little absolute of “immediately given relation” (James 1996b, 280; see this book’s introduction). The semblance was defined in chapter 2 as a little absolute, which was in turn affirmed as the fundamental metaphysical reality from the perspective of a radical empirical philosophy and its twin sister speculative pragmatism. The little absolute, James was quoted as saying, includes its own other in its event in such a way that any identity it might be attributed, by whatever means, symbolic or otherwise, “telescopes and diffuses into other reals” (James 1996b, 272). Metaphysico-politically. Cosmopolitically.
