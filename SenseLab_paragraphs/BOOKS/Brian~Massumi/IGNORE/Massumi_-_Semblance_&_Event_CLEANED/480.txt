That question is, what is to be done? …. with content. In what way will the technique of existence play content between synchresis and concrescence? Will it empty its process of content, suspending itself in its contentreadiness, and if so, to what nonsensuous ends? If the technique suspends its process in content-readiness, how far will it take the suspension and how long will it maintain it? Into what Time of transformation will the technique of existence compose its content away? To the intensive end? Will it plant ways for its buds to resprout? If so, into what new concrescences, following what new world–lines, will they bourgeon? Or will the process revert to existing world-lines, tried and true?
