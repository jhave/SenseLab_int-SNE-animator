The relational-qualitative duplicity at the heart of activist philosophy is a differential, not a dichotomy. It concerns coincident differences in manner of activity between which things happen. The coming-together of the differences as such—with no equalization or erasure of their differential— constitutes a formative force. It is this force that provides the impulse that the coming experience takes into its occurrence and appropriates as its own tendency. Although the activity differentials are never erased, they do “compenetrate” to “harmonious” result. Between them, they co-compose a singular effect of unity resulting from how it is that they come differently together. An integral of action and experience—a dynamic unity of selfenjoying occurrence—emerges from the energetic playing out of their impulsive difference.
