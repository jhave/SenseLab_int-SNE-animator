The produced effect is a “floating feeling” (81). Your eye “ends up suspended in midair, midspace, or midstride” (76). This abstraction-effect is “not abstractable” itself (76). It resides in its own occurrence. It cannot be applied to something else, or taken elsewhere. It is right where it is, “mid”life. It is its own “unmediated presence” (87). Nothing more—or less—than a peculiar manner of vision suspended intensely in its own activity. Vision’s “self-possession divulging itself” (104) in a playing-out of a tension between its genetic elements. Divulging itself as “a quality, an energy” perceptually felt to self-move, “emerging” from the surface of the painting only to “dissolve itself . . . in a kind of entropic dissipation” (91) The rise and fall of quivering vision caught in a state of self-agitating nascency.
