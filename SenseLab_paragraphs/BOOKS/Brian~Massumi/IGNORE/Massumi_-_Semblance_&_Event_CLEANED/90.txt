It is not easy to arrive at a conception of a whole which is constructed from parts belonging to different dimensions. And not only nature, but also art . . . is such a whole. For . . . we lack the means of discussing in its constituent parts, an image which possesses simultaneously a number of dimensions. . . . But, in spite of all these difficulties, we must deal with the constituent parts in great detail. . . . Our courage may fail us when we find ourselves faced with a new part leading in a completely different direction, into new dimensions, perhaps into remoteness where the recollection of previously explored dimensions may easily fade. To each dimension, as, with the flight of time, it disappears from view, we should say: now you are becoming Past. But perhaps later at a critical—perhaps fortunate—moment we may meet again on a new dimension, and once again you may become Present. (Klee 1950, 15, 17)
