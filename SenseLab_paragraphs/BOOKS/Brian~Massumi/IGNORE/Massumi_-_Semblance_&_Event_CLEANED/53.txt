Pure: The word will return throughout this book in a refrain, doubtless to the discomfort of many a reader schooled in the critique of its conventional associations of moral superiority, particularly as regards race. It is used here in an unconventional sense, borrowed from James. “Pure” is James’s qualifier for the bare-active first flush of emergent experience. The just-emerging of experience is pure in the very specific sense that it is “virtually both subjective and objective” (James 1996a, 130). The general going-on of activity in the world has yet to sort itself out as what the special activity already brewing will determinately become. The dynamic unity of the coming event is still a work in progress. Since that forming dynamic unity will define the subjective form of the experience, what the subject will be is still an open question. As long as the subject lacks final definition, what its objects will have been in the end is also indeterminate. As is its objective bequest to subsequent experience. What is “given” is what will prove in the end to have been taken in. In the end, it is what will have passed on, potentially to be taken-in again. Pure in this context does not imply a hierarchy of value. It draws a question mark. It designates the open question of what experience’s self-creative activity will yield in the dynamic pulse of its process. Pure here is not an eliminative concept either. It marks the processual co-presence of a self-creating subject of experience with what will prove to have been its objects, together in the making. “Pure” experience is not in the least reduced or impoverished. It is overfull. It is brimming “virtually or potentially” (23). It is the embarrassment of processual riches in which every experience finds itself in its incipiency. “It is a that which is not yet any definite what, tho’ ready to be all sorts of whats” (93).
