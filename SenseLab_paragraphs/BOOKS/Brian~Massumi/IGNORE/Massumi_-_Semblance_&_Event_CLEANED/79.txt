Take a flash of lightning. Its appearance is conditioned by an electromagnetic differential. The differential does not show. What shows is the dynamic unity of the differential’s playing out. The flash comes of that playing-out, but shows for itself. The effect lifts off from its conditions into its own appearance. It is an extra-effect: a dynamic unity that comes in self-exhibiting excess over its differential conditions. In the immediacy of its own event, the event of lightning is absolutely, self-enjoyingly absorbed in the singularity of its own occurrence, and that’s what shows. All occasions  of  experience  exhibit  this  “sheer  individuality”  amid  diversity (Whitehead 1967a, 177). An event of experience is a “little absolute” of occurrent self-enjoyment, conditioned yet self-creating (James 1996b, 280). The event transpires between the differential elements that set the conditions for it. The electromagnetic gradient field that resolves itself into the occurrence of lightning is a complex field phenomenon. The field envelopes the distances between a multitude of elemental particles, bringing them into an energizing tension. The flash is the eventful resolution of the tension. It is how the field shows, in excess to itself, as an extra-effect. The exhibited extra-effect is an expression of that multitude of particles having come together just so, enveloped in tension. The intensive envelopment of the contributing elements constitutes a relational field—but only for the strike of this event. Had the lightning not occurred, it would have been because the contributing factors had not come together in just this way. The relation and the flash of eventful resolution are one. The flash is the being of the relation (Simondon 2005, 63). Had the flash not occurred, the relation would effectively not have been. It would not have resolved itself into an effect. In activist philosophy to be is to be felt: to effectively register.
