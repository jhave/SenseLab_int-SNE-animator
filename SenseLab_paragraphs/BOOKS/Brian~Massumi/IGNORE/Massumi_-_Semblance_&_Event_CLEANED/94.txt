Whenever we see, whenever we perceptually feel, whenever we live abstraction, we are taking in nonhuman occasions of experience. We are inheriting their activity, taking it into our own special activity as a human form of life: as a society of occasions of experience contributing to a continuing growth pattern it pleases us to call our human self. What we perceptually feel to be our “humanity” is a semblance of that life. Like all semblances, it is created through specific techniques of existence, in this case, of historic proportions. And like all semblances, it appears most for itself at the moment of its perishing (Foucault 1970, 422). The “human” is a singularly historical virtual reality appearing through the animal body it also pleases us to call human. “Humanity” is a growth ring expressing a certain episode in the historic route of the collective life  of  our animal body.
