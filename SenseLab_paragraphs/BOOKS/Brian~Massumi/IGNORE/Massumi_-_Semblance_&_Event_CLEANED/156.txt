There are practices, of course, that already do this implicitly to one degree or another, usually in a more determinate way, more narrowly focused on ensuring regular and dependable affordances, functional or instrumental perchings, rather than by sundering and fringing. What is architecture, if not “site-specific” life-design? What is an institution, if not a distributed architecture of experience? Architecture and institutions are two dynamically connected poles on a processual continuum between positioning and disposition, settling the present and disseminating settlement. A practice that pries open existing practices, of whatever category, scale, siting, or distribution, in a way that makes their potential reappear at a self-abstracting and self-differing distance from routine functioning, in a potentialized semblance of themselves—variational practice of that kind could be called (to borrow the felicitous term Rafael Lozano-Hemmer applies to his own approach to interactive art) a relational architecture (Massumi 2000). A relational architecture is oriented toward the disseminating end of things, toward potential expansion, but is anti-institutional. It unsettles. It pushes the dispositional envelope of the processual continuum  just  mentioned.
