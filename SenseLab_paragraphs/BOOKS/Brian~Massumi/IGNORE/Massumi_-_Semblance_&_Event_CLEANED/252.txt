VII
How could we ever literally see a unitary form or figure when the light striking our eye is splintered into countless separate points by the rods and cones populating the retina? Gloss over the gaps. How could we literally see a continuous surface-surround of space when our very own nose sunders our field of vision in twoâ€”not to mention the holes poked in both halves by the blindspot of each eye? Bridge it over. How could we see depth when our retinas are two-dimensional to begin with, even before what they register is poked, sundered, and splintered? Superadd it. We see unity of form in excess of our eyes.
