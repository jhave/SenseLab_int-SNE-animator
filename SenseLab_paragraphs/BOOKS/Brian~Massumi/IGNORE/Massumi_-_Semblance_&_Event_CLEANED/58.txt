The speculative aspect relates to the character of potential native to the world’s activity, as expressed eventfully in the taking place of change. The pragmatic aspect has to do with how, in the taking-definite-shape of potential in a singular becoming, the relational and qualitative poles co-compose as formative forces. Pragmatic doesn’t mean practical as opposed to speculative or theoretical. It is a synonym for composition: “how” processual differentials eventfully play out as co-composing formative forces. This pragmatic playing out is always speculative in the sense that what will come of the process is to some degree an open question until its “final characterization” of itself at its point of culmination. En route, it is speculatively anticipating what it will have been. That speculation is entirely active. It is the “how” of the experience getting where it’s ultimately going with itself. The co-composing of formative forces constitutes in each exercise of experience a novel power of existence: a power to become.
