The only thing that is certain is that the body will have partaken. It will have taken something of the world’s general activity into its own special activity of expressing potential in life-advancing change taking place. Matter, “considered in abstraction of the notion of life,” leads to an impasse. “We are left with the notion of an activity in which nothing is effected” (Whitehead 1968, 148). Nothing doing. “Vacuous actuality” (Whitehead 1978, 29). Inactivist philosophy.
