In chapter 3, the drawing of a peculiar alteration which exerts a power of transposition that creatively extends a manner of seeing into a form-oflife, understood as a complex manner of being/being able/knowing/ wanting appearing eventfully together in virtual mutual inclusion, was termed a diagram (Deleuze 2004b, 81–90). The diagram was considered a technique of existence. Conversely, every technique of existence can be considered a diagram. Valéry treats Degas’s drawing as a diagram. Deleuze corroborates Valéry’s main point: “the suprasensible diagram is not to be confused with the audio-visual archive” (Deleuze 1988a, 84, translation modified). It “doubles” the order of sensuous forms and their history with a “becoming of forces” (manners of being/being capable/knowing/wanting) (Deleuze 1988a, 85; translation modified). Semblance and diagram-as-technique-of-existence go doubly, becoming together.
