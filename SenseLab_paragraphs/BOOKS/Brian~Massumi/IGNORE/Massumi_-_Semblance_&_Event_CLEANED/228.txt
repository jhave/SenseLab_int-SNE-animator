The spectrum is convivial. It is always in the company of darkness. The range of achromatic variation forms a larger encompassing whole against the background of which the spectrum appears. “Color and illumination constitute . . . an indissoluble unity. . . . One illumination with its colors emerges from the other, and merges back into it; they are both indicators and bearers of each other” (Katz 1935, 294).
Bearers of each other, triggered into being by an edge. The convivial edge of emergence: one line indicating all, presenting the continuity of variation that is the shadowy background of existence. And at the same time effecting separation: the spectral distinction of what actually appears. Merging; emerging. Virtual; actual. One line.
