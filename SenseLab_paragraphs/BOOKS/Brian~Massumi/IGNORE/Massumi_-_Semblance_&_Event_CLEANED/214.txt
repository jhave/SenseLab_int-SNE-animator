Mixing as a concept just doesn’t go very far either. It has the same limitations as the concept of meta-medium. It’s just a general name for the mapping operations that meta-media theory attributes to digital technology. Both concepts repose on the concept of connectivity. The “mapping” is a charting of interconnectivity—what I talked about earlier as local partto-part connection. Extrinsic rather than immanent relation. These concepts don’t sufficiently problematize interactivity.
