Subject and object are given operative definitions by pragmatism. They are not placed in any kind of metaphysical contradiction or opposition. They are defined additively (James 1996a, 9), according to their multiple takings-up in events, in a continuing movement of integration and decoupling, phasing and dephasing, whose dynamic takes precedence over their always provisional identities. Subject and object are grasped directly as variations—not only of themselves but of each other. Their open-ended ability to cross over into each other is the very “stuff” of the world (James 1996a, 4). As it is of experience. The phrase “the world of experience” is a redundancy.
