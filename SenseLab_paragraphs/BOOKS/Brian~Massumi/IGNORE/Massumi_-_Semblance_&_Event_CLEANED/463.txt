The perception of perception occurring is not the subjective viewpoint of the gallery visitor. The experience takes: it takes its own time; it takes elements into itself; and it takes in the catalytic sense of an effect setting in, or the combustive sense of a slow detonation. The experience belongs not to any one element, but to their coming-together in just this way. It comes of a “nexus” (Weschler 1982, 64). The human element of the gallery visitor is, to be sure, a privileged link in the nexus. But from the point of view of the technique of existence taking expression, the human element is less the center than the conduit for the expressive event’s culmination. It is there for feeling the nexus (Whitehead 1978, 230), to give it determinate subjective form. The experiential effect occurs to the visitor, as it occurs to itself as its own event, through the conduit of the visitor. The effect wells up from below the threshold of human awareness. It comes to pass the threshold in its way, following its own rhythm, when it is ready to set in. It—the event-nexus—expresses its own coming-together, as it passes through its human-channeled bringing-itself-into-perceptual-focus. This makes the experience integrally ecological.
