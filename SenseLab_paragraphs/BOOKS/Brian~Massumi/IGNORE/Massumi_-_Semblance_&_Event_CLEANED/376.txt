To understand these drawings as a whole
one has to
1) leave the written page
to enter into
the real
but
2) leave the real
to enter into
the surreal
the extra-real …
into which these drawings keep on
plunging
seeing as they come from here and seeing as they are in fact …
but the figuration on paper
of an élan
that took place and produced magnetically and magically its effects
and seeing as these drawings are not the
representation or the figuration
of an object or a state of
mind or fear,
of a psychological
element or event,
they are purely and simply the reproduction on paper
of a magical
gesture
(Artaud 1948, 34–35)
