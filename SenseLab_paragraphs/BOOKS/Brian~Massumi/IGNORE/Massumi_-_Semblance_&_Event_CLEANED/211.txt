V2 This has been a long conversation, and you haven’t used the word “media” once, except maybe in the stock phrase “new media.” It’s a word that’s all over the place in interactive art. Why have you shied away from this concept?
BM  Because I don’t think it is one. I mean, I think the concept of media is in crisis. It’s in tatters. That’s because the digital isn’t a medium, but it’s currently dominating the media field. Digital technology is an expanding network of connective and fusional potentials. You can take an input in any sense modality, and translate or transduce it into any other, say sound into image. You can take any existing genre of artistic practice and fuse it with any other, say animation with cinema. Digital technology has no specificity as a medium in its own right. That is why commentators like Lev Manovich call it a “meta-medium” (2005). But that doesn’t get you very far. From there, the best you can do is catalogue the kinds of connections that are possible and chart their permutations. It leads to an encyclopedic approach. At best, it gives you a combinatory flowchart, what Manovich calls a remix map. It entirely shelves the question of art and artfulness. It doesn’t give you any vocabulary to think the properly aesthetic dimension, what makes digital art “art.”
