Seeing, he says, is a kind of action. Only, I would say, without the actual action—with the action appearing in potential.  We never just register what’s actually in front of our eyes. With every sight we see imperceptible qualities, we abstractly see potential, we implicitly see a life dynamic, we virtually live relation. It’s just a kind of shorthand to call it an object. It’s an event. An object’s appearance is an event, full of all sorts of virtual movement. This is real movement, because something has happened: the body has been capacitated. It’s been relationally activated. It is alive in the world, poised for what may come. That is also “seen”—there’s a sense of aliveness that accompanies every perception. We don’t just look, we sense ourselves alive. Every perception comes with its own “vitality affect,” to use a term of Daniel Stern’s (Stern 1985, 53–61; Stern 2010).
