Filter as a technique of existence may, chance always enters in, to one degree or another. There is always inflection. Modulation is the rule. The necessary incoming of  chance toward  the outcome of  the experiential event  gives  newness  to  every  event.  It  makes  every  occurrence  the appearance of a novelty. Every event a creative event. This is speculativepragmatic fact, ever redefining itself, in process. Fact is definiteness. Novelty is inexplicable in terms of already-defined, objective or sensuous, forms. The definiteness of fact is due to a creative movement continuing behind, across, and through objective encounters.
The definiteness of fact is due to its forms; but the individual fact is a creature, and creativity is the ultimate behind all forms, inexplicable by forms. . . . The novel entity is at once the togetherness of the “many” which it finds, and also it is one among the disjunctive “many” which it leaves; it is a novel entity, disjunctively among the many entities which it synthesizes. . . . Thus the “production of novel togetherness” is the ultimate notion embodied in the term “concrescence.” . . . “Creativity” is the universal of universals. . . . The “creative advance” is the application of this ultimate principle to each novel situation it originates. (Whitehead 1978, 20–21)
