Once the emphasis is placed on the transitional-definitional nature of the “terminus,” it is clear that the identity of the event’s elements cannot predate their integration. What the object will definitely have been, and what precisely will have been role of the subjects, is clear only in retrospect after each integration—by which time they are already in transit to another terminus. Already all over again in the making. James will go so far as to say that what constitutes a subject and an object varies. An element that was a subject at one terminus may be taken up as an object in the next, or function as both at the same time (James 1996a, 13–15, 56–57). This is obvious when you remember that as a perceiver you are always perceivable by another, in whose experience you figure as an object. Or that an object may be retaken up as a memory, crossing from objective to subjective status (James 1996a, 61).
