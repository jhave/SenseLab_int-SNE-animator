Mahler composed-away for an absoluteness of music. He effected a singular becoming-sound of extra-musical elements. However, he did this in a way that was not apt to lead outside musical activity as he and his time generically knew it. Leakage into the surroundings of the music hall was included-out, even as the surroundings were grandiosely taken-in. The becoming of orchestral music he invented was designed to be self-returning. He peculiarly altered the vitality affects of musical activity, but retained its affective tonality as music. He figures prominently in the annals of music history.
