The speculative nature of language is underlined by James’s remark that in the ambulatory meaning-and-truth process any actual movements advancing meaningfully along world-lines present themselves first virtually, in a pre-thinking-speaking of their terminus. Language projects world-lines in advance of themselves. It foretraces. Truthsaying is the language-assisted translation of virtually thought-felt foretracings into actually followed action-paths. If the action-path terminates in sense-perception as the tending-toward speculatively anticipated, it is because the unfolding event has succeeded in navigating the welter of the world. The event’s unfolding has accomplished a preoriented selection of intermediary linkages advancing stepwise through sensuous experience, aided at every turn by a backgrounded universe of unspoken, barely thought presuppositions.
