The dance is the conversion of the body’s movement in space into the Time of its alteration: its speculative translation into a universe of pure bodily becoming. The life of the body unlimited, in a pure experience of its becoming. Semblance of life. Embodied life: pure expression of the body’s aliveness. Animateness as such.
