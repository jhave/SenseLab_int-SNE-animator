When a human form is taken as a point of departure, the drawing is the appearing of a complex form of life: a multiplicity of vitality affects are mutually included in an event of vision, enveloped in the affective tonality of the sight of the drawing, and appearing virtually to “reconstitute someone” (Valéry 2003ba, 207). The more exact the representation, the more “detestable” the drawing (Valéry 2003cb, 81). The more intense the perceptual feeling of form-of-life, the more successful the drawing. And paradoxically, the more intense the perceptual feeling, the more impersonal the drawing becomes (“someone”). The reconstitution is not of a particular “someone,” since the drawing has taken great pains to depart from any such focus on representing. The “peculiar alteration” the drawing suffers makes it commit a “personal error” (Valéry 2003ba, 207; emphasis in the original). It makes an art that is purportedly of the personal, creatively “err” in that apparent vocation. It makes a self-respecting semblance of it again.
