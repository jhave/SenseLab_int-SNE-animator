This is an example of a compositional technique for out-treating sources for the  adventitious or  parasitic growth of  content affecting music  by taking in a bud of content of a favored kind. The selected bud is so tightly embraced, so excessively included, that it comes vividly alive for the technique of existence adopting it. It becomes-immanent to the expressive force of the event. The intensity of that inclusion edges out all rival content-readiness. This strategy is that of composing-away. Mahler invented a creative strategy for composing-away, and lived it out in an exclusive dedication to the potential intensities of one genre of expressive technique of existence, that of the symphonic music of his time.
