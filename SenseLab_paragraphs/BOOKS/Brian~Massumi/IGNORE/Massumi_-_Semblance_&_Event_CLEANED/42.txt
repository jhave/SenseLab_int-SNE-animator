Disjunctive relations are felt as a self-distancing coming out of an initial condition of participation in the quasi-chaotic something-doing that is the general condition of activity in the world. Conjunctive relations are felt as a “tendency” or “striving” (166–167) that continues across thresholds often marked by resistances and obstacles. “The word ‘activity’ has no imaginable content whatever save these experiences of process, obstruction, striving, strain, or release.” These are “ultimate qualia” (James 1996a, 166–167). It is artificial to oppose disjunctive relations to conjunctive relations. How could each occasion of experience not involve both: a disjunctive coming-out of prior participation, and a quality of continuing-across enabled by that separation? Strains, obstructions, and resistances mark the continued formative pressure of the quasi-chaotic manyness of the oceanic somethings-doings all around on the singular “drop” of experience in the self-creating (James 1996b, 231–232). Ingressions of bare-active relation pulse the event, modulating its onward phasing. Every event is a qualitative-relational economy of process, “full of both oneness and manyness” (James 1996a, 93–94): The continuities and the discontinuities are absolutely co-ordinate matters of immediate feeling. The conjunctions are as primordial elements of “fact” as are the distinctions and disjunctions. In the same act by which I feel that this passing minute is a new pulse of my life, I feel that the old life continues into it, and the feeling of continuance in no wise jars upon the simultaneous feeling of a novelty. They, too, compenetrate harmoniously. (95)
