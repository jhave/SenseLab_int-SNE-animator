Whitehead defines objectivity in terms of activity that has been left over in the world by previous events of change and that can be taken up by a next event for taking-in to its self-creation. The object is the “datum” in the etymological sense. It is the “given”: that which is actively found already in the world, to be taken for formative potential. The “subject” is what finds itself in the midst of these processual leavings, taking them up as the world’s gift of potential for its own taking-form. The “subjective” is not something preexisting to which an event occurs: it is the self-occurring form of the event. The dynamic unity of an occasion of experience is its “subjective form.” Actually, there is no “the” subject. There is no subject separate from the event. There is only the event as subject to its occurring to itself. The event itself is a subjective self-creation: the how-now of this singular self-enjoyment of change taking place. (For all these points, see Whitehead 1967a, 175–190, and 1978, 41, 52.)
