Whitehead remarked that in the highly abstractive movement of language, nonsensuous perceptions may detach so thoroughly from objects that the “sense-perceived meanings” are entirely lost. Crucial for the present account, the direct perception of their relations is not lost. Direct perception of relational qualities of movement and change continues with the movement of language. Affective attunement continues. The nonsensuous universe of life’s qualities of relation goes on expanding. The living of life’s abstraction goes on going on.
