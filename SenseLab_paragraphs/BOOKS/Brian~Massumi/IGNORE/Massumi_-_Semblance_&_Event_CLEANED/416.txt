The preparation may be classifiable as “naturally” occurring (on physical, chemical, biological, geological, and meteorological strata, to name a few). But when they are “human” or “cultural” they are always also natural. There is no event of human experience without a body with senses to amodally combine. There are no bodily senses in flights of dynamic interplay without a ground to stand on. There are no technological extensions of the body’s life of abstraction in the absence of creative differentials of the electromagnetic and metallurgical kind, among themselves and between their respective strata and others. The conditions for events of expression presuppose a nature-culture continuum from which the differential elements brought disjunctively into play are selectively drawn, to just this effect for each event.
