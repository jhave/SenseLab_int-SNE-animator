The concept of the virtual is taken up at length in the course of the book under the guise of semblance. Semblance is another way of saying “the experience of a virtual reality.” Which is to say: “the experiential reality of the virtual.” The virtual is abstract event potential. Semblance is the manner in which the virtual actually appears. It is the being of the virtual as lived abstraction. As used here, “semblance” is free of the connotations of “illusion” in Adorno’s and Lacan’s uses of the term.
