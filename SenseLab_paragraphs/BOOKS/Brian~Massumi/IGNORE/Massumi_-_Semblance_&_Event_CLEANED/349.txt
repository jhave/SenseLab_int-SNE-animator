This perceptual feeling in vision of spaces thought-seen beyond the sensuous ken of sight might be dismissed as a mere hallucination—were it not for the years of hard training, the practiced technique, and the meticulously prepared collective context necessary for the event of its performance. If this is  hallucination, it is not  “just” a hallucination. It  is a collective availing of the creative powers of the false incumbent in all experience. It is less a hallucination in the pejorative sense than an invoked relational reality. That is what ritual does: it invokes into occurring a collectively shared nonsensuous experience of a cosmological kind. This is a speculative dance of the imagination: a cosmological semblance of a truth, abstractly lived, with all due amodal intensity.
