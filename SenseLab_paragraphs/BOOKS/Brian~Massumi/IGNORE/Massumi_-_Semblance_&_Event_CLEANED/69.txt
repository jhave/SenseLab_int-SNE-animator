The virtual cannot be understood as a “space” of potential—it is, after all, event potential. It cannot be treated as a realm apart without being entirely denatured as a speculatively-pragmatically useful concept. It is in no way an idealist concept. And it is in no way in opposition with actualism. The activist philosophy advanced here is in a way a thoroughgoing actualism, taking the term actual at its etymological word: “in act.” For activist philosophy, everything real gets into the act, and everything in the act is real according to its own mode of activity.
