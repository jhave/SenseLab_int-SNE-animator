The last traces of the sensible go mute, leaving pure unverbalized thought. Reenaction purified of any trace of sense modality: pure amodal reality. No longer beholden to the empirical order of the senses, thought, at the limit, throws off the shackles of reenaction. It becomes directly enactive—of virtual events. It becomes purely, virtually active, producing nonsensuous similarities: activation contours never felt, but already virtually reverberating; abstract dynamic forms of future-feeling; vitality affects awaiting encounter. Language cannot reach this directly future-feeling limit of thought. But in imagination, it can approach it. When it does, words resonate with virtual thought-events lying on the linguistic horizon. Language fore-echoes with amodal invention. It vibrates with nonsensuously inventive activity. It becomes-active in resonance with pure thought. It is this partnership with pure thought that makes language the “most complete archive” of “semblances in which nothing”—that is, pure thought, pure amodal reality—“appears.”
