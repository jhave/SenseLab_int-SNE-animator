Mahler’s technique of existence insistently rephased on a becoming more intensely and absolutely itself. Irwin’s dephased toward becoming more expansively other, without ever compromising on the purity of its own aim for intensity. Mahler invented a new mode of musical perception, keeping it tightly wound around itself, and without highlighting the perception of that perception. Irwin invented new modes of perception in expanding circles while foregrounding the perception-of-perception at every step, making the pure act of expression expansively self-referential rather  than  tightly  self-returning.  Mahler  embraced  the  speculative production of  a universe  of  music. Irwin’s  speculative  creativity went ambulatory in the world in a way that intensely foretraced pragmatic movements in urban potential.
