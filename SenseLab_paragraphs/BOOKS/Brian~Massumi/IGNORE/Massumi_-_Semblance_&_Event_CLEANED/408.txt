“Aliveness”: not the same as “live.” Aliveness is the relational quality of life. It is a semblance: a nonsensuous similarity. Like all nonsensuous similarity, it self-detaches from the objective combinations of things that go into a live performance, doubling them with an order of lived abstraction. A priori, there is no reason to believe that a dance or music recording deanimates the expressive event. Since the aliveness of the performance detaches itself from the performance even as it happens, there is no reason it cannot survive a second remove. What is certain is that it cannot survive a second remove—or even a repeat live performance—unchanged.
This is because the conditions of production or reproduction of an event, in all their singularity and genericness, are just as active as “extra” ingredients in the expression as any other factors. Such contextual factors as the unique acoustics, and even the mood of the listener or the collective “feel” of the audience, are as fusionally ingredient to the quality of experience of a piece of music in a given iteration as is the plucking of strings. Given the kinesthetic-proprioceptive tenor of musical hearing, the iPod’s launching of the experience of music into everyday movement can be expected to become powerfully immanent to how the technique of existence of music can make itself felt, and what expressively it can do.
