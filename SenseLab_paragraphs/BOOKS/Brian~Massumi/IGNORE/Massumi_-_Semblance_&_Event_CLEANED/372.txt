Returning representation fully to the status of the semblance, freed of its pretense to the truth, means peculiarly departing from the representation in such a way as to reimpart an impersonal force of vitality to what otherwise, “realistically” speaking, would appear to be personal. Valéry’s “someone” is Deleuze’s “fourth person singular” (Deleuze 1990, 141). Not some particular person but a form of life “in person”—directly perceptually felt in all its abstract intensity, qualitatively-relationally more-than objectively real. Not inner being: “extra-being” (Deleuze 1990, 7). The drawing has yielded from sensuous form an event of extra-being. Art of this kind is best called “figural,” to distinguish it from the representational (“figurative”) art from which it departs (Deleuze 2004b, 10–13, 31–38; Manning 2009b, 170–183).
