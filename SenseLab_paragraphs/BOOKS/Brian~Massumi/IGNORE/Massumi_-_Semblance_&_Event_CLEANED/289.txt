We are presented with a double existence whenever we perceive a movement involving a change of state. With the dot, the change was a disappearance. With the balls, it was causal, an impact effecting a launch. It could be any number of other things, as well: for example, a “tunneling” (one object ‘seen’ to pass behind another and come out the other side); an “entraining” (one object approaching another and dragging or carrying it off); an “ampliation” (a relay or spread of movement); an attraction, repulsion, or resistance; or, suggestively, an “animation” (a self-propulsion). The variations are endless. But what they all have in common is that accompanying a plurality of forms or a combination of sensory inputs there is a felt-perception of something unitary: a continuing across that seamlessly links the separate elements or inputs as belonging to the same change.
