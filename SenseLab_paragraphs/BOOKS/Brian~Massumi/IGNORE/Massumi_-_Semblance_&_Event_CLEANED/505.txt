Benjamin seems to agree. But he insists on the metaphysico-political point, also grappled with by radical empiricism and speculative pragmatism, that immediately given relation is a nonrelation. “The expressionless,” Benjamin writes, is that critical violence which, “while unable to separate semblance from truth in art, prevents them from mingling.” The composing-away of truth and content is actually a kind of separative composing-with: together, but separate, disjunct, in differential tension. Intensely, duplicitously. Synchretically-conscrescently.
Is “critical violence” but a duplicitous way of explosively holding in reserve buds of content for a blossoming to come? Does the “the power of the expressionless” tend already toward a “telescoping and diffusing into other reals”—coming potentials a world-walk away from that explosive non-place of art  as  a  place  only  of  changes?  Might  the  suspension of the beautiful semblance give the expressionless legs? The better to worldline with? Does quivering life struck with “critical violence” bleed expanding life?
