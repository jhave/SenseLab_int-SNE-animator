Irwin recounts that his early artistic activity in the 1940s and 1950s in representational portrait drawing left him unsatisfied, even though it won him accolades and awards (Weschler 1982, 29–38). He felt as though he were going through the motions. It lacked intensity. He felt the need to purify his art of the “taken-for-granted”: “pictorial or articulate reading of images on any principled grounds (81).” He would “suspend such conventions as much as possible” (81), purifying the work of “representation” and “imagist associations” (61). The artwork “wouldn’t be ‘about’ anything” (65). It would have no content, it would be pared down to its own “act” (81). “Everything that didn’t” actively “contribute” would be “filtered out” (63). Nothing would be left that did not become to a contributory force immanent to the effecting of the act. The artwork would be full of “movement,” but it would no longer be “extensive” (69). Intensity would be restored to the work when it made the motions—when it was composed in such a way that it immanently energized its own act. It would then be a “nonobject” (81): purely its own self-occurring event.
