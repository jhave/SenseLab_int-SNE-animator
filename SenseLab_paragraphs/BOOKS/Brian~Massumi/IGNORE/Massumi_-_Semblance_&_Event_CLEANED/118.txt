This brings us to James’s pivotal definition of what constitutes a radical empiricism, and when coupled with pragmatism, precludes it being an instrumentalism: the primacy of relation. The world revolves around its momentous relation to itself. Relations, James insists, are as real as the terms in relation (subjects, objects, sense data). And relations are themselves experienced.
The relations that connect experience must themselves be experienced relations, and any kind of relation experienced must be accounted as “real” as anything else in the system. (James 1996a, 42)
