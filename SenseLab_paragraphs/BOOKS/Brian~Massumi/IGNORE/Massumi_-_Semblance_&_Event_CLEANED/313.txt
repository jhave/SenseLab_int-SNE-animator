If we apply this to the examples of object perception used earlier, where there seemed to be an implicit presupposition of a passive subject observing a scene, it is now clear that the “spectator” was as directly involved as the billiard balls or cars were. The spectator is just as absorbed in the collision, on the level of his nascent actions. He is riveted into affective attunement, in instantaneous reenaction. Action is only half the event: action-reenaction; rhythm-reverberation; point, virtual counterpoint. Thus everything that was just said of the parent-child relation applies to the direct perception of change involving what we normally think of as constituted objects entering into combination. What is happening is a new occurrence of the primary coming-together in qualitative relation that, ontogenetically speaking, is prior to any separation of self-identities following their individual world-lines. In every event of perception, there is a differential co-involvement in the dynamic unity of one and the same occurrence. The differential is between roles, or manners of direct involvement in the event (active, reenactive; rhythmic, reverbatory). Every movement has an activation contour, a rhythm of activity: vitality affect. Affective tonality, for its part, comes with reenaction. It occurs between the action and the reenaction, the rhythm and the reverberation, expressing their mutual inclusion in the same event. The affective tonality—the excitement of dropping a billiard ball in a pocket, the fear of a car crash, the soothe of a gesture—is no less a constitutive factor than the respective events’ activation contours. It comes flush with the instantaneous between of their action-reenaction.
