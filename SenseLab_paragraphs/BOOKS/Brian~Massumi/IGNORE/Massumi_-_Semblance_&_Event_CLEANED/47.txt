From the perspective of activist philosophy, philosophy should not overcome the cognitivist problem. The best approach is: don’t go there. Not going cognitive requires only a slight displacement, James explains. Consider the subjective and the objective as ways in which portions of experience—pulses of process—relate to each other (James 1996a, 196). What cognitivist philosophy grapples with as an essential divide, activist philosophy sees as “successive takings” by experience, in experience, of itself (James 1996a, 105). Here there can be no fundamental  doubt. Doubt as hard as you can, and all you have done is emphatically illustrate one of the ways experience is wont to take itself back up into itself, selfformatively. You have found yourself in doubt—no doubt a real event. Doubt took effect. A doubter you just effectively became. Activist philosophy is thoroughly realist. It affirms the reality of any and all takings-effect. Its question is not whether something is real or not. It is not out to disqualify, or eliminate. Rather, it asks what aspects of process an event’s taking-effect exemplifies. This effective realism even applies to the subject and object distinction, the conventional formulations of which it is so wary.
