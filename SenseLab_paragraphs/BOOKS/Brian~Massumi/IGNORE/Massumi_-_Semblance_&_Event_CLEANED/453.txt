“Some time will pass” (91). It takes time for the effect to build up and self-combust. The fusion-effect detaches from the surface of the canvas into a no place of the floating in-between. The effect is nonlocal. It is nowhere in particular. It is a whole-field effect. Where it effectively comes from is not strictly speaking a space either, but an elemental relational field. The objective space of seeing has been self-possessed by vision, and in the process converted into an abstract time of the thinking-feeling of vision. Semblance of sight.
The thinking-feeling of vision’s self-possession is on one level a playing out of a differential relation (of nonrelation) between ingredient elements becoming immanent to its event. Simultaneously, on another level, it is a way of vision relating to its own occurrence: a self-relating of vision. This is a duplex event. A double experience. Experience of a double ordering. The sensuous order of local signs is seen to cede to a thinking-feeling of nonsensuous linkage in an overall fusion-effect. Vitality affects of vision are seen to emerge-together away from their surface, and dissolve into each other. The affective tonality in which they are enveloped, and in which the singular quality of the event consists, concerns only this abstract movement—which is the very movement of abstraction. The perception is not of something in particular. It is a perception of perception (92). It is a thinking-feeling of what experientially it means to perceive. A direct, immediate consciousness of the world’s ever-ongoing self-abstraction, intensely exemplified. A kinesthetic-proprioceptive glimpse of the qualitative-relational universe of its experiential becoming.
