Remember that the vanishing point makes the perspectival artwork selfembracing as a whole. This makes it the semblance of a harmonious world, even though the scene it contains is actually partial. It is a self-embracing harmonious whole because the spatial ordering doesn’t fade out with the actually perceptible contents. Quite the reverse, the fading-out of the content makes the order come back around, to complete a circuit. The spatial order wraps back around to surround the fringes of the frame, giving a definite present a boundary to the infinity it holds. This offsets the infinity of the world of the painting from its immediate surroundings. As a result, it enjoys a self-embracing autonomy from what’s actually around it. The same goes for the kingdom: it is an infinitely self-embracing order that is nevertheless offset from other kingdoms around it, and from other political formations (even if they share the same actual territory, as with the budding bourgeoisie that was already beginning to bubble up, in what Marx called the “pores” of soon-to-be ancien régime—in the gaps created by its self-distancing).
