Site-specificity and disposition. Monadology and nomadology. These are not dualities. They are polarities, dynamic orientations in an abstract qualitative map of potential experience. The map is always multi-polar. All of these contrasting modes virtually map each other, ripple into each other, canceling each other out or combining and amplifying, cresting and troughing, for calm and for turbulence, for continuing and turning back in, for immanence and  outliving. Any way it goes, we always live at a unique crossroads of them. Each moment is carried by the current of a singular-generic fusion of all of them, mutually foregrounded or backgrounded, active to varying intensity in the formative stir of the field of emergence of experience.
