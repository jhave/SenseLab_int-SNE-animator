The objective extraction of identity arises out of movement. Vision’s synesthetic result stands on an oscillating kinesthetic “ground.” Perceived stability and order emerge from perceptual chaos. Vision is the process of that passage: from the giddiness of light-struck eyes to the practical grip of abstract oversight. From the invisible abyss of the proto-figural to relative objective clarity.
Each time eye jitter draws an edge with the world’s continual variation, a whole universe of potential abstractly appears to vision in the form of a particular object among others, inhabiting the same order in space and time. The edge effects a synesthetic-kinesthetic emergence layering levels (objective foreground /background, potential next, virtual continuity) and an ordering of identities (in an emergent space-time of experience).
