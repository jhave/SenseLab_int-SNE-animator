Take the way a simple object is doubled by its own “likeness.” You don’t just have an experience of the single present thing. You at the same time experience what it’s like to experience its presence. That “likeness” marks the object as a variation on itself. You perceive what it’s like because in your life there have been other appearings “like” this one, and you implicitly anticipate more will come. The likeness is the invisible sign of a continuing. This puts a certain distance between the object and itself. A kind of self-abstraction. The thing stands for itself, and for difference from itself over time. Because in time it will appear episodically, under variation. It holds these variations-on in the present, which is why it is a kind of immediate, lived abstraction. This haloes the object with certain genericness, extending what it is beyond its own particularity. The thing is both itself and a placeholder in life’s process for others like it. The semblance is the leading edge, in the present, of future variation, and at the same time a doppler from variations past. It is the thing’s perceived margin of changeability, the thinking-feeling of potential appearings of particulars belonging to the same genre, appearing in the same style. A semblance is a direct perception of a life style. It is like an intuition of the thing as a life motif—a pattern of varied repetitions.
