Whitehead’s term for it is “pure feeling.” Philosophy, for him, is nothing less than a “critique of pure feeling” (Whitehead 1978, 113). In the pages that follow, whenever the word pure is used, the reader should think of the displacement that activist philosophy effects in relation to the notions of subject and object and the paradigms of cognition within which they are normally embedded. The crucial point is that it does this out of respect for the richness of experience in the making. In this connection, it is especially important not to equate “pure” experience with “raw” experience.
