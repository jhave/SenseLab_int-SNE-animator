Rather than a dichotomy, the relational-qualitative duplicity in  the midst of which activist philosophy begins is a principle of co-composition between coincident manners of occurring. As a principle it is specifically designed to disable the traditional dichotomies haunting Western philosophy. The differential involved cannot, for example, be overlaid on the subject-object dichotomy. The duplicity concerns activity and the potential for the appearance of novelty astir in it. Neither potential nor activity is object-like. They are more energetic than object-like (provided that no presuppositions are made as to the physicality of “energy” or the modes of causality involved in the energizing of events). For the basic category they suggest is just that: occurrence. Neither object nor subject: event.
