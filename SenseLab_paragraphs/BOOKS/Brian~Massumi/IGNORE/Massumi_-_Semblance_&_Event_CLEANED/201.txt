The toggling back to the fusional-relational pole is most intensely felt a when the separating-out of the sense modes is taken to an extreme. This is when a sense is made to do only what it can do. At that limit of what it can do, its relational conditions of emergence appear, as if experience returned through a wormhole to the other end of its universe in no time at all. Fusion effects spark, but so much in no-time-at-all that the vitality affect, the most outstanding lived quality of the experiential event, is in another sense mode, lived-out the other side of the wormhole. Incidentally, it is in the wormhole that James’s “pure experience” resides.
This is what I was talking about with kinesthesic and haptic vision: how they are pure optical appearances of other-sense qualities of life. What’s potentially instructive for art is more how the senses inhabit each other, even at the acme of their separation, than any putative domination of one by the other. The senses are always also taking each other up, coming into and out of each other in one way or another, worming their way around (Massumi 2002, 144–176). They never function alone. What we call the ocularcentric “domination” of vision over the other senses is in fact a highly functionalized and systematized cross-modal connection between vision and touch. Look forth and grasp, and have toolful dominion over the earth . . . the real issue is not so much the supposed domination of vision, it’s the excessive instrumentalization of its interaction with tactility. “Ocularcentrism” is a certain interacto-centrism, technoscientifically enhanced.
