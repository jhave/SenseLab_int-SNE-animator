It’s what Spinoza would call “conatus.” The formations communicated with each other through the abstract coupling of an affect with an effect, which because of its abstract qualitative nature could not be touched by any actually present cause. Simondon calls the kind of analog contagion between different but resonating formations of which this an example transduction in order to distinguish it from linear causality, with its ban on action at a distance and its presumption of actual, local, part-to-part connection (Simondon 2005, 31–33, 107–110 and passim).
