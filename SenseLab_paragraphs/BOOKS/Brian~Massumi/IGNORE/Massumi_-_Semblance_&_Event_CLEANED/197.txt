When I said that what interactive art can do is take a situation as its “object,” that it could live up to its potential by then cleaving the interactions it situated asunder, I meant something like this, but done with and through interactions. Not suspending them altogether, but opening microintervals in them, so that there is a rhythm of departure and return between nonsensuous perception of affective continuity on the one hand, and on the other hand actually emergent drops of narrativizable experience precipitating determinate words and instrumentalizable experience precipitating gestures. When I say this, I’m not endorsing Nicolas Bourriaud’s way of talking about relational art. From my perspective, his “relational” remains too wed to notions of interaction understood in terms of mediated intersubjective exchange. I’m talking about immediation, immediately lived relation (chapter 4).
