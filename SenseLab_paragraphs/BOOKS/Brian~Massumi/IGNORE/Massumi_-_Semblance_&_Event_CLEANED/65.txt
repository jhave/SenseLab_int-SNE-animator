The diagram as technique of existence is a way of informing the next occasion of these potentials for self-formation: “The greatest point of art consists in the introduction of suitable abstractions” (Peirce 1997, 226). It should not for a moment be forgotten that all of this concerns experience. In experience is to be found the genesis of things. By abstraction, Peirce writes, “I mean such a transformation of our diagrams that characters of one diagram may appear in another as things” (ibid.). What we call objects, considered in the ontogenetic fullness of process, are lived relations between the subjective forms of occasions abstractly nesting themselves in each other as passed-on potentials. They are the inter-given: the systematic form in which potential is relayed from one experience to another. “Objectification itself is abstraction” (Whitehead 1985, 25).
