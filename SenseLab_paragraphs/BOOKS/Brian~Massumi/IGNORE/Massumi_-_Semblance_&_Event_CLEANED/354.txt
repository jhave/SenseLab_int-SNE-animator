Susanne Langer treats forms as mundane as perspective painting in just this way. In a painting, “everything which is given at all is given to vision” (Langer 1953, 73). But we perceive more than we see. We see surface but perceptually feel depth. Thus there must be in the painting “visible substitutes for nonvisible ingredients in space experience”: “things that are normally known by touch or [the proprioceptive sense of] movement” (ibid.). This couching of nonvisible trace experiences in visible form can only be achieved if the artist “departs” from “direct imitation” (ibid.). The artist must falsify vision in just the right way to produce an effective inclusion in the visible of what cannot be seen. In other words, she must paint not the visible resemblances her eyes see in sensuous form, but rather the nonsensuous similarity between vision and other-sense events that yoke together amodally in movements through space. If painted with enough artifice, their linkage will be activated even in the actual absence of the movements and spaces to which they belong. The painting archives amodal, nonlocal linkages that operate through vision but are not contained by it.
