Cunningham disables metaphor and cuts communication. He strips dance of “all representative and emotional elements that might drive movement . . . to focus on pure movement” (Gil 2002, 121). The focus on pure movement brings dance integrally back to the “kinesthetic sense,” as taken up in vision: specifically at the vanishing point where proprioception enters into a zone of indistinction with thought. Dance kinesthetically “appeals through the eye to the mind” (Cunningham 1968, 90).
