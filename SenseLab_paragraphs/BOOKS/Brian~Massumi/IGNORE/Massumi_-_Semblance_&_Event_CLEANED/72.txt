Sometimes at the culmination of the experience, the drama appears for itself. It is seen. Not actually, if that means corresponding to a sense impression striking the body’s visual apparatus. Actually: as in in act. This appearing of the drama of an experience’s self-enjoyment in the act is the semblance. Say you catch sight of a mouse out of the corner of your eye. You don’t so much see the mouse as you feel the arc of its movement with your eyes. You feel the movement continuing out of the immediate past when it was just outside your visual field, coming in. If the movement is felt to be toward you, the feeling of the immediate past includes the immediate future of your movement taking off in the opposite direction. You don’t actually “see” the vector of the mouse’s movement, or your own. You immediately experience the dynamic unity of the event—mouse incoming, you outgoing—phasing forward in the form of a felt line of approach. This direct perception of the arc of an event gathering up its immediate past and scurrying it forward toward an immediate postrodent future is an example of a semblance. If the arc of the event is seen, it is seen nonsensuously, as an abstract line (on nonsensuous perception, Whitehead 1967a, 180–183; on abstract line, Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 9, 197, 280, 296, 496–498). It is seen as in an immediate abstraction in a specious present of fear.
