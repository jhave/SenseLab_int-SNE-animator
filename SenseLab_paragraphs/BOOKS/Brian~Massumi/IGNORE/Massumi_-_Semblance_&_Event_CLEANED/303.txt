Vitality affects give rise to forms of life that are fundamentally shared.3 The soothing, like a launching, is a unitary continuing-across: from voice to ear, hand to back, hearing to touching. It is all and only in the linkage, which is the separate province of neither infant nor parent. The emergent parent-form is in fact an amodal coming to life of the relation between parent and child, through difference-yoking repetition.
