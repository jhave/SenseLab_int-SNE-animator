When Lozano-Hemmer talks about relational “architecture,” he doesn’t mean architecture in the narrow disciplinary sense (although of course architecture may itself be practiced relationally). It’s similar to what I’m talking about here: the technical staging of aesthetic events that speculate on life, emanating a lived quality that might resonate elsewhere, to unpredictable affect and effect. Stagings that might lend themselves to analogical encounter and contagion. That might get involved in inventive accidents of history. It’s about architectures of the social and political unforeseen that enact a relation-of-nonrelation with an absolute outside, in a way that is carefully, technically limited and unbounded.
Demands made on art to display its actual political content, or to observe a certain actual form that is deemed more political, are demands to curtail this kind of speculation, and the aesthetic politics it performs. They are demands to curtail aesthetic potential. There is nothing in principle wrong with that. As I said, life’s an art of dosages, and there can be very good reasons to dope artistic potential with explicit political content.
