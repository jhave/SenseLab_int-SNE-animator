In bare point of fact, that is where everything, not just philosophy, begins. “Activity and change” are “the matter of fact” (Whitehead 1968, 146). “‘Change taking place’ is a unique content of experience” (James 1996a, 161). The unique content of experience: “the sense of activity is in the broadest and vaguest way synonymous with life. . . . To be at all is to be active. . . . We are only as we are active” (James 1996a, 161–162). To begin to think life, we must begin in the middle with an activist sense of life at no remove: in the middling immediacy of its always “going on” (James 1996a, 161).
