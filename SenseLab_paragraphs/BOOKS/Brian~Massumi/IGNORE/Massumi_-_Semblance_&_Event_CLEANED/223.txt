Tendency is a performed self-referencing to other states, past and potential. As such, it is a way in which an event in some sense, not necessarily consciously—in fact most often and in large part nonconsciously—feels itself, catches itself in the relational act. And in some sense, not yet separable from this feeling, nonsensuously thinks itself, in that very same act. This is what Whitehead calls “prehension” and what Deleuze calls “contemplation.” Both authors apply these concepts to all events, whether they occur on organic or inorganic strata. I suspect that this is where many people would part ways. To accompany this kind of thinking, you have to be open to the possibility of rethinking the world as literally made of feelings, of prehensive events. The philosophy of the event, in Whitehead’s words, is an immanent “critique of pure feeling” (Whitehead 1978, 113). The feeling is “pure” because it needs no subject—or object for that matter—outside the dynamic form of the event’s own monadic occurrence. You have to be willing to see the world in a semblance. That could be mystical. But then again, it could be a question of technique.
