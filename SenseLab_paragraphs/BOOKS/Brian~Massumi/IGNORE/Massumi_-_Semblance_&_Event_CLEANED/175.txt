The frame that the royal court gives itself is sovereignty. Since sovereignty’s order is in principle unlimited, the monarchy is always trying to actually live-up to the principle it virtually lives-in. It tries to expand its boundaries to actually include as much space as possible, to translate virtual expansiveness into actual expansion. Translated into expansionism, into an actual political dynamic, the sovereign framing turns imperialist. If the expansion is interrupted, so that sovereignty is forced to fall back within a particular territorial frame, then the god-like pretension to universal order turns totalitarian. A whole political ecology that will come to play itself out historically in a range of actually existing State formations turns out to have been virtually included in the immediately given relation-of-nonrelation absolutely centering each successive framing.
Perspective painting includes in its frame the same potential as gets played out in the absolutist empire. Nevertheless, there is nothing in the painting that makes a destiny of empire or totalitarianism. The very same dynamic can, and later did, scale down to the scale of the human body, which then appeared as what has been critiqued in political philosophy as the “legislating subject.” This is the individual as sovereign of himself, king in the castle of his own body—and pillar of bourgeois democracy, as a kind of democratic absolutism. We see continuations of this in the concept of “sacred” human rights and “inalienable” personal freedom. All of this was recognized in a way by the critique of “ocularcentrism,” which was particularly strong in the 1980s, when sovereign-individual freedoms started to be chipped away at by an emergent neoconservatism, centrally concerned with a latter-day State sovereignty of its own singular brand (Massumi 2009). Every monadic framing contains many destinies, transmonadically, if only in spite of itself.
