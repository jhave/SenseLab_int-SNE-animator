The affective nature of the new form of life that emerges prompts Stern to rename activation contours vitality affects. The world is not reducible to the recognized ability of objective form to conserve its sensuous identity in each of its serial appearings in different locations. On the contrary, that ability is the product of another power: that of “unrecognized,” nonsensuous, affective, linkages that bring “extremely diverse” nonlocal differences together qualitatively. Affect brings form qualititatively to life.
