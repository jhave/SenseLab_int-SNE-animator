If the intensity of a form of lifeâ€™s grappling with the eternal return of content constitutes its politicality, then techniques of existence that fail to grapple with it, or refuse to, are apolitical. The more political a technique of existence is, the more inventively iterative it is. It self-phrases, following a rhythm of repeated differencings with a characteristic momentum. It phases, dephases, and rephases, taking its own time, setting in as it will. It eventfully self-expresses.
