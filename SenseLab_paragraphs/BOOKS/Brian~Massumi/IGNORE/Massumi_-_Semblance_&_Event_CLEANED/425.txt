The buds of content are no less incessantly necessary than they are a constant challenge to any practice aspiring to take a technique of existence to the expressive limit of what it can do. They are constraints enabling of what a practice effectively does, approaching the limit of its expression. And approaching the expressive limit is what process never ceases to do. The limit of lived abstraction is the universal attractor of experience. It is no less than the ever-renascent terminus of the world: the perpetual point of departure for its renewal. Every technique of existence has an expressive appetite for pushing nonsensuous similarity as far as it can go, carrying it to its highest degree of abstractive intensity, making it as absolutely felt as it can experienceably be. Pushing the limit of lived abstraction is the universal “lure for feeling”: appetition (Whitehead 1978, 184–185). Lure of extra-being. Lure for becoming.
