Skipping the standardized judgment phase means that new forms of Thirdness   must   be   invented.   Only   an   intervention   of   Thirdness can regulate becoming in any way, whether normatively for stability, or self-renewably for the existential flicker of reappearing potential. Because that’s what Thirdness is: regulated passage from one phase to another. Essentially, that means “habit-taking” (Peirce 1992a, 277). But it also means “law.” Law in its “original” sense is nothing other than the regularity of habit acquired in the chaotic course of emergent experience (276). In a derivative sense, law is an imposition of habit from on high, through the mediating influence of a comparative standard or normative model. It is the challenge of any architectural process that wishes to live up to its vocation for living-in diagrammatic abstraction to invent techniques of coming to architectural existence that do not model in the traditional sense. That reinvent pliable “laws” of architectural design in the “original” sense, where the emergence of regularity “mingles” with a “lawless” element of “pure spontaneity.” In a flicker with chance. Law then returns to the “pure chance” and vague “indeterminacy” it “developed out of” from the First (276). So that it repeats the act of emergence. Evolutionary law fueled by chance. Architecture reinventing itself, as it reinvents new techniques for mingling chaos and regularity toward the determination of new architectural form.
