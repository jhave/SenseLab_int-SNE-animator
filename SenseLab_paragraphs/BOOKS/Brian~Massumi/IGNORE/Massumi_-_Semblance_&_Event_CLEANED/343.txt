The nonlocal linkage between nonlocal linkages that is at the heart of this operation was just analyzed in terms of thought and language. Ritual is a way of performing thought. It is a technique of existence for bringing forth virtual events through techniques involving bodily performance, in mutual inclusion with events of the other kinds. Events, for example, of the heavens, of a cosmological kind. Ritual resonates with virtual events, as the operation of language does. Ritual gestures forth virtual events from the horizon of thought. Language speaks or writes them. The techniques ritual employs to set the conditions for virtual events to appear involve language use of many kinds. But ritual’s ability to mobilize affective tonality in order to nonsensuously link nonsensuous linkages to each other hangs specifically on the performative use of language—language as gesture. Nonverbal gesture, however, can do the trick just as well, if the conditions for set for it.
