Whatever figures, formal identities, and even ideal standards and general models that may also be built in alongside the trigger-juncture are submitted to the flicker of intensity. They do not dominate. They do not definitively foreground themselves. “Indicators and bearers of each other,” they collaborate in the toggling. They are no longer limitations, as they are in standard, normative architecture. They are no longer constraining. They are the enabling constraints of a renewed selection. The selective renewal is of the kind that composes an “alteration of a complete spectrum” of lived experience. It brings back to life its virtual color and shadow, in all their intersensory textures. It recharges the activity of relating from which all experience emerges. Becomings continue, in a prolonged chromatics of variation. Ovum of the universe edgily re-segmented.
Not deconstruction: continued construction. Reconstruction, on the fly. Not interruption: recharging, resaturation with potential. For deconstructive strategies, architecture is a “scene of writing” (Eisenman 1999, 26–35). For reconstructive strategies, it is a platform for diagrammatic reemergence. Deconstructive strategies pointedly interrupt the event of architecture. Reconstructive strategies fluidly continue it.
