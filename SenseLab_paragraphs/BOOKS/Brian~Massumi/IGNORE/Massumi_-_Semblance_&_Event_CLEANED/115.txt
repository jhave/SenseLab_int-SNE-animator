It is only when our idea [our expectation of perceiving something] has actually terminated in  the  percept  that  we  know  “for  certain”  that  from  the  beginning it was truly cognitive of that. We were virtual knowers before we were certified to have been its actual knowers, by the percept’s retroactive validating power. (James 1996a, 68).
