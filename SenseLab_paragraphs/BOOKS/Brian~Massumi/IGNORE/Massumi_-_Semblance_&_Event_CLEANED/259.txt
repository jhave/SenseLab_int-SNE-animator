The continuity intensely continues apace with the plodding. When identity is seen, what is being seen is an anticipated next touch conjoined with an anticipated next proprioception conjoined with an anticipated second vision. The eye is functioning synesthetically to see the unseeable. To oversee touch, proprioception, and its own present, skipping over the here-now of its own formative activity, fed forward in anticipation of thereafters. An anticipated touch, proprioception, or vision is a potential touch, proprioception, or vision. The overseen is unseen potential. The unity of identity, the simplicity, of the resulting object has been limitatively extracted from the complex chaos. That chaos continues to be seen, feebly: underseen in the form of identity. The chaos must continue for the object to have something to reemerge from, as anticipated. Double vision: figurative or objective order out of iteration;  and  a  continuing  chaos  of light ever-dawning. Vision abstractly oversees order by synesthetically superadding habitâ€™s abstractions to the singular immediacy of its ever-renewing chaos.
