“Pure” as applied to “expression” means: effectively fusional. It means: that the compositional “extra” of heterogeneous elements that technically enter-in is felt unitarily in the dynamic form of an immanent force issuing as an event, in experiential excess over both the sensuous forms involved and their sense modalities. Pure expression points to no content other than this event: its own event. Fusion is another word for nonlocal linkage. Effect is another word for nonsensuous similarity. Expression is another way of saying translation of world-lines into a changing qualitative-relational order doubling the objective order.
