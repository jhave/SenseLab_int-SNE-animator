Blank slate—singular proto-figure—stable figure—object identity—ideal standard—general model. All of these are diagrams in their own right, each in its own way. Each step in the process by which potentials lift into existence, filter through, and plot into a new construction, is also a diagram according to Peirce’s just cited. In the most extended sense of the word, the entire process is its own occurrent diagram.
