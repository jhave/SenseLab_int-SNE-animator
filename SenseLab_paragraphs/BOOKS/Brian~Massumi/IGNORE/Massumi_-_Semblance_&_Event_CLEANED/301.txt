Stern discusses the ontogenetic role of amodal experience at a nonconscious level before there is a sense of self. “For instance, in trying to soothe an infant, the parent could say, ‘There, there . . . ,’ giving more stress and amplitude on the first part of the word and trailing off toward the end of the word. Alternatively, the parent could silently stroke the baby’s back or head with a stroke following the same activation contour as the ‘There, there’ sequence, applying more pressure at the onset of the stroke and lightening or trailing off toward the end. If the duration of the contoured stroke and the pauses between strokes were of the same absolute and relative durations as the vocalization-pause pattern, the infant would experience similar activation contours no matter which soothing technique was performed. The two soothings would feel the same (beyond their sensory specificity)” (Stern 1985, 58). This is the onset of a spontaneous selforganizing of experience. Instead of experiencing a spoken-word parent and a separate stroking-touch parent, the two parenting events yoke together, across their sensory, spatial, and temporal disparities, by virtue of the nonsensuous similiarity of their activation contour. There is one seamless soothing-parent. A new entity, the amodal parent-form, emerges as a function of the amodal activation contour, whose lived quality is affective (a soothing).
