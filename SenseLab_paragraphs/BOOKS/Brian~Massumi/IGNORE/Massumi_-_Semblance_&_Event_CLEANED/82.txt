If we apply this concept of the relation-of-nonrelation to what occurs between occasions of experience, we are led to treat the experiences themselves as differentials. The consequence is that occasions of experience cannot be said to actually connect to each other. They may be said to “come together” only in the sense of being mutually enveloped in a more encompassing event of change-taking-place that expresses their differential in the dynamic form of its own extra-being. That occasions of experience do not actually connect is Whitehead’s doctrine of “contemporary independence” (Whitehead 1967a, 195–196). It means that the relation between different experiences is purely effective: on the creative level of effect. Their relation is the creative playing out of a nonrelation effectively expressing the inexpungeable difference between the sheer individuality of events of experience, by virtue of which each is a little absolute.
