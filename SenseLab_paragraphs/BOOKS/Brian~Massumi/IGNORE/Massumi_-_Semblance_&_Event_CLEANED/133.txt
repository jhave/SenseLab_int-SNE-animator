Once again, we don’t see it instead of what we think of as being the actual form of the object. We’re seeing double again. But this time, we’re seeing the actual form “with and through” that set of abstract potentials. The reason we’re directly seeing an object and not just a surface is because we can’t not see what we’re seeing without also experiencing voluminousness and weightiness—the object’s invisible qualities. Seeing an object is seeing  through  to  its  qualities.  That’s  the  doubleness:  if  you’re  not qualitatively seeing what isn’t actually visible, you’re not seeing an object, you’re not seeing objectively. “Objectification itself is abstraction. . . . Abstraction expresses nature’s mode of interaction and is not merely mental” (Whitehead 1985, 25–26). Deleuze drives the point home: “the abstract is lived experience. . . . you can live nothing but the abstract” (Deleuze 1978).
Certain currents in embodied perception take this to heart. Alva Noë, for example, concludes that all visual perception is “virtual” (Noë 2004, 50, 66–67, 134–135).
