We live, as it were, upon the front edge of an advancing wave-crest, and our sense of a determinate direction in falling forward is all we cover of the future of our path. It is as if a differential quotient should be conscious and treat itself as an adequate substitute for a traced-out curve. Our experience . . . is of variations of rate and of direction, and lives in those transitions more than in the journeyâ€™s end. (James 1996a, 69)
