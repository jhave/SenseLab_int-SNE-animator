The reason they were made for each other is that sharing the same principle of order put them intensely into “resonance,” as Deleuze and Guattari would put it. They connected abstractly, in analog offset, at the virtual center where their immanence to themselves appeared. The virtual center is like a black hole. It sucks everything in, but still emanates a certain energy. For example, the vanishing point in painting takes the whole scene in. But across the variations in painted content, it can also leak something back out. Not a thing, but an abstract quality.
Landscape painting, repeated and varied, gave the perspectival spatial order an ethos. It gave the purely geometric ordering of perspective space an inhabited quality. The semblance came to be virtual home to a people. An inhabited quality is just what a realm wants, if it is going to try to unite its people and not only try to expand its territory. It’s an attractive quality for a kingdom, for reasons all its own. The imperial monarchy was predisposed to take that same quality into itself, to make it its own, to interpret it, in the sense of producing its own effective analog of it, in its own political world. As was totalitarianism, differently. And bourgeois democracy, differently again. There was no necessary causal connection in any usual sense of the word between perspective painting and the imperial monarchy. There was more an affective impetus—an autonomous “want” in the kingdom—that happened to echo with a qualitative spin-off effect of painting practice. The want was not an expression of a lack, but rather of the empire’s striving or tending to sustain and expand its world-saturation.
