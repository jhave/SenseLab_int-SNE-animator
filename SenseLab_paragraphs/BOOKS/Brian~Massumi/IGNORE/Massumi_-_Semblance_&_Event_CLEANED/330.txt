The ambulatorily-challenged professor can and does get lost in thought and the meanders of language, as we all do at times. The pragmatic-truth potential of language is sometimes weltered-out by the backgrounded crowd of virtual paths and termini coming undemonstratively to the fore. When the event falls too heavily on the speculative side of the coin, we lose the ability to follow through a particular tending-toward to its sensible terminus in stepwise attunement to selectively demonstrative senseperception. We are lost in too-open-range foretracing. We—our events’ unfoldings—are absorbed in speculation. The selectively oriented segueing from virtual foretracing to sensibly sign-posted ambulation is in suspense. Tending-toward does not sensuously terminate. Rather than ambulating, it ambles on. This is imagination: suspended ambulation. In imagination, we are speculatively absorbed in a universe of nascent actions whose terminus-tending unfolding is inhibited. We are free-range navigating the nonsensuous side of the world’s double ordering.
