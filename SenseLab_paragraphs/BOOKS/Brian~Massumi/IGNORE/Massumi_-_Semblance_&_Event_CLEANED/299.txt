Up until now in this account, there has been an implicit presupposition of an already constituted subject of experience observing objects as they encounter each other and enter into  combination.  In  a  word,  there has been a supposition of a self. But selves emerge. We are not born into “the” world. We are thrown into worlding. Amodal experience, and the qualitative universe of nonsensuous similarity it composes, are active in the constitution of the self worlding. The qualitative order plays an active role in that constitution. It participates in emergence. It plays an ontogenetic role.
