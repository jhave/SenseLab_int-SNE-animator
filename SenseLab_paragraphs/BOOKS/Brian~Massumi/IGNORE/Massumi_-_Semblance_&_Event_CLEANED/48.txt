Activist philosophy does not deny that there is a duplicity in process between subjective and objective. It accepts the reality of both. Rather than denying them, activist philosophy affirms them otherwise, reinterpreting them in terms of events and their taking-effect. Specifically, it understands them in terms of the relaying between events, in their “successive takings.” This makes the problem of the subjective and the objective fundamentally a question of time, as implicating a multiplicity of events. Grappling with the problem of the subject and object becomes a way of developing activist philosophy’s take on multiplicity and time, a concept whose centrality is implicit from the start in activist philosophy’s emphasis on change.
