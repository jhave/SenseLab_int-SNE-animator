A semblance takes the abstraction inherent to object perception and carries it to a higher power. It does this by suspending the potentials presented. Suspending the potentials makes them all the more apparent by holding them to visual form. The relays to touch and kinesthesia will not take place. These potentials can only appear and can only appear visually. The event that is the full-spectrum perception is and will remain virtual. A life dynamic is presented but virtually, as pure visual appearance.
