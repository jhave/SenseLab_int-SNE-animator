Sensation fills out the plane of composition and is filled with itself by filling itself with what it contemplates: it is ‘enjoyment’ and ‘self-enjoyment.’ It is subject, or rather an inject. Plotinus defined all things as contemplations, not only people and animals but plants, the earth, rocks. These are not Ideas we contemplate through concepts but the elements of matter that we contemplate through sensation. The plant contemplates by contracting the elements from which it originates—light, carbon, and the salts—and it fills itself with colors and odours that in each case qualify its variety, its composition: it is sensation in itself. It is as if flowers smell themselves by smelling what composes them. (Deleuze and Guattari 1994, 212; see also Deleuze 1994, 74–75)
