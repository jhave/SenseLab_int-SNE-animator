Comparison involves a Thirdness. A mediating third term is abstract in much the way a Platonic form is: ideally still, glossing over the chaos and the jitter. Except that it takes the gloss to a higher level. It raises the mediation of figures off their shared surface to a space of judgment hovering above. The standard hovers unseen in a thought-space above the surface of perception. It is a height of generality. It is a general paragon. It is ideal. As an ideal, it is not so much overseen as it is overseeing. It oversees the correctness of the assessment.
