This ambling navigating of the nonsensuous side can end up in delusion. This occurs when it is forgotten that the event unfolding is a suspension of ambulation, and premature conclusions about sensuous termini are drawn in the absence of the stepwise conditions for their demonstrative fulfillment. It is not the free-range ambling on the nonsensuous side that is delusional. What is delusional is taking the ambling for a good-enough substitute for an effective ambulation, forgetting that pure demonstration is impossible. Delusion is not a disorder of the imagination, or of thought per se. It is a defective expression of the positive power of thought-asimagination to free-range foretrace, with the meanderings of language. Delusion is in fact a disorder of the language factor involved. We are delusional when we forget that the operation of language is not essentially one of designation, that it is never purely demonstrative. We are delusional
