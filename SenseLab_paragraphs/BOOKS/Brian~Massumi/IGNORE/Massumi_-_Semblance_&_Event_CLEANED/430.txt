Whichever path is taken, the point of conversion is the transformation of vitality affect into emotion. The conversion into emotion may be explicitly noted, thereby becoming the content itself. Or it may be transitionedthrough on the road to content otherwise construed. The resonant tenor of the expressive event is doubled by what Barthes called a “supplementary message” to its sheer occurrence. The event passes from pure “uncoded” liveness (mechanically reproduced or not) to coded “message” (Barthes 1977, 19, cited in Ashby 2010, 234). It becomes communicable. The event ceases to be expressive on its own singular-generic account, to enter the general category of “communication”—a super-genre as envelopingly vague and indistinct as it is wont to take life’s intensities to be. No general category understands the first thing about affect. They are always by nature emotion-ready, because they are always ready-made for content. They have an in-bred appetite for content. They maw for it. That’s what they do. They  are  voracious  techniques  of  containment.  “Common  sense”  is promiscuously dedicated to general categories. As is “good sense,” in a more selective and disciplined way. “Opinion” invests general categories with a personalized emotional force of their own. Weapons of mass containment,  all.
