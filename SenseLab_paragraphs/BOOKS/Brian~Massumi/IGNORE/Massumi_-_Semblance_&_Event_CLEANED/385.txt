Valéry anticipates the Cunninghamian transition to contemporary dance. “Most of our voluntary movements,” he writes, “have as their end an exterior action: it is a question of reaching a place or an object, or of modifying some perception or sensation at a determinate point. . . . Once the goal is reached, once the affair terminates, our movement, which was in a certain way inscribed in the relation of our body to the object and our intention, ceases. The movement’s determination contains its extermination; it cannot be conceived or executed without the presence and collaboration of the idea of the event terminating it” (Valéry 2003a, 27).
