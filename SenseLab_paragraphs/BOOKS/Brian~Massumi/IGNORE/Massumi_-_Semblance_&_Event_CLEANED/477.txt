A form of life was defined earlier as “a complex manner of being/being able/knowing/wanting, appearing eventfully together in virtual mutual inclusion.” “Under conditions of change” is implicit in the definition. Also understood was that the “being” was its own event: a being of becoming. A technique of existence is the operator of a form of life as a mode of becoming. The events that are according to its operation, are its creatures. The operation of a technique of existence is a mode of composition. The compositional process is ontogenetic: concerning the appearing of forms of life. If politics is about the potential animating forms of life, then it is essentially bound up with the operation of techniques of existence. That its activity is compositional and ontogenetic makes it more fundamentally creative than regulative, inventive more than interpretive. The notion that the complex manner constituting a form of life appears in “virtual” mutual inclusion immediately raises the question of amodal experience and nonsensuous similarity—placing the problem of lived abstraction at the heart of the political.
