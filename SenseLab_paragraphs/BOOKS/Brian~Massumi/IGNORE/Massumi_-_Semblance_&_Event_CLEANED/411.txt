It is a commonplace of media theory to say that technologies prolong the senses. This is the least of it. The senses are in any event self-prolonging. They only ever work to detach from their objective (organic) functioning events of lived abstraction that take them places they cannot go (in thought, in language). The senses themselves are technologies of lived abstraction, doing hard fusional labor every microsecond of every day, between every living breath. Technologies are not “prostheses of the body.” The senses are already that. Technologies are abstract-event multipliers and disseminators. They are prostheses of the life of abstraction. Aliveness engines.
