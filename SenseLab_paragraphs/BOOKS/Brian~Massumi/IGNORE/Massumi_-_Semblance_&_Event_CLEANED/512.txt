event’s momentum as affordances. as reenergizations of its initial impulse as it arcs toward its self-creative terminus. But it must be remembered that it is not the “data” that are perceived in any usual sense of the term. The subjective form of the datum is perceptually felt. In other words, what is “perceived” is the form of its activity. The form of its activity strikes as interference and is taken in as resonance (see the discussion of resonance in chapter 2). The concept of resonance enables a theorization of secondary originations of an occasion on the fly without contravening the principle of the contemporary independence of actual occasions. Here, the conversion of interference into resonance involves a nonsensuous perception by the event under way of its affective co-implication with other events—an intuition of their mutual immanence in each other’s arising. In Deleuze’s reading of Leibniz, the corresponding concept to the affective capacity of resonant infolding is the vinculum (bond)—the “unlocalizable primary link that borders the absolute interior” of a monad with its outside; “a supple and adherent membrane coextensive with everything inside” that enables the event of experience to “recover the other side, not as exterior to the monad, but as the exterior or outside of its own interiority” (Deleuze 1993, 111).
