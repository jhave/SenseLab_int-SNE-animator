There is not just one kind of beautiful semblance. There are different “degrees” of beautiful semblance, of very different aesthetic and political force. The scale is “determined not by the greater or lesser degree of beauty but by the extent to which a thing has more or less the character of semblance” (Benjamin 1996c, 224, all quotes below 224–225). There is in beauty a sliding scale of semblance that moves between two poles. At one end is the apoliticality of the semblance whose beauty evokes the-truth of its content. At the other end, there is the “semblance in which nothing appears”—which is its own appearing, and whose appearing isn’t a “mere” appearance but a sui generis event.
