Abstract art returns vision kinesthetically to its own self-creative activity. Vision is remitted to the felt activity of its coming eventfully into itself: a proprioception of vision. Pure visual activity, at the absolute vanishing point where it enters a zone of indistinction with thought, from which its action is ever renascent. Pure thinking-seeing, perceptually felt. The abstract opening of vision onto thought is purely dynamic. It brooks no closure. Unspatialized, eschewing content; neither containing nor contained. “The unlimited returns” (Deleuze 1990, 7).
