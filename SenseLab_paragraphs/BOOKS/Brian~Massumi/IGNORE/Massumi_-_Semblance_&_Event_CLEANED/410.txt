The formation of technological lineages is not extraneous to techniques of existence. It does not weaken or degrade their powers of expression. The  vicissitudes  of  technology  are  immanent  to  the  continuing  self constitution of techniques of existence. Technological lineages distribute in chronological time and extensive space the natural movement of techniques of existence: expressive eventsâ€™ abstract intensity, coming to vary. Self-differing, as they always do, in any event. Technologies boost the natural dynamic of self-differing inherent to experiential dynamics. They prolong the spontaneous power incumbent in experiential events of selfdetachment, toward continuing variation.
