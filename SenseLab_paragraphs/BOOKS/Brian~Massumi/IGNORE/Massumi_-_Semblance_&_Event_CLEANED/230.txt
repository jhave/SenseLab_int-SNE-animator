The enveloping of color and illumination in one another extends through the senses, each one bearing and indicating all. Mutually enfolding. A many-dimensioned virtual whole of feeling is enfolded in every actual appearance in any given sense mode. Synesthesia. A color, smell, or touch is an emergent limitation of the synesthetic fold: its differentiation. A color, smell, or touch extinguishes the whole in its difference. And in the same stroke presents it: as the totality of its own potential variations. All the befores and afters it might be, instantaneously. The distinctness of each present perception is accompanied by a vague infinity of self-continuity. An integral synchrony of befores and afters. Unbeen, beable. Timelike, logically prior to linear time. In the limits of the present. Wholly, virtually, vaguely. Differentiallly. Edging into existence.
