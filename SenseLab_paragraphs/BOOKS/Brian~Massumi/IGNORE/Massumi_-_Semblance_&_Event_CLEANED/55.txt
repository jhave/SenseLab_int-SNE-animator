“Raw” experience carries connotations of a state of precultural grace unsullied by language. A “prelinguistic” Eden uncomplicated by learning and the “higher” cognitive functions it inculcates. This is not at all the concept here. The concept is rather that all “higher” cognitive functions come back through the middle. They are only active to the extent that they reactivate in the quasi-chaotic midst of something doing again. They come back through, bare-actively, in all immediacy, as recreative factors of experience rearising. They are “judgments” that come in all immediacy as direct perceptions. They concern, for example, causal relation, similarity, categorizations, qualitative evaluations, linguistic associations, and even symbolic figurings. Peirce calls them “perceptual judgments,” admitting that it is something of a misnomer because they occur without a separate act of judgment (Peirce 1997, 93–94, 242–247). They come, he says, “as if” there had been a judgment but too immediately for one to have actually been performed. They are judgments without the actual judgment: direct perceptions of the world’s acquired complexity, incoming, flush with the bare-active firstness of experience feeling its way into a next event. This “feedback of higher forms” back into and through pure experience is summed up in the formula practice becomes perception (Massumi 2002, 30, 189–190, 198–199, 293n17; see also Massumi 2010a on “priming”). Chapters 2 and 4 of this book deal extensively with this factor of pure experience, analyzed under the term thinking-feeling.
