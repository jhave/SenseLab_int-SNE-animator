The fuller the unity of the figure, the better actualized the figure, the more multiply and intensely the virtual edges in upon it. The more passively the figure stands out in its unity, the more actively its multiplying constituents reciprocally self-stand. The undermining insistence of the virtual is a complementary and inverse movement to the actualization of the figure. The virtual is gestalted out of the picture by the same iterative process that fractals it in ever more deeply. Double articulation between levels: of emergent proto-figural activity and its resulting figurative annulment.
