Abstract art frees the line from representation, as radically as possible. In doing so, it frees vision from the task of having to depart from realistic content, as well as freeing it to forego personification. Its lines (and contrasts, and color fields) double the sensuous surface of the canvas or paper with a sense of movement perceptually felt in vision, but not continuing “behind” anything else or “beyond” where it goes. Pure activity of vision, stirring itself, but going absolutely nowhere other than with this visual event, stalling any possibility of a pointing-toward a something or particular someone beyond its own occurrence. Vision self-detaching into its own virtual event: semblance of seeing. Semblance of a truth of vision.
