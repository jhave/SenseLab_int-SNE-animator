Any technique of existence can be de-limited (as the figural does for drawing or painting), or unlimited (as abstraction does for all of the plastic arts), in a virtual event returning its predominant sense mode or principal experiential factor to its own activity, at a point of indistinction with thought. The more unlimiting this event is—the more speculative its force—the more difficult it becomes to imagine an ambulatory conversion along invented world-lines from semblance of a truth to pragmatic truth. That translation, however, is always possible, given creative impulse of adequately open-range and powers of the false of an intensity commensurate to the purity of the virtual stirring. The more abstract and unlimited the event, the more dynamically it will stall on its own occurrence. Active cesura. Break. Brake. Translation awaits, in an inaugural stalling of eventful foretracing. The visual event expresses its coming into itself, already intensely tending, but as yet unextending toward others to come. Pure intensive expression, without person, object, or issue. Open expression, in just this event, and only of it.
