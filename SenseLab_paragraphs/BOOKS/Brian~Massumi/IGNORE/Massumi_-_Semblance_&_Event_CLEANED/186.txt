At any rate, there’s an ethics and a politics of creativity contained in Whitehead’s notion of contemporary independence that I think are important to explore. They lead in very different directions from the ethical and political orientations we’ve inherited from that other notion of autonomy native to our time, the idea of sovereign-individual freedom. That kind of autonomy seems to be presupposed not only by liberalism, but by many of the “radical” politics that interactive art often aligns itself with. The main project of the aesthetic politics I’m talking about would be to rethink autonomy in qualitatively relational terms. It would be an affective politics, more about seeding exploratory weather patterns  than  cultivating their determinate contents, the particular ideas or behaviors that will be performed.
