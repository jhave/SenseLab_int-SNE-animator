A representational technique of existence foregrounds the produced resemblance to particular effect in the kind of semblance it creates. It foregrounds the resemblance in a way that suggests that it actually stands behind the painting producing it, authorizing it, and guaranteeing its truth-likeness. A perceptual feeling is produced that the seen resemblance is the founding principle of the semblance. This glosses over the differential nature of the attunement between senses, between the sensuous and the nonsensuous, and between spatiality and movement potential, upon which the semblanceâ€™s appearance depends. The principle of resemblance privileges the sensuous forms, divorced from this background of differential attunement. The resemblance is felt to be entirely between sensuous forms. The virtually occurrent, nonsensuous qualitative-relational order is outshone by a resemblance whose production could not have occurred without it.
