Asked to define the body, William Forsythe answers: “a body is that which folds” (Forsythe 2008; Manning 2009a). A body is that which doubles back on itself in a perpetual turnover of gestures, from which a universe of bodily forms of transition self-detach, in live performance, to compose a sui generis order that nonsensuously “diagrams” the body’s potential for infinitely renewed and varied movement. Performed event of the body’s vital self-abstraction.
