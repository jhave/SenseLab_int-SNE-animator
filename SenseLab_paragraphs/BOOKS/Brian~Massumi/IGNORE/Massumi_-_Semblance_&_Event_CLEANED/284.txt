A good place to begin to find an answer is movement. The perception of the simplest movement responds in many ways to Benjamin’s criteria for nonsensuous similarity. Movement has the uncanny ability, in the words of experimental phenomenologist Albert Michotte, “to survive the removal of its object” (Michotte 1963, 138). For example, Michotte might show you a screen with a dot and a circle. The dot starts moving toward the circle. Then just before the dot is about to hit the circle, it disappears. That is what, objectively speaking, you will see. But that is not what you will feel you saw. You report “that the dot disappears while its movement continues right up to the circle, and then is lost ‘behind’ it” (Michotte 1963, 138). There would be no sensory input corresponding to that movement. The dot didn’t actually continue its path. It disappeared. Yet you would effectively perceive its movement continuing. This wouldn’t be a hallucination. A hallucination is seeing something that actually isn’t there. This is actually not-seeing something—yet directly experiencing it in vision all the same. This is a category all its own: a felt extension of vision beyond where it stops and ‘behind’ where it stays; a perceptual feeling, without the actual perception. Sight furthered, following its own momentum. To the point that it is only felt: not in perception, but as a perception.
