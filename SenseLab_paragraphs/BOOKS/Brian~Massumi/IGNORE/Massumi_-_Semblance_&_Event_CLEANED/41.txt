The duplicity with which Whitehead’s process philosophy is pivotally concerned is this constitutive doubling of the event into co-occurrent relational and qualitative dimensions. William James’s own brand of activist philosophy—“radical empiricism”—is struck by the same duplicity. The basic tenet of radical empiricism is that everything that is experienced is real in some way and that everything real is in some way experienced. If “change taking place” is really the basic matter of fact of the world, then the radical empiricist must hold that “change itself is . . . immediately experienced” (James 1996a, 48). James discusses the experience of change in terms of relation. Disjunctive relations involve an experience actively “passing out” of the initial “quasi-chaos” to take a direction of its own, “terminating” its movement in a way all its own, to its own separate effect (James 1996a, 63). Disjunction is separative transition, across a threshold of becoming. Conjunctive relation is transitional continuity of becoming (62). Conjunctive relation is how the before and after of a threshold passed mutually include each other in the same event, as “pulses” of the same change. Conjunctive and disjunctive relations both concern change. For radical empiricism, they are both real and immediately experienced.
