Now that we have seen the extent to which the “sameness” of movement-qualities is a creative production, we can appreciate that proprioception is natively inventive. It is the body’s in-born technique for the production of nonsensuous similarity. The body’s automatic abstraction method. It operates “spontaneously” under all “natural” conditions, as well as in the laboratory. If it didn’t, it is worth repeating, there would be no experience of events. There would be no experience of change or relation. Proprioception is not only abstracting. It is self-abstracting: it is by nature recessive, always already slipping away behind the other sense modes to the nonconscious limit of experience, where sensuous experience rejoins the pure activity of thought (Massumi 2002, 58–61, 168, 179–188). All techniques of existence bringing forth virtual events work with proprioception and its privileged connection with thought.
