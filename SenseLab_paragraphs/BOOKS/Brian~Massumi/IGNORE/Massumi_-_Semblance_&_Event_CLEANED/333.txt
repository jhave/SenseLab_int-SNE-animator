This signals a second-degree “meaning of truth”: the pragmatic potential to invent ways of terminating movements that were initiated nonsensuously in action-paths yet to be seen, world-lines unheard-of. This is the constructive meaning of truth: the paths leading to a sensuous termination of the movement begun in thought and language must be brought about. They must be made. Their making means that the constructive truth is no less pragmatic than truth in the first, ambulatory, sense. It is speculatively pragmatic with the emphasis squarely on the speculative: intrepidly futurefacing, far-rangingly foretracing.
