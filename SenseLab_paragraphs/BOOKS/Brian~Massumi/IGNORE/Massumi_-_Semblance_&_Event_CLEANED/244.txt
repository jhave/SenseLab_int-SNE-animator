The ovum of the universe, as been. Hatched eternal.
Look closely, and you will still almost-see the invisible edge of each constituent mark. Use your imagination. Each mark is imperceptibly bounded by a virtual line. Thus the marks never effectively intersect. There are cracks between them. Since they do not intersect, they never actually form   a   boundary.   Their   iteration   fractally   multiplies   the   cracks, intensifying edginess. The unity of the figure is actually composed of a cross-proliferation of virtual cracks. The unity is abstract, superadded as a perceptual bridge across the cracking. The super-oval resulting from the bridging in-fill is not so much seen as overseen. Look closely, and you will see the bridging, you will undersee the seething cracks.
