Irwin’s process of composing-away extra-elements in painting phased out into the surroundings. It continued into composings-with. His peculiar alterations in the vitality affects of painting launched themselves into an evolution that led them to become integrally other. The affective tonality of the undertaking was constantly under investigation at the same time as the techniques for modulating vitality affects (means of creatively imbuing the artwork with occurrent perceptual “energies”).

Irwin’s place in art history will likely be long contested (painter? sculptor? installation artist? light artist? spatial artist? gardener?).
