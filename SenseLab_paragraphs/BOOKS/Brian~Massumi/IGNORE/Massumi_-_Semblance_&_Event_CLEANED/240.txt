The imperceptibility of each mark’s virtual edge no longer presents itself, disappearing into the thick of boundaried vision. Separating more than it connects, the intervening boundary brings a palpable stillness to the figure it encloses. The immediate reciprocity of black and white has settled into a mediation of two surfaces that divided from each other but qualitatively the same—white-inside separated from white-outside. The “activity” or eventfulness of the contrast is lost, along with its immediacy. What directly strikes the eye is no longer an invisible, yet vaguely palpable, oscillation evocative of infinite potential. Rather, it is the stillness of a figure, standing out.
