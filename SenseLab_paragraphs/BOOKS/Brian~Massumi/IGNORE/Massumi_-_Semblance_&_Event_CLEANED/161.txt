V2 It’s quite a stretch to go from a decorative motif to a worldwide political movement, not to mention human fish. Some might accuse you of explanatory overkill. For one thing, all of the main examples you’ve given are visual. One orientation that is almost universally shared in new media art is a turning away from the visual in favor of the tactile or haptic. This is considered a political gesture because the visual has long been critiqued as a form of dominance under the name ocularcentrism. How does the perspective you’re advancing position itself with respect to that? How can you generalize from simple visual examples to interactive art that tries to access other dimensions of the body, against the domination of vision?
