The painting is experienced as formally “reflecting” the truth of an objective order within its frame: in its sensuous content. The frame of painting closes on the sensuous scene it contains, even as the scene reflects an abstract frame so transcendently wide open as to encompass the entirety of the objective world in its principle of order. This opening onto the world beyond the painting’s frame—the “window” on the world and its a priori order the painting makes appear—is purely formal (Panofsky 1991, 27). It is abstract in a purely formalist sense. A formal abstraction is one which produces an opening onto the whole world through reflective closure.9 The speculative-pragmatic truth that the painting is a semblance of a truth (participating in the world’s worlding), and not a reflection of the truth (of the world’s objective already-thereness), is windowed out of view. A representational semblance of a truth is one that denies that it is one. It produces a semblance of a not being a semblance. This is what is often called “realism” in art.
