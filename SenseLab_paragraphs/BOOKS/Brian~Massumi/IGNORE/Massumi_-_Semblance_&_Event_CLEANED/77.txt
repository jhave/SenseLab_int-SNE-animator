The paradox of the virtual—that it is never actual but always in some way in-act—is closely associated with the paradox of immediate selfreflection entailed by the concept of self-enjoyment discussed earlier. The semblance is the event reflecting itself, directly and immediately, in lived abstraction. There are other paradoxes to be grappled with as well. There is, for example, a paradox of relation for activist philosophy.
