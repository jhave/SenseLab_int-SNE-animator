Relations-of-nonrelation, however, in no way exclude fusion. In fact, when the fusion does occur, it can be all the more striking. The audiovisual fusion in cinema discussed in chapter 2 in relation to the work of Michel Chion arises from a disjunction between sound and vision. To use the classic example, a cut may go directly from a swinging arm to a reeling body, skipping over the blow. The visuals of the blow are replaced by the sound of fist hitting jowl. Nevertheless, most spectators will report having seen the blow. The blow was really perceptually felt in vision, in what Chion calls a “synchretic” fusion of sound and sight occurring amodally across the disjunction between visual segments, and between them and the sound track. The effect is unitary (a blow). But the unity of effect is entirely owing to the experiential differential that is its compositional principle. The compositional technique employed was nondecomposably audiovisual. It occurred in the amodal between of hearing and seeing. It could not have occurred had sound and sight not come-together just so, in just this disjunctive way (timing is everything; technique is everything). Still, the resulting strikeeffect is thought-felt in the affective tonality of vision (in a “withness” of the eyes; Whitehead 1978, 64).
