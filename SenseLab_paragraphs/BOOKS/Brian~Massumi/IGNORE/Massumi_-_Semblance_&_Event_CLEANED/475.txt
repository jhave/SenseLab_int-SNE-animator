How can it not be recognized that these aesthetic processual differences are at one and the same time political? It makes a political difference whether a process revolves around a self-returning becoming or a becoming-other. It makes a political difference, when a process reaches its terminus, whether the surroundings remain composed-away, or whether the composing-away teaches itself to go-with so that the surroundings out back in. It makes a political difference to what extent a technique of existence negotiates its relation to its own activity: whether or in what way it extends itself into the perception-of-perception. It makes a political difference how it acts speculatively, which is to say, how it navigates the speculativepragmatic duplicity of all experience.
