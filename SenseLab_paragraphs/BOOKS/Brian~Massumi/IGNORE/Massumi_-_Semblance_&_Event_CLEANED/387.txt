When gesture is deprived in this way of its terminus, its pragmatic truth potential is suspended. This makes it a purely speculative activity. Any determinate relation to an objective order or a subjective realm of personal intention that may be habitually or conventionally “inscribed” in it is exinscribed. The movement relates only to its own self-energizing event. The unlimited recurring of dance to its own event is just that: an eternal recurrence. When gesture’s determination is no sooner its extermination, making it as self-dissipating as it is self-energizing, movement enters a state of perpetual turnover onto its own rebeginning. Gesture barely just made folds over into gesture already in the making, in continuous variation.
