I said awhile back that it is no accident that perspective painting emerged at the time the absolute monarchy was taking shape. Well, it was an accident, an historical accident, even though in another way they were made for each other. You can’t say that one actually caused the other. Each has its own formation. They may have been in symbiosis for awhile and mutually reinforced each other, but that was the result of an encounter. It wasn’t a destiny. There is no reason why it should have happened. It could very well not have happened, even with all the necessary conditions in place, even with the potential readily available. That it happened was an event, an encounter, an accident. That’s precisely what makes it historical. But it was an accident that was sustained. Their entering into cooperation was an accident and an achievement. Hard work and much technique went into sustaining the encounter, into holding them together: a system of court patronage of artists, an educating of court society and the larger society, a cultivating of taste, an adaptation of architecture to house the artworks implicated in the encounter (the Louvre being the case in point), new institutions (to give another example from France, the Academy). They were not so much connected to each other as they entered into the same zone of operative proximity capable of holding them together analogically, and of giving that holding-together a function. They “quivered” together in the same transmonadic field.
