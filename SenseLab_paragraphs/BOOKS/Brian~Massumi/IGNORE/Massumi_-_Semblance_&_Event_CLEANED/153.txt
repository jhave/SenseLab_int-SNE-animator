This sundering of things is what I meant by “suspension.” It’s the opposite of “disinterestedness,” if you interpret that to mean neutrality or a subjective posture of noncommittal. The semblance is not subjective. As I tried to explain, it makes the object an object. There is no subject, apart from the singular aliveness appearing in the object’s generic wake. The subject is life. This life. “A” life, as Deleuze would say (Deleuze 2007, 384–89). So the process I’m talking about can’t ever be contained by any elitism because it always potentially exceeds, at very least on its outermost fringes, any standard of taste or coolness that a particular social grouping might succeed in imposing on it. It’s the opposite of all that. It’s intensifying. Enlivening. Potentializing.
