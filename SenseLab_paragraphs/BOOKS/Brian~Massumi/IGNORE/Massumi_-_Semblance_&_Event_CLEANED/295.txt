Michotte insists that the felt-perceptions of movement-quality continuing behind, across, and through objective encounters, of balls or cars or anything else, are not learned. They arise spontaneously. They normally go “unrecognized,” even if the objects involved are recognized. Or rather, largely because the objects are recognized. The nonsensuous appearance of the movement-quality as such, as a phenomenon sui generis, is backgrounded by the reappearance of the object’s identity. Still, felt perceptions of movement quality are operative in all circumstances. If they weren’t, there would be no continuing-across of movement. The continuity of movement that comes with nonsensuous perception would go unfelt, fragmented into the discrete forms of the plurality of objects in combination. There would be no direct causal perception, no direct perception of relation, no direct experience of change—only indirect logical association (Michotte 1963, 19–20). There would be no experience of events as such. Stern emphasizes that the activation contour, the nonlocal linkage constitutive of the event, is a direct causal perception that normally operates “outside of awareness” (Stern 1985, 52). Fundamentally, it is a nonconscious, operative “trace” (Michotte 1963, 19).
