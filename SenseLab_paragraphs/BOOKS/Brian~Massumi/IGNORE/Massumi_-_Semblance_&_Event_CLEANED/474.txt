These processual differences are far more crucial to understanding Mahlerian and Irwinian expressive events as aesthetic techniques of existence than is any conventional analysis of their formal style or art-historical approach to their ostensible content. Processual differences precede content and exceed formalism. They precede content in the nascency of the experiential event. This nascency always concerns an avidity of appetition, a lure to intensity, an activity of coming-together, before it concerns the determination of a content (if it comes to that at all). They exceed form definition in the self-floating of a nonsensuous similarity that passes, the moment it is produced, into an extra-being of continual qualitative-relational differencing.
