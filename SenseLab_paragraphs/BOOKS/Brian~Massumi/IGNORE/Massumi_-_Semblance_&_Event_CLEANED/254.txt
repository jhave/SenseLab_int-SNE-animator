The continual variation draws the proto-figural lines of the ambient array across the gaps between the rods and cones, across the nose hole, and across the blindspots. The discontinuities are giddily bridged by a continuity of movement. The bridging does not yield a unified figure or stability of ground. It yields a complex of moving lines of light continuing across invisible abysses of darkness. Proto-bridges of continuity, self-standing, over a void of vision.
