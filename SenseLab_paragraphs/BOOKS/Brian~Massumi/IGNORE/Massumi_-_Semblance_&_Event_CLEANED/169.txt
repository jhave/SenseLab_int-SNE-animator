Perspective painting makes the spatial 3D quality of experience into a purely visual  matter of  fact. In aesthetic  philosophy, in  Alois Riegl and Wilhelm Worringer, the word “haptic” doesn’t mean touch. It refers to touch as it appears virtually in vision—touch as it can only be seen. Any practice of abstraction operates on all the senses at the same time, virtualizing some in order to heighten others with the abstract force of what then doesn’t actually appear. Experience is a continuum. All its dimensions are always all there, only differently abstracted, in different actual-virtual configurations, expressing different distributions of potentials. The actual-virtual configuration itself always appears, in the form of an experiential quality or “likeness”—objectness for “natural perception,” an objective spaciness without actual objects for perspective painting, a certain animation without actual life for decorative motif, and after actual life for photography, at least of a certain kind at a certain stage of its cultural history.
V2 If a semblance can be given a function, doesn’t that contradict its “autonomy”? What you’ve just said about the political function of perspective painting, for example, seems to corroborate the critiques of vision I mentioned.
