An opposition is not a duality in the Peircean sense. Duality is the selfstanding positivity of still-active contrast, pure unmediated “pairedness”: the Secondness of a mutual Firstness springing forth from the formative chaos of vision. Either/or applies to the already-sprung: completed figures. It applies to the completed with an automatic view to a value judgment: either/or, for better or for worse. Before an assessment of value can be made, the question of whether the figures share an identity, whether they are the same or whether they are mutually exclusive, must be answered. Better or worse makes no sense applied to the same. Their identities must be assessed. The only way to assess them is to compare them to each other while comparing both against standards of identity . . . and the standard makes three.
