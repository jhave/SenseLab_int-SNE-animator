We are now speculatively-pragmatically beyond the point of no return for separating the aesthetic from the political. Political vocabulary will have to expand to deal with issues such as how qualities of movement detach from combinations of objective forms in encounter. How the movement of events continues virtually “behind” where it goes, and “beyond” where it stops. How nonlocal linkages spontaneously detach from the changing location of things. How they enter into qualitativerelational congress in a universe of their own constitutional order. How the world is governed by a double order of synchresis and concrescence playing on and off each other. How all being is integrally both: double play, double existence. This gives a whole new meaning to the term “political duplicity.”
