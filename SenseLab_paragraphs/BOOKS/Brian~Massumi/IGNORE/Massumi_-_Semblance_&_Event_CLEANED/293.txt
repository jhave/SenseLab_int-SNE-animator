The ability of a manner of movement to achieve qualitative autonomy in repetition means that the double existence perceived in every change of state extends into a double ordering of the world. On the one hand, it is possible to follow the life-paths of objects as they move visibly from one combination to another, and from one event to another. This serial, objective ordering, hinged on the visible form of the object, is what Michotte calls a “world-line” (Michotte 1963, 16–17). World-lines bring identity to difference: the object’s visible form is recognizably conserved across the series of events composing its historic route.
