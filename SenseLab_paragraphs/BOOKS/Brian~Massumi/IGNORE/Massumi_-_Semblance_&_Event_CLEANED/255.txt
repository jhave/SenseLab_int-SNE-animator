To get an emergent figure, you need to add senses other than vision. In particular, touch and proprioception, the registering of the displacements of body parts relative to each other. Say a varying complex of light-lines comes to the eye with a change in proprioception. Intersensory conjunction: the first complex of moving light-lines segues into another. With the new complex comes a feeling from an outstretched hand: intersensory conjunction. Say the two intersensory conjunctions repeat. Next, their repetition is anticipated. Habit. The anticipation is recursive, since it arises retrospectively from an iteration of already repeated line crossings and conjunctions. Habit is the actual experience of a before-after, in a continuity of present conjunction. Of course there are also smell and hearing. A panoply of before-afters merge into and emerge out of each other, bearers one of the other, folded together by habit. The folding together fuses an infinite continuum of potential crossings and conjunctions, befores and afters, into the singularity of an event of perception. A vague, unbounded virtual whole self-presents without actually appearing: abstract “ovum” of an experiential universe emergent. “When any particular kind of feeling is present, an infinitesimal continuation of all feelings differing infinitesimally from that is present.” “Development essentially involves a limitation” of that abstractly felt potential.
