Chion is pointing us in the right direction when he analyzes cinema as staging a certain kind of experiential fusion-event. For an aesthetic politics, I don’t think you can use a typology based on the media as they’ve been traditionally defined, and then mix and shake. There is philosophical work to be done, concepts to compose, and this has to be done with as much technique, even artfulness, as any other craft. The concepts needed must differentiate between lived qualities of experience as it happens. It must be capable of accounting for different kinds of technically achieved fusion and resonance events.
