when we forget that there is always, essentially, a speculative aspect to language. We are delusional when we forget the double existence of the world: the immediate abstraction ingredient to every experience, the skipping of intermediaries that is always eventfully afoot in one way or another listing our movements to one side or the other of the worldâ€™s double ordering, or terminally attuning them to each other.
To be delusional is to forget that language and thought, as they virtually go together, are creative.6 Relieved of the immediate imperative to terminate in the world sensuously, free to range as openly as words are wont to do, the thought-movements initiated by speculation in its imaginative usage are enabled to invent world-lines previously unheard-of and never before seen. These invented world-lines might, as part of some later adventure, turn out to be terminatable in sense-perception, proving themselves pragmatically true after all. In the meantime, they remain as virtual as the nascent actions they string together in thought, as free as a word.
