As art plays between the poles of interaction and relation, so do the senses. Experience is always approaching one of its limits. It is always on the way to separating them out so they can be usefully cross-connected, or fusing them together in amodal immediacy to each other. As experience approaches either limit, it automatically toggles to the other. It is all good and well for the senses to function. But if they want to potentialize, they have to fuse. Every time experience separates itself out, depolarizes itself, it has to repolarize, in order to recharge itself with potential. There is a necessary return to the fusional pole doubling every separate-sense experience, and every cross-modal connection. This eternal return of experiential fusion habitually passes unnoticed. It is nonconscious. Art, practiced as Irwin practices it, as a technique of existence dedicated to the perception of perception, can nevertheless make it felt, in effect. Or make it “seen.” It make felt the play between the relational limits of experience. By doing this, it can learn techniques for recharging itself. The reason for integrating the kinds of distinctions I’ve been making here into our thinking about art and into the making of art is to renew and intensify its potential.
