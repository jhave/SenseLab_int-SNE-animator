The qualitative dimension of the event is the how it happens, co-felt, in the immediacy of its now unfolding. How-now. The qualitative how-now of the event is the feeling it has of participating in itself. It is the feeling of its unfolding self-relation. If this “self-enjoyment” by the event of its own becoming is a form of reflection, it is not only at no remove from the event; it is an essential factor in its occurrence. It is because an event “enjoys” itself in this arcingly immediate way that it is able to follow through with itself. And it is because it follows through with itself that it qualifies as self-creative.
