I think of the work of Robert Irwin as showing a way. His work has always been concerned with staging what he himself calls the perception of perception. In the early period, he practiced abstract art that created subtle, whole-field movement from arrays of dots (Weschler 1982, 85–97). As in all his work, the effect takes time to set in, but when it does it is absolutely scintillating. It’s less an out and out activity of vision than it is an activation of it. It’s like vision vibrates with its own potential. Irwin then moved into a more sculptural practice involving disks mounted on walls but lit in a way that their three-dimensionality disappears into a semblance of surface that retains a barely perceptible but extremely powerful, inwardly activated feeling of depth (Weschler 1982, 98–109). More a depth-likeness than a depth per se. He was making the third spatial dimension rise to the surface and insist on its visuality, in a kind of becoming-painting of sculpture.
