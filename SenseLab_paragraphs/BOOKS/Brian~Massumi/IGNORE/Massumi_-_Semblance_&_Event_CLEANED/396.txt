The technique of existence to which dance is traditionally considered most nonsensuously similar is music. Langer roundly criticizes the notion that dance dances music, or even rhythm (Langer 1953, 169–171), rather than purely “dancing the dance” as Cunningham insists (Gil 2002, 125). Cunningham’s point is that for dance to take itself to the highest power, in order to express most purely the body’s animate power, it must expunge itself of extra-dance elements (by “breaking up” movement). Any use that may be made of music, language, décor, visuals, lighting effects, must fuse into the dancing of the dance, taken up in it to become an element immanent to it—just as touch becomes an element immanent to sight in the everyday experience of perceptually feeling a texture through vision. Dance, like vision, or any other technique of existence, is a relational field that is as heterogeneous in its constitution as it is all to itself in its affective tonality and force of becoming (the powers of the false it marshals). There is a generic feel to seeing, even though every sight is singular, just as much as there is a generic feel to dance, even though every performance is different.
