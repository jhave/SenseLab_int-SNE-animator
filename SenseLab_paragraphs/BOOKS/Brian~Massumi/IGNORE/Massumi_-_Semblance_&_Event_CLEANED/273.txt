A different nonstandard abstractive technique of existence might plot into a construction triggers for on-the-fly selections of potential that give pause, not primarily to interrupt and make a statement, but to invite and enable an effective variation on continuing. These would be variously determined, circumstantially, at particular junctures, in the course of the movements that come to pass through the building. In other words, the seeing/unseeing, potentially touching, always propriocepting, tirelessly kinesthesing, constantly jittered, self-emphasizing, dynamic forms of embodiment that finally enter in—the architectural “clients” and “stakeholders”—are invited to continue the diagramming process to suit themselves. They are invited to inhabit as embodied coauthors of the architectural process, prolonged. Triggers are built in that jolt the emergent proto-figural level to reappear, in abstract oscillation with other levels. The continuum of potential is now un-unseen, without becoming objectively visible. Instead:  intersensorily  felt  to  flicker  with  the  objective  forms. Rather than one or the other, continuum of potential or objective vision, it would be the stroboscopic flicker between them that would momentarily foreground itself at the trigger-juncture. Built in at strategic points would be an eventful, flickering vagueness of resurgent abstraction doubling vision. The process will have constructively brought back out the continuum of abstract potential. The presence of the full continuum of potential allows the experience to toggle between sets of potential. This is neither inversion nor subversion. It is intensification.
