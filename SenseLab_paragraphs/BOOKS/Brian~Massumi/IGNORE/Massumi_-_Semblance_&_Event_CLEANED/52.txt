Technically speaking, for activist philosophy, the end of the experience knows its beginning (James 1996a, 57). All that a selfcreating occasion of experience ultimately “knows” of the world’s activity is how it has taken up a portion of it into its own becoming. “What” this will have been exactly retains a certain indeterminacy as long as the becoming is still in process. The “what” of an experience is only fully definite at its culmination. The knower, according to James, is the end of the experience’s becoming. What it “knows” is its own beginning, retroactively. An experience determinately knows what it’s been only as it peaks— which is also the instant of its “perishing” (Whitehead 1978, 29; Whitehead 1967a, 177). The only subject there is in the completed sense is a “superject”: the “final characterization of the unity of feeling” at an experience’s peaking (Whitehead 1978, 166). The “creative advance into novelty” runs from the objective vagueness of a quasi-chaos of activity already going on, to a terminal definiteness of an experience subjectively “satisfying” its enjoyment of itself in a final fulfillment knowingly felt (on vagueness, see Whitehead 1968, 109).
