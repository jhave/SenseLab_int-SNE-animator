The snow-balling is transformative. The singularity of color struck the prepared context, yielding an unexpected result; and the context structurally struck back, capturing the result for control purposes. The “impression” was mutual. It is this mutuality of transformation that makes it possible to hold, without a hint of contradiction, that the color was produced in context and eternally “insists” on itself, in pushy independence.iv The blue belonging to the situation is both “constructed” by the context, which in large part is language-determined, and insists or persists outside linguistic determination (ex-ists). Constructed and self-standing: far from being an indictment of “reality,” as an anti-speculative “science-warrior” of the Alan Sokal variety might have it, the philosophical story I have just told suggests a human definition of it. The real is that which expresses itself in language upon forcibly breaking-and-entering from an immemorial outside. Again in James’s words, the “ultimate fact” is the certainty of a “really-next-effect” whose nature cannot entirely be foreseen: an indefinite ever “more” “fringing” every determinate context with a timeless margin of chance and newness.v Reality is not fundamentally objective. Before and after it becomes an object it is an inexhaustible reserve of surprise. The real is the snow-balling process that makes a certainty of change. To be expected: the arrival of the new, the uninvited ingress of the singular. Produced and eternal, constructed and self-standing, unaccountably old and ever-changing, captive to context and eluding it, verified and storied, sitting true and in fictive travel to a future context--sci-fi (sci-phi). The fable of the real.
