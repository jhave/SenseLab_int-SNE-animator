Research in spatial orientation has been stumbling in the same direction. Recent studies assumed the traditional cognitive model, based on “reading” visual cues embedded in the forms and configurations of objects. It was found, however, that the brain’s ability to orient increased the emptier the space. The conclusion was that humans orient more by the “shape of the space” than the visual characteristics of what’s in it.i But what is the shape of empty space? Indeterminate--except for the rhythm of movement through it, in its twistings and turnings. The studies were suggesting that the proprioceptive self-referential system--the referencing of movement to its own variations--was more dependable, more fundamental to our spatial experience, than the exo-referential visual-cue system. Self-referential orientation is called “dead-reckoning,” after the nautical term.ii It is known to be the basis of many animals’ ability to orient. It is a key element, for example, in homing pigeons’ well-known feats of navigation. Its role in human orientation has significant implications for our understanding of space because it inverts the relation of position to movement. Movement is no longer indexed to position. Rather, position emerges from movment, from a relation of movement to itself. Philosophically, this is no small shift.
