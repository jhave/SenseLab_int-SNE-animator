"Queer" politics is the politics of becoming backwardly-forward par excellence: up the ass of the angel of history. Its medium is transformative indeterminacy. Rather than primarily narrating, it performs. It is a movement in search of transducers of the present, rather than organizing itself around anticipations of regulation. Queering is a politics of situational fissure, rather than of the regulated progression of terms in extrinsic relation. Despite their stylistic differences, identity politics and queer politics would do well to stress the complementarity of their agonistic self-standings (their effective diverging-together as multiplicities) rather than their "difference" (their representational standing in one-to-one opposition or contradiction). Perhaps a supplementing symbiosis between them, as co-functioning differentiations following different rhythms in a shared field of potential, would help stave off colonized symbiosis with the State--or bloody "division" by it. It is better to hobble and stagger than to fall bleeding into the abyss. Benjamin's messianism was a point of conflictual embrace between State religion and becoming. Queer politics, emerging under the pall of AIDS, struggling against seemingly apocalyptic odds, put a twist on the messianic that it will feel for a long time to come.
