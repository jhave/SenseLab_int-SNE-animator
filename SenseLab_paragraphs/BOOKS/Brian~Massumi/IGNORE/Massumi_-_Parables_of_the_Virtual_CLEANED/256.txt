Individuals always "communicate" partially and additively. Every time a part-subject holding to one individual accesses a part-object of another individual, they compose a field of potential together. If that composite field of potential proves iterable (if it is periodic, regularized, or regulated) then it is an individual in its own right, and in some way takes body (substantially situates itself). The new body, or substantializable frame, may part-integrate the sub-bodies in a way that holds them to the shared field of potential. This is capture, which is best conceived as a symbiosis, since the composite individual does not wholly supplant the individuals composing it, but rather supplements them. The fractal scaling of collective individuation is a process of supplementation.
