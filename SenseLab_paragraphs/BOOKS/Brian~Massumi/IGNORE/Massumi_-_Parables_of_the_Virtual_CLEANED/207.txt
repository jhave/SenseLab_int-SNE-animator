An example: Michel Serres' ball. Soccer ball. Bruno Latour is well known for taking up Serre's concept of the quasi-object, introduced through the example of a ball in a sports game. Serres and Latour used it to rethink the relation between the subject and the object. More recently, Pierre Lévy has used the same example to redeploy the relation between the individual and the collectivity. What I will do follows from Lévy, and moves toward a notion of collective individuation around a catalyzing point that I will call not a quasi-object, but a part-subject.
