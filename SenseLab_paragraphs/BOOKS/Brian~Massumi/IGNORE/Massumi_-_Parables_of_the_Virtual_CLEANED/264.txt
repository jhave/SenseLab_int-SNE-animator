Sensation fills the interval without translating it into a more restrictive frame, without one ever really getting a grasp on the how and why of it. Potential, the chance of the new, is in the lapse, between probable nature and explaining culture. Which is precisely where it is accessed by sensation. Sensation, as sensation, is ungraspable. As grasped (as prehended) it is body. As the residue of becoming that eludes the grasp it correlates to "mind" (bodily escape as a positive reserve of potential: the positivity of thought as previously defined). Sensation as sensation is ungraspably between: physical and mental, instinctual and learned, reflex and strategy, natural and cultural. But it is not their mix. The mixing of bodies is the event-space: the local frame of probability. The sensation is the pure channeling of the mix into the boundless incorporeality of the global event-dimension: positive de-framing. The interval of sensation lies at the point of fractal indistinction between levels: at their "bifurcation point," to use a term from chaos theory. At their best, chaos theory and complexity theory are scientific investigations of the ineradicable transformativity of all force, its sensitivity to mixture (the Three-Body Problem) and field fluctuation, its fundamental openness, the empirical lapsing that makes room for the new.
