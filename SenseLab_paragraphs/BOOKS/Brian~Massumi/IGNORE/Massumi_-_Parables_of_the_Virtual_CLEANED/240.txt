Just as the sun appears stationary from the orbiting earth, and the earth stands still as we walk upon its surface, in every interaction the motion of one body or level will appear static to another. "Stasis" is a perceptual effect of relative motion (although not of speed per se, since there is no one-to-one correspondence between slowness and "stasis"--the earth moves through space faster than its creatures move on it). "Substance" is a general name for this stasis-effect. Regions of interaction also have particular names through which they participate in the generality of substance, as things or bodies in the normal sense. Naming culminates the hypostasis of interaction. It is for language that bodies or things are--become self-enclosed, substantial entities, discrete empirical terms that enter into relation (as opposed to being regions of relationality; as opposed to being becoming).  The being of becoming is sensation. The being of things is a being-for language, the being of becoming-for-langauge.
