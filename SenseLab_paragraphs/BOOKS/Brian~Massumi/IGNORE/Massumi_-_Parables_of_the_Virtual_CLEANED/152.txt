It was argued earlier that there was no essential difference between perception and hallucination, both being synesthetic creations. The feedback of “higher” forms and their associated functions onto the biogrammatic hypersurface expands the list. There is no fundamental difference between perception, hallucination, and cognition. It was also argued that the separation between the natural and the cultural was not experientially sustainable. In view of this, why not call the unseen out of which the biogram arcs “other people’s minds”? Not particular other people’s minds, of course. The other of them all: an other of particular mindedness from which everyone’s individuated perceptions, memories, and cognitions emerge and to which they return, in a twisting rhythm of appearance and dissolve. In other words, you construe it as a shared incipiency that is also a destiny. What is the other of mindedness? From what does all individual awareness arise and return? Simply: matter. Brain-and-body matter: rumbling sea for the rainbow of experience. The synesthetic hypersurface refracts the activity of matter, through many-dimensioned splendor into color. It is the hinge-plane not only between senses, tenses, and dimensions of space and time, but between matter and mindedness: the involuntary and the elicited.
