Simondon notes the connection between self-reflection and affect. He even extends the capacity for self-reflection to all living thingsxvi – although it is hard to see why his own analysis does not constrain him to extend it to all things (is not resonation a kind of self-reflection?). Spinoza could be read as doing this in his definition of the idea of the affection as a trace – one that is not without reverberations. More radically, he sees ideas as attaining their most adequate (most self-organized) expression not in us but in the “mind” of God. But then he defines God as Nature (understood as encompassing the human, the artificial, and the invented). Deleuze is willing to take the step of dispensing with God. One of the things that distinguishes his philosophy most sharply from that of his contemporaries is the notion that ideality is a dimension of matter (also understood as encompassing the human, the artificial, and the invented).
