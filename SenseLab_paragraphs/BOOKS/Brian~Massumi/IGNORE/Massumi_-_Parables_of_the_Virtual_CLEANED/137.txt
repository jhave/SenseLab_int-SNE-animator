An aside: If the positioned sights we plainly see always result from synesthetic interference and accord, was there really a difference in nature between the sight I positively saw that wasn’t there out my window, and the one I laboriously replaced it with? Weren’t they just two sides of the same coin: the interference side and the accord side? If every effectively placed experience is a synethetic production, it becomes difficult to maintain that there is a difference in nature between hallucination and perception. Isn’t it just a pragmatic difference, simply between cross-referenced and not cross-referenced? It would stand to reason that there would be a kind of continental drift naturally affecting proprioceptive experience patches due to their self-referential, monadic operation? Their mode of reality demands it. Isn’t getting lost, even seeing things that aren’t there, just a momentary grounding in an impractical dimension of reality? It is the encompassing reality of what we really experience in a spatial way that is the lost dimension, if we try to limit our understanding of space too narrowly to vision and the Euclidean geometry of form in configuration.
