There is a certain slippery eternity to the color’s experienced singularity. Nothing is subtracted from experience when the singularity appears asymmetrically in a given context as a standard-beholden “object” of investigation. Something is added. What has happened is that a reportable (and thus intentionally repeatable, institutionally controllable, stablizable) structural coupling has been added to a traveling autonomy (an unintended, automatic repetition). In any case, experience continues. Experience is an additive “form of transition,”iii a continual motion of intersecting process lines: a co-motion (commotion) of mutual non-exclusion. As William James puts it, experience never stops “streaming,” and its streaming “snow-balls.”
