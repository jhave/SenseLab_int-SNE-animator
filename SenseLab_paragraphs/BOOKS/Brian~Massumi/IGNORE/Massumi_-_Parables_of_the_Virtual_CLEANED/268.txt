Similarly, the cyborg and the divine de-limit the human field of potential. Understood as a field function, "humanity" is the impulsive (charged) channeling of humanoid bodies toward a collective passing-"out," or "self-overcoming" at a point of inflection enveloping a brave new world, one whose frame of orientation may very well not be the same (posthuman or superhuman destiny). The cyborg and the divine, like all poles of potential, are virtual points of inflection. Once again like all poles of potential, there is an asymmetry between them. The divine inflection, or the pole of the sacred, is a point of no-arrival. Its radical otherworldliness makes its passing "out" of this world a pure return to it (Second Coming, kalpa, cycles of regeneration in any number of cosmologies). The sacred is a virtual pole of valorization operating within the field of the human in fictional mode, as a specter of becoming (becoming under the sign of return). The divine specter is the most general of fictions--the One, or one-way principle of movement that demands acquience, seeking to encompass all particularity in its frame of value, under sublime threat of abjection. The abject or the profane is the sacred's anti-pole, the expelled point of pure arrival. The expulsion of the anti-pole only intensifies its attractive power in the field of potential. Back in the world, there is an ineluctable tendency for arrival to return. The return of arrival is when an element of the divinely inflected world takes on its own valence, in defiance of the sacred's demand for acquiescence. This involves a reorientation according to a different directional frame of reference, and channels a field of potential obeying a different polarity: a swerve or leap to a different plane of value (often figured as a "fall"). The fall is into immanence (sex and capital being the most repeatedly successful profane attractors).
