An individual's constituent periodicities enter, as a crowd, into a larger periodicities, more and less regularized and regulated patterns of expression. An individual is also additive--but through addition does not immediately change in nature. A composition of two or more individuals recapitulates the composition of part-subjects and part-objects on a larger scale. Collective individuation is fractal. Although the corporeal and incorporeal are ontologically wholly distinct dimensions, in expression they fractalize, with the incorporeal fissuring the corporeal like the splices between generative segments of a fractal figure in formation, and spacing it into continuous yet divergent scalar levels. Addition of individuals recapitulates their process on a new scale, isomorphically, or better, iso-processually (displaying a redundancy of process: phase-shifting between the incorporeal and corporeal, or figural; expression; intervallic continuity of generative movement).
