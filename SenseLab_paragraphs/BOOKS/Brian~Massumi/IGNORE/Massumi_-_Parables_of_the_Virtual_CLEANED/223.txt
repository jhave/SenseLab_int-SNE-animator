It is through stylistic free variations that an already-constituted sport evolves. The "individuality" of the style is a collective individuation: it is a "collective" individuation in its absolute dependence on an intermixing of the multiple and heterogeneous elements of the sport; and it is a collective "individuation" in the sense that it is the motor of the sport's unique evolution. A style is a germinal individuation of the sport. The single body channeling the evolutionary potential is a node of expression of a collective becoming. A body has style only in and through its role as part-object. The star is the one who most effectively melds with the collectivity, towards its becoming. That becoming is inextricably aesthetic (stylistic) and ontological (emergent) [Guattari].
