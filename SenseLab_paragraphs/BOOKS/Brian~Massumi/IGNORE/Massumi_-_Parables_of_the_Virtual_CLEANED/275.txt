If ethics is about regularization, history in the usual sense is about regulation. There are in fact at least two ways in which historiography, history as linearizing writing-effect, does indeed regulate the future, without most people even having to listen. One way is through governmental policy tie-ins. These are usually funneled through neighboring disciplines, such as economics, social psychology, sociology, and a significant newcomer, "cultural policy studies" [Bennett]. The other is by becoming part of an oral tradition of certain kinds of contestatory collective individuations (for example, the self-narrating promoted by formations practicing "identity politics" in  the event-spaces of ethnicity and gender). In both cases, history is a regulatory self-expression of the Static. In the case of the two event-spaces of identity politics, the Static takes the form of a proto-State or State-like formation, respectively.
