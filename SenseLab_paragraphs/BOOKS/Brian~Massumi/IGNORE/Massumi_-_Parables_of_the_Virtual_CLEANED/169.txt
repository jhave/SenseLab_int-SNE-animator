The two systems virtually co-subsist and actually co-function. Normally, the relational continuum actually appears only in its modulatory effects. It is backgrounded or peripheralized by forms and configurations taking center stage, cross-referenced-out by their attention-grabbing extraction. But it is insistent. It always finds a way to re-enter the scene. It appears, for example, in the settled cloud of sawdust covering the floor of the circus ring, swarming but ignored beneath the stand-out movements of the featured performers. And in “peripheral vision,” the kinesthetic-proprioceptive commotion ringing every determined act of viewing with a barely-noticed synesthetic color-and-light show. Or as a white wall that a synesthetic object accidentally blends back into.
