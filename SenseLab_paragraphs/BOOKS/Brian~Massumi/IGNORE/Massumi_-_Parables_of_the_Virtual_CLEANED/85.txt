Reagan could not recognize himself in the rushes of King’s Row. In the screening room, he misrecognized himself as his new ideal. He looked back into the mirror, even as he was marked for ever by movement-vision. He saw himself as other without other that is the body without an image, then blinked and saw himself again as self-in-other, in a mirror image of his own future. His subsequent career would be characterized by a continual flicker between these two visions.
Reagan was a bad actor. This was not an accident. It was the accident, the accident of his career, his fate, his professional cripple­dom. If he had been a good actor, he would not have had to turn to politics in a quest to complete himself. He would have found passion in each new movie. Repetition of that rush would have been enough. He was a real actor only once. He became a politician for life. It is not that there is anything to prevent a good actor from going into politics. But it would be experi­enced as a career choice, not a compulsion. And the kind of political success a good actor could have would be very different, and undoubtedly lesser, than the success Reagan had. As a politician, Reagan did not stop acting, despite his tendency in his first autobiography to portray the two roles as mutually exclusive. He went about completing himself as a political actor.
