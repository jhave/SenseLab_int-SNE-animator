It is not the present that moves from the past to the future. It is the future-past that continually moves through the present. How could it be otherwise? If the body were all and only in the here-and-now, unlooped by dopplerings, it would be cut off from it’s “was”s, not to mention its “would have been”s and “may yet be”s. How could a body develop habits and skills? Are these not pastnesses primed in the present for future? How could a body remember? To remember something we have forgotten, must we not somehow return to the pastness in which it lies dormant, in order to pull out its thread of presence of again? Most all all, how could a body change? Where would it find change, if it did not have the resources for it already within itself?
