History is the fiction of a linear progression of the relationship between substantial terms. This fiction is always retrospective. As a discipline, history has never had predictive power, and never will. The present that is narrated as anticipating a future outcome is, conveniently, a past present whose future has already come, and therefore no longer has the force to fight its written containment. A "discipline" is exactly what history is. It is a disciplinary forgetting of becoming and evolution/genealogy that retrospectively legitimates containment subsequent to the writing by authorizing the general principle that particular presents anticipate particular futures according to an inexorable logic of progression. The medium of history is not the collective change it narrates on the level of its semantic content. Its medium is anticipation in the imperative mode. The imperative--application in time, futurity as containment. History concerns the past of the future. The general principle of progession all too easily carries over the narrative content to become a general model. Implicit, or even explicit, in fictions of linear progression from remote past-presents to remote past-futures is a prescriptive model for the future of the immediate past. The "present" figures exactly as that, as an immediate past of the writing presented for reasons of extrapolation into the next step in the progression. When this "present" is explicitly evoked, it is habitually in a way that depicts the present using the same generic conventions as used for the past, and often in a way that somewhat grandiosely attributes the writing the power to regulate the future of that the passing present ("if only" people would listen to the words of the historically wise ...). The future-imperative mode of disciplinary history is what gives Foucault's call for a history of the present its radicality.
