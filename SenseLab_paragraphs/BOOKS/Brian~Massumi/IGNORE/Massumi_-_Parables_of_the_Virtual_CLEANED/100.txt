This pushiness is what Hume called the “vivacity” of an “impression.” It attests to a self-activity of experience. When color is interrogated by language, it displays a self-insistent dynamism that commands itself to the instituted context, into which it breaks and enters, delivering itself to the questioning. This self-delivery or ingressive activity of experience is neither a common property of the language acts that end up expressing it, nor the sole property of any of the language-users involved. The excess of color slips into language between the experimenter and the subject. It belongs to their joint situation. More precisely, it enters their situation. It is an impersonality of experience that makes social ingress. It becomes personal, when the subject is confronted by another with evidence of his exceptional miss and has to own up to it. The color experience is not fundamentally personal. It is more accurate to say that it becomes personalized, and that it does so only in the playing out of a very particular situation enveloping a social asymmetry: the differential in status and power between the roles of the experimenter and the subject. Experience becomes personal socially. This is attested to by the fact that its pushiness, as personalized, is struck by the social asymmetry. The produced excess is personally owned up to only by the “subject.” The experimenter keeps a distance on its owning. He cleaves to the neutralizing, standardizing operation of language as reportage. For him, the excess appears as an “object” of experience, however unexpected. The “subjectivity” of the experimentee emerges in co-functioning with “objectivity,” maintained against surprise, at a different pole of the same asymmetry. The emergence of the subjective, in this personal sense, and the maintenance of the objective are co-results of the same event.
