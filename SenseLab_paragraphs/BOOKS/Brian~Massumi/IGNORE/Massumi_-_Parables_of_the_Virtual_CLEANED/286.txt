The primary point here is the conversion is of the nature of a pure event, a pure becoming, an incorporeal transformation effected in language: a performative sowing of a now potentialized virtual object as an evolutionary-historical seed of a nation [Deleuze and Guattari CITE]. The collective name that is performed is an inductive sign that catalyzes the event of its own embodiment (is emergently self-transducing).
	Now look at the compass again. Think "East" and "West."
