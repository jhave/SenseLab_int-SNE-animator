Complementarity is not completeness. The completeness Reagan yearns for is to be found in a way of appearing that goes beyond text and visualization, script and picture, beyond the dual structuring of specular identity in which one compensates for a lack in the other. He invokes a kind of vision that grasps exactly and exclusively what mirror-vision misses – the movement, only the movement (“walking, standing, moving normally through a room”). Reagan wants to see the lack in specular identity, and in the process transform it into a peculiar kind of fullness. The movement-vision he looks to is also perspectival (“from behind, from the side”). But its perspectives lie on the far side of a maximum distance, one that can be crossed but not bridged. Occupying one of these perspectives would render Reagan instantly unrecognizable to himself. In that instant, he would have become other, in a way unassimi­lable to reflective identity. Mirror-vision and movement-vision are discontinuous; between them there is no mediation. The first is relative (ongoing reciprocal determi­nation of I-me/I-you), the second is absolute (self-distancing).
