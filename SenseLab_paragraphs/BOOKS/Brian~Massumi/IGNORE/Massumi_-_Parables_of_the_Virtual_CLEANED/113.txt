But there is more to the object than attributes and contents. There was the Sinatra dimension: ole too-blue eyes. This was the axis of escape, along which the differential object “blue” slipped quietly away from its own growing objectivity. The “too” of the blue was an excess in the situation marking the certainty that the line of experiential self-activity or impersonal subjectivity that has made ingress into the situation and is traveling through it will overspill it, going on to enter other situations, across other thresholds of indeterminacy. The excess was a reserve of recurrence in the situation, vaguely palpable but not definable or confinable. It was the direct presence, in the collective experience, of a “more” of experience: the presence of process.
