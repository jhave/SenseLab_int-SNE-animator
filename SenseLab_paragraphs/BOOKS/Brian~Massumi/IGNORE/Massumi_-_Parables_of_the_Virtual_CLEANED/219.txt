It is only apparently that the players relate to each other empirically as discrete terms, mediated by reflection and language. They relate to each other in their collective becoming, as a distinct ontological level doubling their substantial being. It is this collective becoming that is the condition of a formation like a sport, common to the proto-game, the official game, unofficial versions coexisting with it, and subsequent variations of them all. Although inseparable from the empirical elements of whose contingent mixing it is an effect, the field of immanence is super-empirical--in excess over the substantiality of already-constituted terms. As a dimension of becoming gathering proto-, present, and post-, it is also transhistorical--uncontainable in the closure of any particular historical moment. It is super-empirical and transhistorical without being foundational. For it is the contingent effect of that which it conditions. This is a logical circularity, but it is not a vicious one, because it is also an ontological circuit around an opening: a phase shift between the substantial and the potential without which the movement would be simple repetition of pre-given terms entering pre-authorized, pre-meant relations. The circuit is between the substantial--or more broadly the actual (including the already-constituted abstractions of meaning)--and the potential. The phase-shift of the substantial to the potential is the opening through which empirical contingency--the intermixing of already-constituted bodies, things, and signs--expresses itself as coordinated becoming. This expression is the effective condition of collective change (open-ended belonging).
