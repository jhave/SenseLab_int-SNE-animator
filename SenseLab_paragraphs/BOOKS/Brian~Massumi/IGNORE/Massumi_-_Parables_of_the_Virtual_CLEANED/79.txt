Call proprioception and viscerality taken together – as two comple­mentary dimensions of the “medium”-depth perception most dir­ectly implicated in the body’s registration of the in-betweenness of the incorporeal event – mesoper­cep­tion. Mesoperception is the synesthetic sensibility: it is the medium where input from all five senses meet, across sub-sensate excitation, and become flesh together, tense and quivering. Mesoper­ceptive flesh functions as a corporeal transformer where one sense shades into another over the failure of each, their input translated into movement and affect.xvi Mesoperception can be called sensation for short.
