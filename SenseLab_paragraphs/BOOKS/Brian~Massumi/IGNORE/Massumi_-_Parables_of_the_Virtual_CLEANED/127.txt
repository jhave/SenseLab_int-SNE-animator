Thinking about it, I realized that I could make my way to and from my office to the exit without error, but if I had been asked to sketch scenes from the corridors or map the route I couldnâ€™t have done it with any accuracy. I had precious little memory of the way--yet I navigated it flawlessly. Correction: I had precious little visual memory of the way. I must have been navigating on autopilot using some form of basically nonvisual memory. If I put myself mentally through the paces of exiting, instead of seeing passing scenes I felt twists and turns coming one after the other with variable speed. I was going on a bodily memory of of my movements, one of contorsion and rhythm rather than visible form. There is in fact a sixth sense directly attuned to the movement of the body: proprioception. It  involves specialized sensors in the muscles and joints. Proprioception is a self-referential sense, in that what it most directly registers are displacements of the parts of the body relative to each other. Vision is an exo-referential sense, registering distances from the eye.
