This is not to say that it is not useful to speak in general terms. It is useful and necessary, in that substantialization gives becoming a being-for-language without which it would culminate in its own corporeal vacuum. Becoming with no thing, nothing to convert, nothing to phase into and out of, would short-circuit. Pure becoming cannot be. Theoretical writing, even the most becoming, must retain its general-particular function as a condition of its transformativity. Writing that is all singular, as some "experimental" fiction is, is also entirely unreadable. Which is a sensation in its own right. But it is not a theorizable one (for better or for worse). It is so self-standing that it cannot unfurl from itself enough to prehend. Rather than circuiting, it swirls, inconceivably quickly, in a void of its own making. "Experimental" writing is a practice of the aesthetic taken to its extreme, where the reading of the writing becomes a rupture ("defamiliarization") rather than either a blockage or an interval of continuation (re-circuiting). This unreading of writing is as close writing comes to being a pure sensation, to being its own event. In any case, the retention of the general-particular at issue here (some semblance of conceptual "characters" [Deleuze and Guattari] and "plot") is not the same retention as was criticized earlier in relation to theories of subjectivity-as-performance. It is not at all the same to retain the general as an opposed term and to retain it as material phase-shift. Between these retentions lies all the difference between idealism-in-spite-of-itself and incorporeal materialism [see Pheng Cheah's review of Judith Butler; the phrase "incorporeal materialism" is an invention of Foucault's].
