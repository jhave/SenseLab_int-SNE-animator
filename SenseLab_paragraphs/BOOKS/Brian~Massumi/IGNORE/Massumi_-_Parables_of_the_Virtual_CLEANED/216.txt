It would be a mistake to equate the reflex with the purely physical. Perception is never only impression. It is already composite. Studding each impression are shards of intentions and conscious memories, most presently bearing on pre-game strategy--shimmers of reflection and language. These do not frame the perception, so much as they enter its field, partialized by the separation of the sensory channels in-gathering the impressions they ride. Sharded elements re-mix to shared effect. Toward that effect, in that sensation, a heterogeneity of levels contract into the body, from which they reissue in an action--in a unity of movement through which their multiplicity is singularly expressed. The physicality of the reflex is the shared passage through the body of a disparateness of elements and levels. The "rather than" reflective of the reflexive does not mark an exclusion or opposition, so much as a conversion. The reflex action is the differentiation of human actuality, including elements of reflection and language, re-channeled through the body. The body figures not as an object, one substantial element among others, but as a part-object, a conversion channel, a transducer--of the substantial elements of mixture, along with the shards of already-abstracted elements they carry, into sensed potential.
