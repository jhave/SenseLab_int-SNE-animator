The plain old everyday self is an actor playing an ordinary role in the ordinary way. Reagan  defines that as mirror-like. Mirror-vision is by definition partial. There is a single axis of sight. You see yourself from one angle at a time, and never effectively in movement. If you keep your head motion­less and your eyes level, you can see parts of yourself move, for example your arms, from one perspec­tive. You can change perspective by immobiliz­ing your body and moving your head. But if you try to move your body and your head together in an attempt to catch yourself in motion, you only succeed in jumping from one frozen pose to another. The move­ment between is a blur, barely glimpsed. You can never see yourself “moving normally” as another sees you. Either you see move­ment, but the movement is partial, riveted to a stationary visual axis, stiffened by the effort of maintaining that line of vision, made wooden, deadened, turned into a caricature of itself; or you make a live move­ment at the price of losing sight of yourself for the duration. Every time you really see yourself, well, there you are. The single axis of vision stretches you between two surfaces recapitu­lating the same. On that axis, you resemble yourself perfectly. Stilted, static, a perfect picture. Change is excluded. Change is movement. It is rendered invisible.
