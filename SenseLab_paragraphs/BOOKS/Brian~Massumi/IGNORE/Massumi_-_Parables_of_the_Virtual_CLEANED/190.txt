When you place a brick against a brick, you are not rubbing hard matter up against hard matter. The electrons and nuclear particles making up the molecular aggregates are separated by voids many orders of magnitudes larger than they are. A brick is as sparse as a little universe. Nothing actually touches. The brick’s “surface” is pitted by emptiness. Nor is there anything solid within each atom. Subatomic innards are a quantum soup of intense, virtual events, some occurring faster than the speed of light (quantum tunneling), some enjoying experimentally verified recursive causality (complementarity). The effective stability of the brick emerges from the interrelation of those intensive, incorporeal movements. The quality of hardness is a surface-effect defined by what the holding-together of the brick’s fused elementary constituents lets pass, capture, or block. It is a regulated regime of movement. The “surface” itself is nothing other than this relational effect of hardness, or regime of passage. The effect is relative to the nature of the movement that comes to pass, its scale, and speed (a gamma ray would neither find it hard nor treat it as a surface to bounce off).
