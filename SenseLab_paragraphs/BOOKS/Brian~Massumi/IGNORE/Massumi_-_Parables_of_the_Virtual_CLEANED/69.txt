The reason Reagan gives for his determination to complete his transfor­mation is he felt like “a shut-in invalid, nursed by publicity. I have always liked space,” he writes, “the feeling of freedom, a broad range of friends, and variety (not excluding the publication [of the same name])”  (6). Again, it is not the fakeness of acting, nor the media hype, that he is objecting to. Hollywood is simply not big enough for him. He needs more space, more friends and observers, a greater variety of relative perspec­tives through which to circulate as he repeats his lines. Politics will allow him to multiply incalculably the contexts through which he drags his founding event of reality-producing acted amputation, extending the trajectory of its trace, widening the space it colours. If accompanied by adequate artifice, this will allow Reagan to enter innumerable bodies of other “fellows.” These bodies, in their eagerness (or at least willingness) to play their social roles, will have worked themselves into a state of height­ened receptivity, a kind of panicked passivity marked by auto­nomic repetition of assigned lines and a susceptibility to becoming-other, on cue. All the world will be a stage, with Reagan in the leading role, as carrier of a dehumanizing contagion.
