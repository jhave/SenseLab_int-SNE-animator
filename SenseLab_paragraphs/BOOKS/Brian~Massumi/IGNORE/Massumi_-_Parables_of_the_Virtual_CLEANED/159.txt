To simplify matters, he would sometimes use a familiar scene as a template for a new biogrammatic geography. For example, he might take his bedroom and store synesthetic objects under the bed, and in the closet and in all the drawers and corners. Whether based on a found geography like his bedroom or was entirely constructed, a biogram is a previously experienced vector-space. When S. faced one of his biograms, he was facing his own previous presence. This could be troublesome. At one point he describes going back to a certain field to retrieve a memory and being thrown off by seeing himself there on his previous visit.xiv That could be very disorienting: seeing doubles of yourself remembering every memory, in potentially infinite regress. Luckily, most synesthetes, much less “normal” perceivers, find ways of blocking out the regress. (Isn’t what we call “cognition” a simplification of the regress of reaccess into a plainly available present “reflection”?)
