Now what becomes of the "social" and the "cultural" in all this? The uselessness of the terms has compounded. As generally employed, they are words for the ties that bind. The collective bond. Belonging. But an analysis of belonging in terms of relationality--rather than in terms of terms--ends up in a very different dimension than either the "social" or the "cultural" (assuming it is even meaningful to make a distinction between them). Belonging, in capital, is a pseudo-exo-referentiality indexed to the indeterminate. The ties that bind are of "whatever" nature [Agamben]. They cannot be qualified as ties or as binding (witness the epidemic of "anti-social" behavior perfusing capitalist sociality). They have no assignable qualities. This means, among other things, that belonging, at its most expansive, is no longer clearly distinguishable from the capital, nor capital from the communicational. Is the "bond" socio-economic or communicational-cultural? In either case, it is unbalanced by a split. Where is it? If "society" is against the State, in Pierre Clastres' words, then why is it also within it (in the mini-"societies" or local "cultures" of specific bureaucracies)? If the "cultural" is "resistance" (in the usual sense), as much of Cultural Studies maintains, then what contains it? The world is not in a condition of permanent revolution. Resistance is undeniably contained, but it is not the State that contains it, because "culture" obviously extends beyond the State's dedicated spaces (into the home and stadiums), and State regulation operates precisely by applying itself to spaces as if from outside (from an included general perspective). Capital certainly can't contain the "cultural." As a limit of immanence, capital cannot even contain itself (which is why it is relentlessly expansionist, if no longer imperialist in the nineteenth-century sense).
