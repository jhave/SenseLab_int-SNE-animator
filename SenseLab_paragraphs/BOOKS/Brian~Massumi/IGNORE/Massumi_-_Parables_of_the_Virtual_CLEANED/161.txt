It is often argued that architecture should allude to history. How pale that ambition seems faced with the twisted intensity of the biogram. If architecture were to make its mission to build in biograms, rather than contenting itself with all-too-cognitive “citations,” it will have outgrown its moniker as a “spatial art.” It would have become not just metaphorically historical, but a literal technology of time. It would be as directly an art of time as of space, concerned with eliciting their continuous looping into and out of each other, in mutual reaccess and renewal.
The Argument from Recursion. The time-loop of experience has been experimentally verified, to the continuing chagrin of cognitive theory. In famous studies in the 1970s, Benjamin Libet demonstrated that there is a half-second delay between the onset of brain activity and conscious awareness of the event.xv Cognitive scientists and theorists of consciousness have worried over this because in brain terms, a half-second is a very long time. This is a long incipiency of mindedness in brain matter. All kinds of things might be going on in autopilot as perception and reflection are taking off from chemical and electrical movements of matter. Thought lags behind itself. It can never catch up with its own beginnings. The half-second of thought-forming is forever lost in darkness. All awareness emerges from a nonconscious thought-o-genic lapse indistinguishable from movements of matter.
