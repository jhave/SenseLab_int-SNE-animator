The biogram is a perceptual reliving: a folding back of experience on itself. Each biogram, therefore, is a topological superposition of a potentially infinite series of self-repetitions. A biogram doubles back on itself in such a way as to hold all of its potential variations on itself in itself: in its own cumulatively open, self-referential event. Synesthetic experience becomes monadic in the vicinity of a biogram. Facing a biogram, we are looking forward to our own past and looking past into the future. Experiential vector-space time-loops. Each new present, each event-perception, is a differential repetition of that spatiotemporal loop-the-loop: different if only by virtue of being an “again.”
