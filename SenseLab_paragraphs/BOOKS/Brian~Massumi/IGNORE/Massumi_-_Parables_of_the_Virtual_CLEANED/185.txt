Whatever the final answers--if they are ever arrived at--odds are that the descriptions of upper and lower limits of material existence wonâ€™t be based on a Euclidean geometry or linear notion of time. The universe is not just a bigger box. It could well be one giant Libet-lag: not the box to end all boxes, but the monad to outloop all monads. (Is our every Libetian awareness then a modest echo of a cosmic dynamism?)
