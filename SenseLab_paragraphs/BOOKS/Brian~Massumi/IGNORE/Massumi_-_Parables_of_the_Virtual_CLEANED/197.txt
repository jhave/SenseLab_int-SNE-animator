This is not to say that there is one topological figure, or even a specific formal non-Euclidean geometry, that corresponds to the body’s space-time of experience or some general “shape” of existence. Topologies, like Euclidean geometry, are modeling tools. Each echos an aspect of the world’s dynamism (and share of stability). Each repeats, on screen or in thought, an intensive mode of movement that is really of this world. Each is capable of bringing to formal expression certain dimensions of the infinitely twisted life of the body and the cosmos. No one model can lay claim to a final “reflection” of or “correspondence” to reality. It is simply not about reflection or correspondence. It is about participation. Differential participation. In what way does a given geometry’s effective resonance with intensive movements in the world allow us to extend them, in our orientations, memories, and brain-lagged awarenesses, toward their (and our) creative variation? How can geometry make a qualitative difference in the world?
