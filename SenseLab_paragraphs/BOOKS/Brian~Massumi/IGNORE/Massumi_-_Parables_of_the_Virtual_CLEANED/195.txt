To build topologically would be to accept that the body’s ultimate innards are as effectively incorporeal, as really abstract, as the atom’s. The body’s innards are not just the stomach and intestines. More vitally than food, a life feeds on habits, memories, and tropisms. The living body’s “ultimate” innards are the proprioceptive habits on a level with muscle fiber. They are the micro-social skills on a level with a single visual neuron. They are enculturated memories lying at the cross-roads of sense channels coursing through the flesh. They are the pattern of preferential headings hinging on all of the above, which we somewhat grandly call our “personality.” The body is these virtual innards’ holding-together, as they fold out, recursive-durationally, in the loopy present, in determinate form and configuration, always provisional because always in becoming.
