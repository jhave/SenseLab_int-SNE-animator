Katz’s color-singularity appears in and to the context structurally stabilized as an object of discourse susceptible to subsequent verification by fine-tuning the experimentation. It is in the same stroke that singularity enters discourse and is structurally stabilized as a proto- or semi-scientific object. The object has a life cylce. It passes from the “ultimate fact” of its unexpected arrival to the status of a “factoid” that is felt to be, and can be meaningfully discussed, but requires further investigation to determine precisely what manner of object it is and what can be done with it. In certain contexts, such as Katz’s, the factoid has a distinct calling to mature into a verified “bare” fact. The life cycle of the object is from active indeterminacy, to vague determination, to useful definition (tending toward the ideal limit of full determination). What we call common sense is the field of the factoid. Anecdote is its characteristic content as a genre of thought. Not all objects complete their life cycle, passing from the status of factoid to bare fact. However, all bare facts are born factoid. Science is not an enclosure. The specialized procedures and discourses of science are constrained by work-a-day circumstance to continually remix with common sense and anecdote, operating inside and outside the laboratory, passing freely across its walls. The maturing object of science emerges from this “mangle” of practice.
