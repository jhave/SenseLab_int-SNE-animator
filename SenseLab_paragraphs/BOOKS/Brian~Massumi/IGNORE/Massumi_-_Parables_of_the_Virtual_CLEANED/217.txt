Potential sensed, the player plays its field directly. Potential is the space of play. Or would be, were it a space. It is a modification of a space. The space is the literal field, the ground between the goals. Any and every movement of a player or the ball in that space modifies the distribution of potential movement over it. Each such modification is an event. The play is the event-dimension doubling the empirical event-space in which the the substantial terms in play physically intermix. The dimension of the event is above the ground, between the goals, between the players, and around the ball on all sides. It is that through which the substantial elements interrelate and effect global transformations. It is nothing without them. They are inert and disconnected without it, a collection of mere things, no less isolated for the shards of reflection and language they ferry. It is the event-dimension of potential--not the system of language and the operations of reflection it enables--that is the effective dimension of the interrelating of elements, of their  belonging to each other. That belonging is a dynamic corporeal "abstraction": the "drawing off" (transductive conversion) of the corporeal into its dynamism (=the event). Belonging is unmediated, and under way, never already-constituted. It is the openness of bodies to each other and to what they are not--the incorporeality of the event. In direct channeling. That is, in a directional channeling: ontological vector. The transductive conversion is an ontological vector that in-gathers a heterogeneity of substantial elements, along with the already-constituted abstractions of language (=meaning), and delivers them together to change.
