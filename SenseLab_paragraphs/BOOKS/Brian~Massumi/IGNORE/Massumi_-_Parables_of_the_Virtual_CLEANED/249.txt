A body is a conditional support for the incorporeality of associated events: an event-space. But at this point, what justifies retaining the trope of a supporting ground or foundation? The coming-together is asymmetrical, constitutively unbalanced. "Self-standing" does not primarily pertain to gravitational inertia and counter-gravitational balancing, although it does not contravene gravity (any more than a boat does). The self-standing of the body as an event-space is neither a direct postural response to gravity nor an anti-gravitational ascent out of its orbit. It is a float: a movement that runs transverse to the vector of gravity, by virtue of an intervening fluid medium. Sensation is that intervening, that interval. It is the sea or atmosphere within which body-channeled events transpire. Sensation is the dynamic between of bodies that is also between each body and its tendencies to inertial-equilibrium (regularization of periodic expression taken to the extreme). Bernard Cache suggests a better term than "support": frame. The term suggested itself at the outset, in connection with the game. Now that it is clear what a frame is (a mutual prehension selective of a self-standing field of potential) and what it is not (a spatial boundedness), it is time for it to return and displace the "ground." Frame is most serviceable, as long as it is remembered that for Cache the best model for the frame is neither the window nor the picture frame, but the kite [Cache: 109].
