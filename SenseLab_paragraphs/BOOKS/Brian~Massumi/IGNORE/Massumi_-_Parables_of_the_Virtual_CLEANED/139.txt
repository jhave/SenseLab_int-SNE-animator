Doesn’t this sound familiar? Doesn’t the proprioceptive experience-patch sound an awful lot like a topological figure in the flesh? Doesn’t the way it all shapes up sound a lot like the way Greg Lynn describes computer-assisted design--starting with differential parameters that automatically combine to govern unities/continuities of self-varying movement, ending only when the program stops running, leaving a Euclidean form as a static witness to its arrested dynamism?iii Doesn’t topological design method digitally repeat what our bodies do noncomputationally as we make our way to and from our work stations? Then when we watch the program run, aren’t we doing it again, slumped before the screen, relatively immobilized? Are we not still repeating our body’s ability to extract form from movement?
