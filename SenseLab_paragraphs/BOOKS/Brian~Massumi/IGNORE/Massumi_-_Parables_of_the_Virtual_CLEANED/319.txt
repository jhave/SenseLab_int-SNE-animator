3. Operation: reconnection
Medium: the sensible concept as extension
Mode: possibilization
The body is no longer suspended. The door opens. The audience is let in. There are signs that the transductive expression wants to follow through into an actual invention, a transformative unfolding of potential into new need and utility. This phase corresponds to the prosthetic projects, like the bug goggles, the Third Hand, and the more recent Exoskeleton.58 The body’s potential is reconnected to objects that promise to be useful, but in fact are not (or not yet). Possibility is just beginning to array itself before the body. The notion of prosthesis, once again, can be misleading. If it is construed as an object attachment to an organism, then the body is being treated as something already defined, as operating within a pre-established realm of possiblity. In that case, its extension is limited to its prior definition: more of the same. If the extension is taken beyond the earth’s orbit, then it is not a question of evolution but of colonization: the neo-imperialism of space as the last human “frontier.” But if it is remembered that the body-organism and its objects (and even matter) are mutual prostheses, then what is being extended is that reciprocal action. The extension, whether off-world or not, is no longer a colonization but a symbiosis. The body is opening itself to qualitative change, a modification of its very definition, by reopening its relation to things.
