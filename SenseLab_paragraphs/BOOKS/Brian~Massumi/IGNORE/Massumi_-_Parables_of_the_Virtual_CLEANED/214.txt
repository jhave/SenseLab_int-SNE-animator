If the ball is a part-subject, each player is its part-object. The ball does not address the player as a whole. It addresses the player's eyes, and ears and touch, through separate sensory channels. These separate sensory impressions are synthesized, not into a subjective whole, but into a state of intensive readiness for reflex response: they are synthesized into an actionability. The response is expressed through a particular body part, in the case of soccer, the foot. The ball addresses the player in a limited way, as a specific kind of actionability flowing through the player's body following very particular channels. The kick is indeed an expression, but not of the player. It is an "ex-pression" of the ball, in the etymological sense, since the ball's attractive catalysis "draws out" the kick from the player's body and defines its expressive effect on the globality of the game. The player's body is a node of expression: not a subject of the play but a material channel for the catalysis of an event affecting the global state of the game. Whereas the ball is a catalyzer, and the goals are inducers, the node of expression is a transducer: a channel for the transformation of a local physical movement into another energetic mode, that of potential energy. Through the kick, human physicality transduces into the insubstantiality of an event, releasing a potential that reorganizes the entire field of potential movement.
