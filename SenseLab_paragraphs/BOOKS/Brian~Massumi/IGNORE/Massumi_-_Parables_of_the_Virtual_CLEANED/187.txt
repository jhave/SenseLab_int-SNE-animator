The membrane isn’t closed. It folds in at the mouth, ears, nostrils, eyes, anus, urethra, vagina, and pores. The mouth connects through the stomach and intestines to fold back out the anus. This is one leaky “box.” It’s closer to a Klein bottle: a two-dimensional topological figure. Even the skin isn’t really three-dimensional. It just acts as if it were. It creates a 3-D closure effect by regulating movements into and out of the space-filling fractal it twistedly envelopes. Biologically, it’s all an act, a complex nutritive, excretive act: circus of the body. We do not live in Euclidean space. We live between dimensions.
