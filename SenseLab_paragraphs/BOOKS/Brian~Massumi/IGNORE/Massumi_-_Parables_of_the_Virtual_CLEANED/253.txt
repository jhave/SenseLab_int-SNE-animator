Terms for collective agency are not necessary. To a logic of relation, the "individual" is already collective. Many times over. A part-object is the sign of a coming-together. It is in asymmetrical reciprocity with a part-subject. And such reciprocities always come in crowds--situations. Situations are always multi-levelled. Infinitely so, from the atomic on up. An infinity of substantializable elements is brought together in the most modest of expressive situations. That infinity must be multiplied by two right off the bat, since each substantializable level is doubled by a field of immanence, and each element by its potential as a modulation of that field. The only thing that makes this complexity thinkable is the channeling of that infinitely open interlocking of elements, levels, and fields in the eventful simplicity of sensation and the unity of modulatory movements doubling it. An exploration of relation must combine, among other things, a "critique of pure feeling" (Whitehead) with a philosophy of movement and multiplicity (Bergson). Since it concerns the eventful self-standing of the co-conditioning--happenstance--it is an exercise of contingent reason, neither "pure" nor exactly "practical" (yet  through its engagement with the sensible, nonetheless pragmatic).
