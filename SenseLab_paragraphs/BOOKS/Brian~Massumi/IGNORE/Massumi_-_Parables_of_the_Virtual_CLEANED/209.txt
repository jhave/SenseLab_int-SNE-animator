If the rules are ex post facto captures that take precedence, what do they take it from? From the process from which the game actually emerged, and continues to evolve, to the extent that circumstances arise that force modifications of the rules. The foundational rules follow and apply themselves to forces of variation that are endemic to the game, and constitute the real conditions of the game's emergence. The rules formally determine the game, but do not condition it (they are its formal cause, not its efficient cause).
