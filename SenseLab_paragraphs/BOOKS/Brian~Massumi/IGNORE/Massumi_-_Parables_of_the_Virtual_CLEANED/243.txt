The only way to bring matter back to "culture" is through a logic of non-dialectical relation. But "culture" would be demolished by that logic. Terms like "culture" or "society" are relational in the same way as "subjectivity," except they shift adjectivally rather than pronominally. If anything, the "cultural" displacement of subjectivity to the adjectival further entrenches the unacknowledged idealism, since it allows the generality of the subjective to predicate itself to any name, not just those capable of saying "I." It is perhaps a distinguishing characteristic of the "communicational" age to speak as if things had agency, as in the statement "television causes violence." When pressed, those who favor such formulations will invariably fall back on "society" or "culture." Terms for collective agency are carriers of idealism, vectors of hyper-hypostasization.
