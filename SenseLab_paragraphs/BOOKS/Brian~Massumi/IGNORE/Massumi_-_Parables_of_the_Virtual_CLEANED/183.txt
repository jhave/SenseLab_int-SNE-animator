The Argument from Outer Space. “Diverse astronomical observations agree that the density of matter in the cosmos is only a third of that needed for space to be Euclidean.”xx Attempts to study the size and shape of the universe have largely given up on Euclidean geometry, in favor of non-Euclidean hyperbolic topologies. Some strange twistings are required to account for the “lost” matter, the “dark” matter that stubbornly fails to show (insistence of the void). Strange void-related twistings also show up in the vicinity of a black hole, where events of cosmic scale funnel directly back into the quantum soup, in contravention of Euclidean gradations of scale. Understanding black holes and dark matter will have to wait for a “theory of everything”: a model connecting relativity (itself based on Reimannian geometry) to quantum mechanics. The most promising candidates are topological “superstring” theories, in which the world is described as as spaghetti of many-dimensioned, continuous strands in unimaginable contorsions.
