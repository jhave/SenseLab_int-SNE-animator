When the singularity recoils into itself, it unbecomes conventional meaning and rebecomes  affect: a liveliness of self-relation, a quality of self-insistence, a force of re-expression. The rhythm of mutual conversion between meaning and affect, between discursive currency and self-running singularity, between contextual capture and on-going escape, redundant sign and iterative force, termination and return--this is what is meant by experience.
