Architecture could even go synesthetes like MP one better by finding ways of building-in nonvisual hypersurfaces. There is nothing wrong with color, light and darkness. Rainbows of experience are good. But imagine the startling effects that might be achieved by using proprioception as the general plane of cross-referencing. Imagine how positively, qualitatively moving that would be. Practices of architecture allied with experimental art, like the “reversible destiny” architecture of Arakawa and Gins or the “relational” architecture of Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, might have much to contribute. Technologies could be favored that can be twisted away from addressing preexisting forms and functions toward operating directly as technologies of emergent experience. Imagine if these were to become infrastructural to architectural engineering. What better place to start than with the much-touted “new media,” approached not only as design tools but as architectural elements as basic as walls and windows? Could architecture build on the ability of digital technologies to connect and interfuse different spheres of activity on the same operational plane, to new effect? This is a direction in which the work of Lars Spuybroek, among others, is moving.
