Since they are determinately positioned neither in time nor space, their presence can only be considered a mode of abstraction. They are real--really perceived and mnemonically useful--abstract surfaces of perception. Since they continue indefinitely, in order to bring up certain regions the synesthete has to move around, into, or away from them. She doesnâ€™t actually walk, of course. The movement, though really perceived and mnemonically useful, does not measurably take place in Euclidean space. It is an intensive movement, occuring in place, or more accurately out-placed, in the event. This is an abstract movement on an abstract surface.
