Or rather, multilinearly expressed in competing histories of counter-foundation. For as earlier indicated, individuations always come in packs. States emerge between States, both geographically and temporally. Their emergence is cascading. Every State, no matter how "progressive," will create a class of victims in one way or another, from soft assimilation to brutal  expungement. This is a function of the general-particular mode of operating of the Static, which perceives the singular-multiple only in the negative and is not inclined to tolerate it. The State must translate anything that does not fit its transcendent model of the State "subject" or "citizen" into its own regulatory terms, if necessary by direct applications of force. Or it must expunge it. Containment is membranous, a regime of openness. No State could survive for long within a closed regime of openness (although some, like Albania and North Korea have tried). Containment is by nature porous. State boundaries are fissured. Even behind closed borders, there is always a "minority" already within the State whose presence is an irritation, to the purity its "Idea" as to its  representational sub-bodies: a fractal "citizenry" that is in it (its fissures) of the State but not of it. And is thus considered parasitic. There is always a fractalized population in the pores of the State that the State wants to exterminate like vermin, or at best to reduce to a functioning part of itself through the application of its model. There is always a Jew or a Palestinian within the State, or at its threshold.
