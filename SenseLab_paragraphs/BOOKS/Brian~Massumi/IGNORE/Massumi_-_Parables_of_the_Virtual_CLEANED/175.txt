It all becomes a question of modulation. This is a pragmatic rather than critical issue: how, concretely, can the virtual feedback of higher functions be used to re-modulate experience? How can unmediated inflections of sociality and literate interpretation be embedded in the direct experience of the built environment? How can cultural signs be encouraged to rematerialize, to feed back into a “smallness” of perception on a level with the movements of matter? How can the literate become literal and the literal literate, in two-way, creative interference? Most of all, how can this “involuntary but elicited” looping be accomplished openly and without moralizing--without the arrogance of deceit, the preciousness of conceit, or the imposition of an authorial “voice” or “vision” aiming to ground a world sea-legs?
