Wherever there is a political movement that requires its component bodies to narrate the tale of their determination by the past, and to extrapolate it into a determination of a model for the future as a logical progression from that past, bureaucracy and censorship are not far behind. Those who "understand" the past condemn the rest to repeat it--at least the part of it that involves Static regulation. "Resistance" of this kind is a claim to a piece of the State pie. History is the performative narration of usurpation of variation. It is a language of power. To the extent that it involves fictions of redemption or damnation, history is tanatamount to a State religion. It was accurate of structural anthropology to characterize so-called "primitive societies" as "societies without histories." Non-State groupings have becomings and evolutions, but no history--other than that of colonization, the "applied" history of State imperialism (in pre-twentieth century Europe, that history was explicitly couched in religious terms of "manifest"--as opposed to suspended--destiny). The failure of structuralism was that it managed to miss all three. It conflated becoming and evolution, transposing both into a "synchronic" condition. That conditon was indeed an immanent cause, but a formal rather than a real one (a condition of possibility rather than of real emergence). In the same gesture, history was transposed into the serial expression of permutational possibilities already latent in the generative matrix of the synchronic: a "diachrony." Possibility is how potential appears as a theoretical-fictional character in the present tense of the narration. If a fiction is a specter, then possibility is the shadow it casts on the narratively eclipsed present: the singularity of sensation twice removed.
