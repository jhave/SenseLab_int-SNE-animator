It is not that architecture does not already go about its business like this, in a certain regulatory manner, if not always fully cognizant of the strange horizon of that relational fact, and at times even in outright denial of it (as when it proudly deconstructs positively absent structures; or privileges determinations of history over potential becomings; or cutely cites when it could be effectively tweaking; or boringly domiciles the world in its own supposed pre-reflection). If architecture pursues extending diagrams into biograms it will become more what it has always been: a materialist art of qualitative body modulation; a translogical engineering of matter gone mindful. Its buildings will also be more what they are. More modulatory. More flexibly membranic. More intensely lived, between more relational dimensions brought concretely into abstract-surface proximity. How such an onto-topological architecture will develop, if it does, certainly cannot be pre-reflected. It will unfold experimentally. Or not.
