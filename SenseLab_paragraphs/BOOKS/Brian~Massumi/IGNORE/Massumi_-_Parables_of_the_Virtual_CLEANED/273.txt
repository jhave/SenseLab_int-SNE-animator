The future of the present is in the present, figured not as a point on a line but as a fractal in process. The future is in the transformative fissures and scalar spacings of the under-way (the actual). The present is radically open, self-standing in and between its processual voids. According to Benjamin, the "angel of history," history's redeemer, steps backwards into the opening. The "history" of the forwardly back-stepping (self-recursive) present is a modal conversion. It converts historiography (which, social constructionists tell us, makes history--and for once they're right) from an epistemology-in-the-imperative (a moralism) to an ethics, defined by the later Foucault as a coded practice of transformative self-standing whose primary mode is not that of the imperative (but instead the precept). "Ethics of the self" involve regularization: the inculcation of conducts, or habits. The habits are of self-transformation. Ethics is the regularization of becoming. What "regularization" as a predicate of becoming pragmatically involves is subject to any number of divergent channelings.
