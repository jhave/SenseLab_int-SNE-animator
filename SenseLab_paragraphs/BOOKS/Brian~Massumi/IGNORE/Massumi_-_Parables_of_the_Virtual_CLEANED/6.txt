Sets of nine-year old children were tested for recall, and asked to rate the version they saw on a scale of “pleasantness.” The factual version was consistently rated the least pleasant, and was also the worst remembered. The  most pleasant was the original wordless version, which was rated just slightly above the emotional. And it was the emotional version that was best remembered.
