What then is an "individual"? An individual is a crowd of part-subjects and part-objects that hang together. It is a self-standing frame for an equally crowded field of associated events. It is an ambulant prehension of channelings. A traveling node of nodes of expression. An "individual" is not indiv-"isible." It is a holding-together that can be divided, but changes in nature at each division (divide a human individual, for example, and it is apt to bleed, undergoing a qualitative change from health to illness). To avoid the connotatoin of indivisibility, Deleuze and Guattari prefer the word "dividual" [CITE]. The "dividual" holds together, and holds events together, in a way that their potential may be periodicallly re- accessed. An individul is a relational stockpile. It is a capturable accumulation of potential. As such, it also a stockpile of escape. The complexity of its infinite composition will always yield a residue of potential in excess over its containment. It is always stylized, as a rhythm of containment and escape.
