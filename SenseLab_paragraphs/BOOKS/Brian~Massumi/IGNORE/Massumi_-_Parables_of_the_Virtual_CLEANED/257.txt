Examples of symbiotic supplementation include the emergence of multicellular life itself. Many subcellular elements of multicellular organisms (organelles, mitochondria, cilia, etc.) were at one time independent creatures [Wesson, 159-60]. Their integration into larger unicellular organisms conditioned a quantum in leap in the complexity of their event-channeling. Colonies of  unicellular organisms became composite individuals encompassing still partially autonomous sub-individuals whose combined potential for event-channeling was far greater than the sum of their parts. It is even thought that gametes were once independent creatures, and that the meiosis at the basis of sexual reproduction is the remnant of a formerly autonomous process of asexual reproduction, multicellularly captured [Margulis and Sagan]. This is interesting in the context of "cultural" theory because it stands the received wisdom that sexual difference is the model for multiplicity on its gamete. Sexual reproduction is a processual expression of a much more encompassing multiplicity. Sexual difference is a derivative of differentiation, one that does not directly concern opposition or contradiction, but pertains instead to multiplicities, to populations: always more than one (diverging-together). The differentiation or diverging-together of which sexual difference is a derivative is evolution (what Foucault called "genealogy," clearly not unintending the allusion to sexuality). The additivity of individuals is not a supplanting (as in theories of "the" Other). It is an evolutionary supplementation: iso-processual drift.
