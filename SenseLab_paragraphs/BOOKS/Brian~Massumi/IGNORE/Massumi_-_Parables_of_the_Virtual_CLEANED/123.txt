The novelty of computer-assisted topological design technique in architecture is wearing off. As the required software has become more accessible, not to mention the hardware required to run it, paperless studios and offices now seem much the less exception. The proponents of the topological turn in architecture have by this time had ample published opportunity to explain its theoretical underpinnings, and have produced an expanding body of design work available for assessment. Whenever a “next wave” starts to crest, its growing familiarity is inevitably accompanied by a backlash. I won’t say “backwash,” even though there are a certain refrains discernible in the reaction that are close to eddying into a prevailing opinion. The criticisms are often articulated in connection with the work of Greg Lynn, whose elegant philosophizing and tantalizingly involuted forms have made him an exemplar of the new approaches. Here are three of them:
1) We do not live in non-Euclidean space. So where do you get off foisting mutant geometries on us that don’t correspond to anything outside the abstract space of the computer? (Subtext: that don’t correspond to anything real).
2) Go on, animate architectural design practice as much as you like, you still end up with a building that isn’t going anywhere. It’s all a sham, because design techniques based on movement rather than static form betray themselves in the fixity of their final product. Where is the continuity between the process and the product? If there is none, what difference do your fancy design methods make? It’s all very pretty, but why should we care?
3) Topological architecture is too abstract. It lacks a concept of the body. Where’s the beef?
