But can the same be said of "culture" and "society"? These are substantialized "terms" whose hyper-hypostasis has been taken them so adjectivally far afield that they immaterialize with no substantial let alone singular residue. They have no body. Nothing channels a "culture" or a "society" as a whole, as a substantializable term that can be held in any pragmatic sense to enter into extrinsic relation with another term on its own ontological level. "Societies" and "cultures" only interact by stepping down. They interact through bodies that are nominally a "part-" of them (through their artifacts). "Social" or "cultural" interaction is always at the part-object or part-subject level. At that level, they are superfluous "terms." If substantialization is the goal, "subject" or "object" do just fine. Why cling to "society" and "culture"? If "subjectivity" is immaterial, a hyper-hypostasized absorption of relationality, then terms for collective agency such as "society" and "culture" carry that hypostasis to a higher level. They are immateriality raised to a higher power, so high that they explode in a poof of adjectives. It is of course not news to Cultural Studies, for example, that "culture," the master term it loves to hate, is a fiction. But it may be grist for thought (or better, a slowing of thought, considering the quantity and turn-over in publications in the field) to observe that "culture" is not a "real fiction." It is so hypostasized, so powerfully immaterial, as to be a spectral fiction. The "cultural" is the specter of subjectivity, that long discredited term, haunting Cultural Studies at a remove.
