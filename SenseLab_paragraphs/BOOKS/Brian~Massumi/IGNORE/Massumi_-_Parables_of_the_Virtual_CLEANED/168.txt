We have seen this double system of reference before. The discrete perceptions/cognitions that are actually extracted provide the elementary building blocks for compound forms and configurations. They feed into metric, Euclidean space and the present of linear time associated with it. The relational, variational continuum pertains to a qualitative space that can only be described topologically. Its recursivity cannot be ignored, so it is as immediately a nonlinear temporality as it is a non-Euclidean space.
