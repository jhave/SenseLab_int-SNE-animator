Thus a collective individuation may have a destiny. Or more accurately, collective individuations are always suspended between more than one destiny simultaneously ("neo-finalism": the non-teleological theory of destiny, in which ends are in suspense [Raymond Ruyer]).  Their only destiny in the normal sense of the term is open-ended evolution. For in the potentializing tension between the poles of destiny, anything can happen. But again, a history is another matter altogether.
