The "fetish" in its anthropological sense (stripped of its negative connotations to mean simply "ritual element") effects a similar step-down from the general-particular to the singular-multiple in the event-space of religion. Religion is a collectively individuating potentialization-and-containment that only derivatively or supplementarily concerns belief, just as "relationships" only derivatively or supplementarily concern the "meaning" of humanoid being-together (its implicitly presupposed content or founding structure, as opposed to its event). Religion--for that matter, any and all affiliative comings-together of sensitive bodies--are directly, unsublimatedly sexual. A religion is a transmissible regime of sensation, a contagious technology of intensification, a becoming-intense.
