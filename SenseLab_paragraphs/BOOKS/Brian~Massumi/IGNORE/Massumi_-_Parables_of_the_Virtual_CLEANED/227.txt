There are other perspectives on the game besides the referee's. The fans also 
individualize players, and teams, attributing them intrinsic properties and ordering the  seriality of their extrinsic relatings into the linearity of a recognizable history (a model progression). The way in which the audience's perspective is included in the game is not through regulatory application, but by affective means. The excitement or disappointment of the stadium audience adds auditory elements to the mix that directly contribute to modulating the intensity of the field of potential. The audience feedback is itself modulated by the spectators' accumulated individualizations of the game--their already-constituted knowledge of and attachment to the histories of the players and teams.
