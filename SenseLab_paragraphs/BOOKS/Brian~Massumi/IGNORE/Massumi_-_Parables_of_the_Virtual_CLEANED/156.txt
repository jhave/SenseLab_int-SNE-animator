To do this would require somehow integrating logics of perception and experience into the modeling. Processes like habit and memory would have to be taken into account. As would the reality of intensive movement. Ways would have to be experimented with of architecturally soliciting an ongoing eliciting of emergent forms-functions at the collective hinge of perception, hallucination, and cognition. Techniques would have to be found of overfilling experience, avoiding prefiguring it. The methods would have to operate in a rigorously anexact way, in order to respect the vagueness of the virtual and the openness of its individual endings.
