In Ruyer’s vocabulary, this immediate dynamic straddling of disparate perspectives without the vantage point of a supplementary dimension is called absolute survey (absolute in the sense that it is overlookesque without the outside vantage point that would make it merely relative to the situation, in external oversight of it). Absolute survey is another name for the mode of existence that is sympathy, induced into being, in the act of intuition. Ruyer also calls it primary consciousness, corresponding to a first degree of mentality (for the jointness-in-difference of disparate perspectives in absolute survey already surpasses the disjunctiveness of the given, without erasing it; Ruyer 1958, 95–131).
