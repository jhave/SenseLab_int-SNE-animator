The surplus-value of life that is one with the -esqueness of the vital gestures of play corresponds to what Raymond Ruyer calls that activity’s aesthetic yield (1958, 142). The aesthetic yield is the qualitative excess of an act lived purely for its own sake, as a value in itself, over and against any function the act might also fulfill. The yield is a surplus of vivacity, paradoxically arrived at by force of abstraction. Ruyer’s proposition is even more radical: he says that every instinctive act produces an aesthetic yield. This places play on a continuum of instinct and, conversely, instinct on the artistic spectrum. It is then a question of emphasis whether you consider play a variety of instinct, or instinct a carrier of play. Both are correct: mutual differential inclusion, with artistry as the operator of the inclusion.
