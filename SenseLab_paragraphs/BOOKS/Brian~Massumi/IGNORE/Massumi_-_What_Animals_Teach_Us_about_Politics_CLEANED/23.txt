This essay is an extended thought experiment in what an animal politics can be. Its aim is to construct the concept of an animal politics and carry it to the limit of what it can do, with sympathy and creativity, starting in play and ending in play (in much the same way that Whitehead says that philosophy starts in wonder and, when all is said and done, the wonder remains; 1968, 168).
