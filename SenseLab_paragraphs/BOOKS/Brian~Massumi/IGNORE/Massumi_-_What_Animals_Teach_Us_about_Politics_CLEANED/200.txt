The structure of human politics is not all that there is in force. There is a leftover of animal politics, a residual excess of it stirring in the background of the background, in the self-overspilling tendency plying the field of nature’s continuum. The zoo-ological figure/ground—the distorted map and the institutional territory, respectively—stands out against this moving background. The background of the still-stirring supernormal tendency double-frames the zoo-ological structure in its own potential ungrounding. It represents the potential deterritorialization of the structure. This ungrounding background is nothing other than the self-affirmation of animal vitality, the self-driving enthusiasm of the body that can never be entirely stilled. Vital stirrings microshake the structure. This is always the case. There are always incipient movements of escape in even the most humanly watertight of structures, riddling it with minifissures, threatening to undermine it like a dike springing leaks. There is always a supernormal tendency toward escape, even from the cottony pleasures of sentimentality compensating for the horror of the barbarity of what the human most prides itself on, perhaps most arrogantly where the pridefulness passes unacknowledged as a political issue: the exceptionalism of its species being.
