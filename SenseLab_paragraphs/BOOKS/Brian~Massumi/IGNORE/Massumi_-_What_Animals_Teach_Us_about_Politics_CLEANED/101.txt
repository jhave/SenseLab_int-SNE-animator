This same logic applies to all contrastable terms. Which way it makes sense to construe their contrast, as a difference in degree or a difference in kind, will vary according to the problem and the particular conceptbuilding task at hand. The only way of avoiding this oscillation is to replace both terms with a notion of modal difference, where the distinctions to be made are between modes of activity (qualitatively different dynamic forms). Modal difference concerns differentials between tendencies that are variably coactive in every event, their coactivity iteratively expressing itself in an emergent line of continual variation. Every distinction made in this essay has been between contrasting tendencies. Modal logic is a radically event-based activist logic that avoids both the implicit presupposition of substance carried by the notion of difference in kind, and the connotation of measurable quantity carried by the notion of difference in degree. Tendencies are neither substantive nor quantifiable. The logic of mutual inclusion is ultimately a modal logic of continual variation. This logic begins to germinate anywhere tendencies are taken seriously, and with them the qualitative and subjective factors of nature. Most especially, the supernormal tendency of play.36
But all of this still doesn’t tell us in what way instinct is sympathy. At this point in the account, that is the crucial question, because it points us straight in the direction of this essay’s stated aim: to begin to express what animals teach us about politics.
