To continue: Call politico-pathological any tendency that frames itself through a desire to avoid lived abstraction. Reinforcing the separating line between structured differences in order to brace the framing against the slippage and blurring that comes with paradox corresponds to neurotic normativity, which invests itself body and soul in the compulsion to repeat the same, to the extent humanly possible. This is Jean Oury’s normopathy (Guattari 1995, 72). Normopathy magnifies the minimal difference opened by the paradox of play into a monumental difference that is taken overseriously. The gap is erected into a structural divide, which is defended at all costs in the name of “the way things are.” No mixing allowed: play or fight, but for sanity’s sake don’t contrive to do both at once.
