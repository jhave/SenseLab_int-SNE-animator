at once: on the one hand anchored in what was given and, on the other, tending to finesse a way to surpass it; the back-pull of established necessity and the pulling forward to the new. Or to put it in other words: acquiescence to what is nonoptional on one side and the spontaneity of appetition on the other; pathos (the sinking-anchor feeling of acquiescence to the nonoptional) and the flight of fancy of passion; incorporation into the givenness of the event and the artificing of a way through it with supernormal zest; the corporeality of lived importance and the vitality of lived abstraction, in productively eventful tension. What effectively occurs is how this tension works itself out. Paradoxically, by this definition, “the” body is not reducible to corporeality. Restyled as bodying, “the body” includes the movement by which corporeality surpasses itself: it includes the mental pole of the event.
