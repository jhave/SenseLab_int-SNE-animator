What the gesture of absolute deterritorialization does is suspend the extensive unfolding. It doesn’t act the potential actions out. It holds them together, purely in their relation to each other, in tightest, most intimate embrace, in a written zone of indiscernibility. It in-acts them. It gives pure expression to their reciprocal immanence. In this zone of indiscernibility, the internal relations invoked as tendential potential actions running counter to the familial context make themselves felt in all their covariant integrality, without their difference blurring but, paradoxically, in the actual absence of an alternate context corresponding to the existential territory being played. A human becoming-bird, for example, does not invade the nest, like a cuckoo. The potential actions are purely played, unframed and thus without assignable limits. They are purely expressed, co-immanent to the expressive gesture of writing. They are dramatized by that gesture in the role of pure, future possibilities, unframed, their only limit the horizon of animality itself. Like every horizon, the horizon of animal recedes as it is approached: it is an absolute limit; a real, virtual limit. Also like all horizons, it liminally envelops the field of possibility of movement in its integrality. In the suspension of the actual animal context, the approach to the animal limit extends the integrality of the internal relations of the in-acted tendencies to the absolute, integral horizon of the animal.
In a written animal-becoming, unlike in nonhuman animal play such as that of wolf cubs, what is played is not a particular function of the animal, like predation. The “plot line” of the story is an envelope for the integral animal to express itself in all its immanent intensity. The actions that are expressly dramatized do transduce something of the commanding form of the animal analogue of the becoming: the something-extra of it.
