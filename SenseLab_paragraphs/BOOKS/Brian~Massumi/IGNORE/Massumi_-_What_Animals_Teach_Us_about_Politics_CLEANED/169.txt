This is how all becomings-animal work, even nonwritten ones, like the case Deleuze and Guattari cite in which the actual act of gnawing on metal like a chew toy was the supernormal gesture catalyzing a becoming-dog, in contrast to the example of the written tying of dog-shoes with human paws (1987, 274â€“275). It is the same basic principle when a human engages a becoming-animal in nonverbal gestural: an expressive act, triggering a becoming affectively between, without an end-term become. The difference is how far toward the horizon of animality the act can tend, how intense the expression can get, how integrally far its movement of surpassing the given goes. The written act goes the furthest, most intensely. In the gestural acting-out as in the verbal in-acting, both the human and the animal are extracted from their normal contexts, abstracted from their customary frames. Their gestures are subtracted from already recognized and adaptively honed functions. Reciprocal unframing. Double deterritorialization. Double abstraction. This is what all ludic gestures of becoming have in common. What is special about the written gesture is that it gives free range to the instinctive movement of supernormality running the full length of the animal continuum immanent to the life of humans and nonhumans alike.
