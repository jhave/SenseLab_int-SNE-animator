The act of intuition dramatically mutually includes at least two noncoinciding perspectives. It plays the in-between. In the immediacy of its enaction, it is already transindividual, in the sense of inhabiting the gaps between individual perspectives. It manages this without rising to a higher supplementary dimension that would give it an overlook upon the situation, as if from outside it. That is what cognition does. Intuition, in the directness of its thinking-doing, plays the immanent in-between gapping the situation.
