The tendential logic of mutual inclusion assigns two tasks to the metamodelization of the creative life of the animal. First, its theory of the political must always start with the gesture of analyzing mixes, understood not as combinations of terms in external relation to one another (combinatorics, part-by-part assemblage, hybridization) but in terms of mutual inclusion, with the effective paradoxes that go with that. The evaluation of vital events must begin with an evaluation of the tendencies in play. Once their limit-poles and orientations are sorted out, the question becomes the degree and nature of their participation in the enactive gestures in play, the ensuing movements they catalyze, and the existential territories these movements involve. The two evaluative criteria discussed above pertaining to intensity are grounded in this analysis of tendential mixtures, and owe their discriminative capacities to it.
