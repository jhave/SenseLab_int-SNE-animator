For Tinbergen this remained just a curious episode that did not prompt him to change his model. The animal, for him, remained a machine, albeit one of “great complexity” and not a little uncertainty, like a “slot machine” (1965, 68). His conclusion about supernormal stimuli? “No one has quite been able to analyze such matters,” he noted with more than a hint of irritation at the uncooperative animals, “yet somehow, they are accomplished” (1965, 68). It is precisely the “somehow” of this accomplishment of baby birds to frustrate the learned expectations of the scientist that needs to be retained and integrated into our notions of animality. The failure of mechanistic assumptions of the traditional theory to account for the uncertainty-producing complexity of instinctual behavior cannot be compensated for by a trip to Las Vegas.
