Human sentimentality edits the complexion. It highlights the categorical affect, duly converted, and brings its thematic “what” to selective emphasis. This downplays the singular “how” of the element of vitality affect. It brings the genericness of the situation into emphasis over its singularity, and mutes its dynamism. As a result of this muting of the dynamic form of the event, the “what” appears less as a dimension of an event, and more like a thing. It is felt as the qualified content of the event. Through identificatory projection, sentimentality reflects the relational content back onto the individual. The “what” it is about is felt as something each individual has inside itself, as a function of its particular point of view on the situation. Point of view: an outlook on the content. Feeling comes now as if from a supplementary dimension, at a mediated distance. This changes the affective complexion of the situation. The weighting shifts in favor of the categorical affect in play and its generic thematism, effectively converting the individual’s primary absorption in the transindividual affect of the situation into a privately possessed, conventionalized emotion. This interiorizing conversion of the transindividual affective complex into the currency of conventional human emotion is what brings the situation under the sway of human politics. It translates animal sympathy into human emotion.
