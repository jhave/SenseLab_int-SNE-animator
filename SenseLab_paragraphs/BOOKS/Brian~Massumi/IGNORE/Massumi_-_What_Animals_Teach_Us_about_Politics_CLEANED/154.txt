14. Instinct runs the full length of the  integrated  animal  continuum, along reciprocally presupposing lines of ever-diversifying variation. These lines of variation stretch all the way through to the most human of accomplishments, including of a linguistic nature. The self-driving movement of instinct, under the propulsion of the supernormal tendency, is what operationally includes the human in the animal. To think the human is to think the animal, and to think the animal is to think instinct. Would it even be possible to conceive of an animal without instinct? Why, then, the widespread embarrassment at the term? Why must it always be played down, like some beastly Victorian secret best left unsaid? Animal politics has no fear of instinct.
