It is not play that is modeled on the form of combat — it is the form of combat that is modulated by play. Far from play being slavishly subordinated to the functions of its analog arenas of activity, it is these functions that depend, for their continued functionality, on the powers of variation native to play. Success in fighting a foe or evading a predator is increased by an animal’s power to improvise on the spot. When this happens, vital function has captured the expressive value of the gestures and channeled it toward its own instrumental ends. It is in fact instrumental action that is parasitic upon play. Life profits from the surplus-value of life produced by play, converted into survival value. Capture: only an autonomous activity can be captured. Play, and the expressivity to which it dedicates itself, constitutes an autonomous domain of life activity, one that is fundamentally insubordinate to the logic of adaptation, even if it may be usefully captured by it under certain circumstances. This inverts the relation between play and its analog arenas. Instead of play slavishly conforming to them, it is in fact variations on their forms that are invented by play, and then secondarily take on adaptive function.
