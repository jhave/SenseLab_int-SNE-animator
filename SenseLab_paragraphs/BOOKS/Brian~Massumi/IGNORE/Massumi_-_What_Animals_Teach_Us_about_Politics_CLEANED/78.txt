Earlier, the enthusiasm of the body expressed by the animal abandoning itself to play was characterized as a vitality affect (or what was just called “tone”). Vitality affect is adverbial. It concerns the “how” of the performance: its manner of execution (its style). The how was bound up with the artifice of -esqueness. It was what Deleuze would call a “power of the false.” The circuit of reciprocal potentialization expressed in the vitality affect of play is a power of the false in that it “posits the simultaneity of incompossible presents” in its instantaneous back-and-forthing between now and the future and between disparate domains of activity (Deleuze 1989, 131; trans. modified).
