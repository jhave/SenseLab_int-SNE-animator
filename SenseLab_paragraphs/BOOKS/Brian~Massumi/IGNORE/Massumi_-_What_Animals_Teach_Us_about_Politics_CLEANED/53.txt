There is no reason not to consider this power of abstraction a kind of reflexivity. The general situation (plug the burrow) is reflected in the lived singularity (plug this burrow thus, here and now). This is a lived reflexivity, one with the inventive gestures that express it. Ruyer, as well as Bergson, extends this brain-free mental power all the way down to the amoeba, and even to the individual cells composing multicellular animal bodies (Ruyer 1958, 103–106).11 “It would be as absurd,” writes Bergson, “to refuse consciousness to an animal because it has no brain as to declare it incapable of nourishing itself because it has no stomach” (Bergson 1998, 110). Thus even at an evolutionary stage prior to play laying claim to its own independent arenas of activity and signing that difference as its own in -esqueness, there was already an element of play in all instinctive acts. All acts of instinct are capable of affirming an expressive force of variation, as a power of singularization generating surplus-values of life. Every act, even the most instrumental, is fringed by a margin of improvisational expressiveness. Instinct is not limited to the automatic repetition of a reflex arc triggered by an inherited memory trace. This is one aspect of instinct. But it must not be forgotten that each “stereotyped” repetition of an instinctive act may potentially arc in the improvised future direction of the genesis of forms of life, of the expression of new variations on life’s constitutive modes of activity.
Ruyer, Bergson, and Bateson consider this power of expressive mentality to be the leading edge of evolution. It is the very engine of evolution, responsible for inventing the forms that come to be selected as adaptive. Bergson argues that this inventive force for variation is in operation even where forces of chance mutation are at work. A mutation in one element requires the surrounding elements to reconfigure themselves around it.
