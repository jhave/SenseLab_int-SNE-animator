The sovereign state of exception is the constitutively sterile dialectic between these two opposing strategies for avoiding the affirmation of lived abstraction. Bateson remarks that in the absence of paradoxes of (lived) abstraction, the evolution of communication, which he says is inseparable from the evolution of life, “would be at an end” (193). The sovereign structure of human politics is antibecoming. To the extent to which life is one with its creative evolution, human politics is antilife.
All three components of human politics—the figure of the human, the ground of the animal against which it stands out, and the zone of indifference exploited by the state of exception through which this structural difference is suspended for refoundational reframing—can be considered pathological according to Bateson’s criteria. The concern Bateson and Agamben share for framing, double-framing, and paradox authorizes us to think the political and the “psychological” together, remembering, once again, that we are talking not about “the” subject, but about subjectivities-without-a-subject. Or to be exact, that we are talking about qualitative movements of a tendential nature in which the subject has no being, but only extra-being, coinciding with the element of pure expression in becoming. This means that there is ultimately just one subject, and it is multiple: the transindividual subject of the integral animal surpassing itself (as discussed in Supplement 1).
