Tinbergen concluded that the instinctive sequence of actions did not in fact depend on any isolatable property, belonging either to the form of the presumed stimulus or to the ground against which it stood out. “There is no absolute distinction between effective sign-stimuli and the non-effective properties of the object” (1951, 42). What brought the response was not understandable in terms of isolatable properties, but was irreducibly relational. “Such ‘relational’ or ‘configurational’ stimuli,” he reflected, “seem to be the rule rather than the exception” (1965, 68). What the herring gull chick was responding to, he concluded, was an intensification effect produced by deformations integrally affecting all of the elements present in their relation to each other. Integrally linked deformations are the province of topology. What Tinbergen had discovered was a topology of experience in which the diverse elements in play are swept together in the direction of their own integral variation, in a dynamic state of mutual inclusion.
