Something is lost in the human-political translation. The interiorization of categorical affect, downplaying the enthusiasm of the body of vitality affect, contains the experience in its own generality. It is the genericness of the theme that now carries the most weight. The singular inventive potential of the situation is sidelined, as is its transindividual dimension. This production of individualized human emotion is highly political, wherever it occurs. It is a way of minimizing the inventive potential tendentially at play. It helps assure that what transpires in the end will be a refoundation of a prior order based on categorical distinctions already generically in place. It makes for a situation in which the theme is most unlikely to spontaneously overspill its parameters and the pregiven alternatives inscribed in them. Take a generic lover’s spat. Its unfolding is largely plotted in advance. You don’t know how it will end only because it isn’t yet certain which of two mutually exclusive endings will eventuate (rupture or reconciliation). In all situations where the experience of vitality affect has been de-emphasized in relation to categorical affect, so that the emotional side of the affective coin always lands facing up, there are only two hedonic alternatives: pleasure or pain; happy or sad. Hollywood, here we come.
