The gesture of written becoming is every much as real as the nonverbally gestured effective paradox that catapults the animal into the arena of play in nature, in a transformation-in-place that does not affect one without affecting two. But rather than acting it out, it in-acts the contagion of this transformation-in-place without the actual animal in play. It subtracts the actual animal in play in nature, in order to put the very nature of the animal into play. All the more potentially. This maximally abstract counterparticipation in nature’s potential, achieved only with the utmost of artifice, is the intensest expression of nature’s value. As a value, it stands-for one thing: universal animal sympathy.
