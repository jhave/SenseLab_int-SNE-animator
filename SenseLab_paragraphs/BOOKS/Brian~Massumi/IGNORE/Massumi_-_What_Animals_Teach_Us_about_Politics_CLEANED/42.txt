There is an “-esqueness” to the ludic gesture that marks its qualitative difference from the analog gestures of the arena of activity that is being played upon. The gestures’ -esqueness is the performative signature of the mode of abstraction at play. It embodies the “standing for” in Bateson’s formula. In other words, it is the enactive sign of the action’s value. In itself, it is pure standing-for, pure expressive value—the very element of the ludic in expression, as a form of lived abstraction. The -esqueness of the act instantiates the play-value of the game.
