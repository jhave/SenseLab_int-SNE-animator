As already mentioned, to live up to its pragmatic vocation, animal politics must not only think about mutual inclusion; it must practice it. For members of the human species, its practice involves “becoming-animal,” as conceptualized by Deleuze and Guattari (see Supplements 1 and 2, below). Animal thinking-doing avoids the too facile gesture of simply blurring generic differences. It is not content to deconstruct, or to preach the virtues of the hybrid (the concept of hybridization is based on mixes not between tendencies, but between already-given forms, and its logic is combinatory rather than creative). Animal thought does in fact affirm generic differences—differences in kind—but in its own way: in absolute survey. It affirms them without attributing any foundational status to them. It plays them with, and against, continuums of differences in degree, ultimately sweeping them all up in the interpenetrating movement of still-more-difference-producing tendency. It immanently surveys the inclusion of differences in the field of life and consciousness, affirming them from the singular angle of mutually inclusive becoming.
