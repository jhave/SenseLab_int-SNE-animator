11. Critical attentiveness to the human dynamic of identification enables strategies for a reclaiming of training and domestication, in spite of the self-evident power asymmetries, as in the work of Donna Haraway (2007) and Vinciane Despret (Despret and Porcher 2007). Parenthetically, there is a misunderstanding in Haraway, often repeated, of Deleuze and Guattari’s infamous statement that “anyone who likes dogs or cats is a fool” (1987, 240). The quote is taken out of context.
Deleuze and Guattari are specifically speaking about the Oedipal familialization of companion animals (cats and dogs sentimentally treated as human children).
The critique is against this human gesture of projective identification. It is in no   way directed against dogs or cats, or pets in general—or even against humans who keep companion animals in general. Any animal, the passage continues, even dogs and cats, even zoo animals, can participate in becomings with the human (241).
“Are there Oepidal animals with which one can ‘play Oedipus,’ play family, my little dog, my little cat, and then other animals that by contrast draw us into an irresistible becoming? Or another hypothesis: Can the same animal be taken up by two opposing functions and movements, depending on the case?” (233). Deleuze and Guattari clearly fall on the side of the second hypothesis: it is a question not of any essential characteristic of humans or animals, but rather of “opposing functions and movements.”
12. “The imitator always creates the model, and attracts it” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 13). For Deleuze and Guattari’s critique of imitation in relation to becominganimal, see 1987 (10–11, 237–239).

14. For a complementary analysis of a ludic human-animal encounter occurring in a zoo between an adult bonobo and a human adult, see Manning (2013, 210–214).
15. See Jakob von Uexküll’s “composition theory of nature” (Uexküll 2010, 171–
194) and Deleuze and Guattari’s variation on it (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 314; Deleuze 1988a, 126–127).
16. Ronald Rose-Antoinette (2013), working specifically with the cinematic image, develops an ontology of the image as “transapparition” consonant with this approach to perception. The image is analyzed in terms of immanent expressive force of transindividual intensity, with special attention to its more-than-human dimension.
