Bateson, interestingly, includes “histrionics” in the “complex of phenomena” composing the field of play, all of which involve some kind of play on the distinction between the map and the territory (Bateson 1972, 181). Could not the surface of zoo-ological identification be considered a projective map of the zoo as a territory of interspecies encounter producing an anamorphic (ana-anthropomorphic) distortion of it? Keeping an eye on the anamorphosis is crucial, because the surface of identification is in no way an undistorted map of the structure of human politics for which it provides moral support. The blurring of the structure is a working part of this particular instantiation of the structure. In other words, as a gesture of mapping, it doesn’t actually cover the territory to which it applies its metalayer, in the sense of plotting each point on its surface to a corresponding point on the territory. Enactively, the map is actually an added piece to the territory’s multilevel structuring. It is a part of it, with a selective function as regards the territory of the zoo: to edit distortedly out.
