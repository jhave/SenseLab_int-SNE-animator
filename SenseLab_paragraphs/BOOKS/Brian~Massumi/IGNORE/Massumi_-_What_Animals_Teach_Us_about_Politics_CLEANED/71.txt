Animal play rolls this reflexivity into the nonverbal gesture. A sequence of combatesque gestures charts the form of combat. It repeats the dynamic form of combat, without the combat. In so doing, it constitutes a directly lived, enactive cartography. This is not a cartography that limits itself to conforming to the given contours of the dynamic form it draws. It goes further, to improvise on the given form. It prolongs the gestural lines with which it draws the lived map of the given form, through stylistic extras and excesses that introduce the never-seen-before. Newness flourishes on the terrain of life. This kind of cartography creates the territory it maps, in new emergent variations on an existing arena of activity. In this ludic mode of reflexivity, it is essentially the future that is played. The ludic gesture mutually includes combat and game in each other in order to establish an instantaneous back-and-forth between the present and the future.
