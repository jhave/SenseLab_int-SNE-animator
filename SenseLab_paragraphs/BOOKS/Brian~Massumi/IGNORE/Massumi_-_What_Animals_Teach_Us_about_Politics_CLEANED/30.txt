First, Bateson is underlining the fact that the ludic gesture is a form of abstraction. In addition to being a performative effecting a transformationin-place, the ludic gesture carries an element of metacommunication, which is to say, of reflexivity. It is commenting on what it’s doing as it’s doing it: “these actions in which we now engage . . .” This “commentary” comes in the form of a stylistic difference. In play, you don’t bite, you nip. The difference between biting and nipping is what opens the analogical gap between combat and play. It is the style of the gesture that opens the minimal difference between the play gesture and its analogue in the arena of combat. The gesture performs a move, with all immediacy of an instantaneous transformation-in-place, while in the very same move it performs an abstraction on its action: reflecting upon it on the metalevel of commentary, and gapping it with an analogical distance of reciprocal difference.
