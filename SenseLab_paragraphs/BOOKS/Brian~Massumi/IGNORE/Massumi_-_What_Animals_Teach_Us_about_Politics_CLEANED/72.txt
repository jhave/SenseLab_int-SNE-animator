It goes without saying that these stretchings forward of the dynamic forms of life may sweep up the shape of the territory itself in movements of becoming. We saw that the supernormal stimuli that are the passion of herring gulls comprise relational blocks of experiential qualities whose integral linkage does not respect the distinction between figure and ground and are attributable to no isolatable property of either. It is not hard to imagine the supernormal tendency of the chick attaching to a structural element of the nest. It is not inconceivable that this deformational pressure might in the long run lead to an adaptive advantage associated with a variation in nest design that ends up passing the checkpoint of selection, all as a secondary effect of the animalsâ€™ appetitive self-driving. In this case, the mental power of play will have modified the physical map of the territory.
