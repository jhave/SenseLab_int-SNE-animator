Following the principle of double framing, this zone of indifference that is the simple opposite of structure must be recognized as a constitutive element of structuration. It is the unformed against which this form of framing (the correlative coupling of the structure and its environment) stands out. The structural difference (in the zoo-ological case, animal versus human) figured as the content of the framing, sets itself off from this doubled background of indifference. But it does so at the price of wedding itself to it, as its own logical condition of possibility. The zone of indifference is the negative premise in opposition to which the structural difference upholds itself. As logically conditioned, the double framing is a double opposition: human versus animal, and human-versus-animal versus undifferentiation. In productive animal paradoxes, on the other hand, the differences in play are not reducible to oppositions. Rather than a zone of indifference, they have the zone of indiscernibility of difference (the included middle). They do not appeal to merely logical conditions of possibility, but enactively plug into real conditions of emergence.3 Their constitution is not of a preponderantly logical nature, mediated by opposition, but is naturally vital, in all immediacy.
