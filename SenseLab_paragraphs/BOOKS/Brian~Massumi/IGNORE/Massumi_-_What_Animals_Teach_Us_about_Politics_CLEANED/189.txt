If, against this defense, in spite of normopathic sanity’s best efforts, differences fuse into a zone of indifference in which categories of being can no longer be tendentially discerned, the gap between logical levels and the divide between mutually exclusive terms implode. The sign is taken seriously as denoting what it would denote. This entails a confusion between the “is” and the “could be,” in the effective absence of any potential line of enactively performable gesture providing a transformative line of flight forward. The normopathic suppression of the zone of indifference lifts. The background of all structure rises to the surface. Appetition, of course, does not cease. It is the nature of appetition never to cease. Under these conditions, its ceaseless movement can now only go in circles. It can discern difference and the distinction between logical categories only long enough to fall back into a confusion between “is” and “could be.” This results in a hyperproduction of associative links indifferent to the distinction between corporeal fact and possibility, the one too easily segueing into the other. Oddly, the implosion of the sign into denoting what it would denote results in a compulsively associative slippage. What slips away is the potential for an enactively performable transformation. In the processual absence of that gestural potential for transformation-in-place, a feeling of impotence sets in. This feeling follows its own slippery slope, tending to develop into a foreboding, and then a menace, even a persecution. The tendency, in a word, is toward paranoia. This is the psychotic flip side of normopathy (using the word psychotic in a broad, nontechnical sense).
