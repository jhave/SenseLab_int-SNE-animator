The theme is on one side and the other. It is everywhere in the situation, differentially distributed across the diversity of the roles set into play. Here and there, and everywhere distributed, the theme is “nonlocalisable” (Ruyer 1952, 12). It is the tendential flavor of the situation. It is the “what” that is going on, as oriented by a tendential movement sweeping through the situation. There is a genericness to the thematic unfolding, in that the general parameters of the outcome are given in advance.
