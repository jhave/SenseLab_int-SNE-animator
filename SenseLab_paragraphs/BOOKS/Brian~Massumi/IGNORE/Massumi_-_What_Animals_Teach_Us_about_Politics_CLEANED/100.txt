There is a one-word synonym for differential mutual inclusion: life. Life lurks in the zone of indiscernibility of the crisscrossing of differences, of every kind and degree. At each pulse of experience, with each occurring remix, there emerges a new variation on the continuum of life, splayed across a multiplicity of coimplicating distinctions. The evolution of life is a continual variation across recurrent iterations, repeating the splay always with a difference. Because of this recurrent crisscrossing of coinvolved differences, evolution is never linear.
