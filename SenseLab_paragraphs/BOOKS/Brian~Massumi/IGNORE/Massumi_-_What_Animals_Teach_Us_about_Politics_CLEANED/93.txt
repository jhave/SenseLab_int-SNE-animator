gives instinct its mental power, once again in the sense of the capacity to surpass the given: it gives it its constitutive tilt toward the supernormal. Instinct always has a first degree of appetitive mentality, a hunger for the supernormal, however weighed down and laid low it may be with inherited corporeality and its penchant for sameness. In the case of instinct, corporeality comes in the inherited form of a genetic memory of the adaptive imperatives of past situations, triggered into reactivation by a present perception. It is the appetitive tendency of the supernormal to get in on the instinctive act that saves instinct from being the stereotyped reflex action it is too often reputed to be.
