The problem is that these comforts come with a price: normality; acquiescence to the already-expressed; the stifling of the supernormal tendency that immanently agitates and instinctively rouses all animals, human or otherwise, toward surpassing the dealt hand of the given. There is only one choice: renounce one’s animal instincts, or leave the comfort of home. There is only one way out: to deterritorialize oneself, to quit the human arena and reclaim animal existential territory. The necessity of the operation only makes it all the more intense. It only interlaces corporeality, the living out of the imperatives of the given situation, all the more closely with a forward-looking creative urge. It only laces corporeality all the more strongly with appetition. The becoming-animal of the human intensifies the mutual inclusion of corporeality and supernormal tendency, while reaffirming the latter’s primacy. At a critical point in life, it tips the pathic dependence on the home as given, and the family pathos of the homebound, into an intense movement of self-surpassing.
