“Life lurks in the interstices” (Whitehead 1978, 105). Not in the organism. Not in any given organization. “It is evident that according to this definition no single occasion can be called living. Life is the coordination of the mental spontaneities throughout the occasions of a society,” with society taken in the broadest sense of a grouping of activities entering into the making of an event (Whitehead 1967, 207).
