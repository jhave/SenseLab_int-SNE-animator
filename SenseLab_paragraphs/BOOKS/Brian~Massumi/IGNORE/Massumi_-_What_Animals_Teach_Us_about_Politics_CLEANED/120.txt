Intensity is the supreme value of this manner of politics, for the simple reason that it is experienced as a value in itself, a-body with the pure moodsigns of ludic expressionesqueness. One doesn’t “do” enthusiasm of the body, in the way we say in current usage that we “do” politics. Enthusiasm of the body is lived in and for itself, purely for the novel quality it gives to experience’s unfolding, and especially for its intensity, that little something extra. The excess element of an act’s intensity constitutes, in itself, an immediate surplus-value of life and, in its unfolding, an emergent surplusvalue of life yet-to-come—doubly worth it.
