Becoming produces nothing other than itself. [ . . . ] What is real is the becoming itself, the block of becoming, not the supposedly fixed terms through which that which becomes passes. Becoming can and should be qualified as becoming-animal even in the absence of a term that would be the animal become. (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 238)
The becoming passes between the human and the animal, in the margin of maneuver produced by placing their generic identities in suspense in such a way as to mutually include them in a state of heightened intensity—suspended animation. “Becoming-animal is an immobile voyage in place; it can only be lived and understood in intensity (cross thresholds of intensity)” (Deleuze and Guattari 1986, 35; trans. modified). The stylistic idiosyncrasies and bizarrely downplayed little-something-extras of Kafka’s writing make for a movement in place that understatedly outdoes itself, overspilling into an expressive becoming, crossing the threshold of the family into other regions of intensity. Of course, horror is not the only categorical affect that can provide the springboard for this kind of excessive movement. It could be any affect, depending on the context, and the particular way it makes the life of appetition unlivable. And the stylistic “excess” can be, as it is in Kafka’s case, an excessive sobriety, overspilling in a surplus of intensely felt simplicity. This minimalist excessiveness is perhaps the most propitious for becoming, because the autonomizing gesture of pure expression—leave the given framing of the scene, extract oneself from the imperatives of the context, suspend the terms structured into place and go elsewhere, shake loose and plunge headlong into an absolute deterritorialization without knowing in advance where it might lead—is all about strategic subtraction (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 6, 21, 279–280).
