Sociopathy, like schizophrenia in Deleuze and Guattariâ€™s sense, is an impersonal tendency. It is transindividual and transsituational after its own fashion. It is transindividual in that it refounds the juridicalpolitical order, and thus never affects one without affecting at least two. It is transsituational in that its state of exception is always a threshold between two such reorderings. Unlike the schizophrenic tendency, the sociopathic tendency is politico-pathological by nature, in all cases: both as trans-(individual/situational) and as personalized to fit the contours of an individual bodying. The individualization of this sovereign pathology comes about when the impersonal sociopathic tendency loses or renounces its transindividual foundational power, and turns monosituational. This occurs by dint of privatization, in withdrawal from the relational field of animality (and even its atrophied human proxy, the public sphere). Sociopathy, on both the individual and juridical-political levels, is the antilife tendency structuring human politics. It straddles the normopathic and psychotic tendencies, taking them both up in its sovereign movement. All regimes of sovereignty, not only fascism, are sociopathically mixed regimes straddling these levels and tendencies. Each invents its own dynamic resolution of their constitutive tension between the normopathic and psychotic poles.
