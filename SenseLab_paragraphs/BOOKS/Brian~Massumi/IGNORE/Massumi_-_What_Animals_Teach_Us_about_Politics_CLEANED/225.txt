What child plays animal once? Playing animal is a serious vocation. The enthusiasm of the body in play moves from situation to situation, play to repeatedly varied replay. The serial variations on tigritude compose a lived cartography of tigeresque corporeality. All manner of dependencies on the given, all manner of lived importance to which a tigeresque corporeality is susceptible, are surpassingly dramatized. All of the experienced affective compositions derive, by vital extrapolation, from the spectacle-spectator polarity of the primitive scene of animal perception that catalyzed the continuing activity. All of the variations on the affective complex experimented with were already mutually included in embryonic dynamic form in the unicity of the perceptual gesture that launched the play series.
