Sentimentality makes as if there were no way out but the already known alternatives. But there is always something that escapes containment, even if it cannot quite manage to bring itself to expression. There is a tendential counterpressure to containment. There is always something eddying in the microfissures of the human-political personality structure, readying to leak. That this is the case is so animally certain that it makes it possible to use sentimentality as a counterintuitive index of a becoming-in-waiting. There is a paradoxical positivity to sentiment as a sign of becoming. It is only too easy to denounce sentimentality (as was just done here). But perhaps denunciation is beside the point. Perhaps the real stakes are elsewhere. It is so easy to denounce sentimentality that the denunciation itself becomes a tired tune. It is all too easy to invest emotionally in denunciation. The problem is that denunciation is itself all too human.
