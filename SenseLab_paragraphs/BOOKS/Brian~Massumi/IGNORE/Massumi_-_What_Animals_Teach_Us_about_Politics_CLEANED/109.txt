The ludic element in play, -esqueness, comes with a transindividual transformation-in-place launching a movement of potential evolution that is fundamentally self-driven, in an autonomy of inventive expression. This is the principle of the primacy of the supernormal tendency in animal life. However, we saw that this transformation-in-place does not launch without the ensuing autonomy of expression being weighed down in a dependence on the already expressed: an obligatory taking on of the imperatives of the situation as given. The focus should not be on the reductive notion of a dialectic between play and combat, but rather on this reciprocal presupposition between the autonomy of expression on the one hand and the dependence on the already-expressed on the other: between lived abstraction and lived importance.
Abstraction lived through the autonomy of expression corresponds to the aesthetic, which in turn corresponds to the surpassing of the given in the conditional mode of the production of possibility. Lived importance, for its part, corresponds to the ethical: the anchoring of incorporated experience in the imperatives expressed in the already given.
