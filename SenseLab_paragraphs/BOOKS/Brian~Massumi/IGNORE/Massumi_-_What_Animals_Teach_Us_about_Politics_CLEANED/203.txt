What is inside the cage is not as completely contained as it first appeared. It is perhaps the greatest weapon of human politics to make it seem as if it were. Are not children who feel the horror feeling something vital through the horror? Something that is radically foreign to the structure of human politics, and to the undifferentiating too-human sentimentality into which the horror is meant to be anamorphically converted? Are they not feeling, intuitively, an imperceptible something extra left over after the human-political operation of affective conversion? Might this something extra be an unconvertible residue of animal sympathy? Belonging to another politics?
