That is what sympathy is. There is nothing more dynamic. There is nothing less mired in conformism. Nothing less sentimental. Nothing less projective and identificatory. The taking flight of play carries tigritude to altitudes where no tiger, or child, has ever set foot or paw: it has transported them together into pure expression. Pure expression is an existential territory where nothing ever sets foot, being purely lived abstraction. As pure animal expression, child’s play partakes of the same extra-existentializing movement as the literary game of becoming-animal described in Supplement 1. Becoming-written-animal is an extension of child’s play, which itself is an extension of animal corporeality as animated by the supernormal tendency of instinct. Writing raises the animal play of the human to a highest power, a supremely tensorial purity of expression: pure extra-being in becoming.
