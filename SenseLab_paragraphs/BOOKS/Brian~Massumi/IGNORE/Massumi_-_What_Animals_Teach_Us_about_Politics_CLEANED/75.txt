In short, there is a reciprocal potentialization of play by combat, and combat by play: a mutual inclusion of disparate potential. Potentials for variation that are infolded in play, unfold in fighting. This circuit of reciprocal potentialization is enabled, on both sides, by the creation of a mutually inclusive zone of indiscernibility that doubles the affirmation of their difference with an included middle. Play and combat overlap, without the distinction between them being lost. They come together, without fusing together, across any distance in time and space. They co-occur for change, without coalescingâ€”but with a crisscrossing in tone. Play, to the extent that it is successfully combat -esqueness, is potentially deadly serious. Combat, to the extent that it is necessarily improvisational, carries a ludic element. The dominant tone differs from one side to the other, but the -esque is on one side and the other, stretched supernormally between.
