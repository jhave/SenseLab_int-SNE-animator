It is crucial to bear in mind that this destructured figure of psychosis has nothing to do with the processual figure of schizophrenia as theorized by Deleuze and Guattari. Deleuze and Guattari’s schizophrenic is the figure of the absolute affirmation of the supernormal tendency, and has to do with the intensification of the animal movement of supernormal variation, and thus the production of ever more effective differentiations. The psychotic in the destructured sense is the human “rag” produced by the blockage of this desiring tendency by the imposition of undifferentiation as the only alternative to normopathy (Deleuze and Guattari 1983, 5, 19–20, 87–88). The psychotic in the pathological sense brings the undifferentiation that blocks supernormal desire to frenzied expression, pressurized by appetition’s slamming against an impasse. Instead of monumentalizing minimal difference, the psychotic turns it over at warp speed, returning it to indifference before it can transformatively unfold. Fascism is a mixed regime in which there is a mad oscillation between collective normopathy and the paranoia of collective psychosis.
