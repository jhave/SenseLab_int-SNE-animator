Categorical affect fills the gap that is opened by vitality affect and is extended into a reciprocal deterritorialization. It is the asymmetrically shared quality of experience bathing the evolving situation on all sides, through and through. It contributes the “what” the lived abstraction deterritorializes.

Categorical affect is the immediately felt determination of what life is actively about in the eventful complexity of the moment.
