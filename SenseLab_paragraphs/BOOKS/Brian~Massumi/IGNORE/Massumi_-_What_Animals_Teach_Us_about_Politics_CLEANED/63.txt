Evolution, of course, never escapes adaptive selection. It is not as blackand-white as that. But that is not really the question. The issue is the wellfoundedness of the neo-Darwinian principle according to which the only natural force for variation contributing to the genesis of forms of life is that of mutation. Mutation is purely accidental, as are the environmental changes that come to exert selective pressure on the variations mutations produce. As a concept, the accidental refers to extrinsic relations between discrete elements operating according to purely mechanistic laws that suffer a glitch: efficient causality temporarily out of service. Accidents occur punctually, by blind chance. Spontaneity, on the contrary, concerns qualitative variations occurring integrally as a block.
