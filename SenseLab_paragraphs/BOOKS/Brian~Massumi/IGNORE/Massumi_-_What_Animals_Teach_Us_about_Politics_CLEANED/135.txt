The ability to interpenetrate, to effectively mix without getting mixed up, is a defining characteristic of mentality according to Bergson. Tendencies are nothing other than the creative movement of the mental pole of nature, “creative” because from their dynamic interpenetrations emerge qualitative variations. Tendencies, in their “mental” movement, constitute subjectivities-without-a-subject: sheer doings, with no doer behind them—with nothing behind them but their own forward momentum.54 These self-propel, by nature, toward the surpassing of what is objectively given. Their dynamic form is nature’s in-the-making. Everywhere in nature it is a question of creative mixes of tendencies of varying degrees of self-driving power, corresponding to degrees of integral mentality or absolutely self-surveying consciousness. These degrees of consciousness are always enactive. They are thinking-doings. They are also at least germinally reflexive, in the manner evoked earlier in the discussion of absolute survey and primary consciousness. From the point of view of the affect with which they come, they are thinking-feelings a-doing.
