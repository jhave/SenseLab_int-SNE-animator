The failure of a ludic gesture in a play fight can be thought of in these terms. When the play gesture fails and the game turns into its analogue, it is because the weight of the categorical affect was too heavy. The imperative associated with it was felt with too much pathos, tripping up the supernormal tendency. The pull of corporeal truth of the situation was too strong. The gesture bodied forth too much in conformity with the felt imperatives of the arena of activity being played upon. The imperatives of the analog situation of fear say bite, truly. Play says nip, with style. When the play nip strikes too true, the game is dragged down by a bite that now denotes a bite. The -esqueness of the vitality affect is insufficient to maintain the suspension of combat. The commanding form of combat doesnâ€™t just modulate from within, it takes over. It obligates the event to itself. The tension between incorporation into an event and finessing a supernormal way through it tips too far toward the former. The play gap closes. Paradox collapses into earnestness, the power of the false into truthfulness. The minimal difference between what gestures denote and what they would denote is erased. It is a case of too much corporeality, and not enough mental power exerted toward giving a supernormal twist to the bodying. Too much lived importance (however misplaced), and not enough lived abstraction. Too unimaginative a bodying.
Although lived importance is a noncognitive understanding, too immediate in its nonoptional bracing into the event to constitute a reflection, as an understanding it still qualifies as an act of thought. It is thought at its lowest degree of creativity, anchored to a recognition of the given, which is to say keyed into the sameness of the present to the past. Lived abstraction, by contrast, is turned to the future, in an enactive thinking of the new. It is also a noncognitive understanding, but in future-oriented action.
