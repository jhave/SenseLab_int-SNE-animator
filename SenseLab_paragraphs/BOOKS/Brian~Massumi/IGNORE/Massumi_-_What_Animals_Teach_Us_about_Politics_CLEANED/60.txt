In its failure to pin instinct to the objective givenness of an efficient cause, the ethologist has led us, in spite of himself, to the natural upwelling of the qualitative and subjective as a factor in nature: to improvisational blocks of sensation indicative of a mental power to spontaneously surpass the given. There is nothing “behind” this tendency toward the supernormal that is an inescapable dimension of instinct. The supernormal exerts a positive force that, rather than impel from behind in the manner of a mechanistic force encountering resistance (even minimized by welloiled gears), positively pulls from ahead. The supernormal tendency is an attractive force that pulls experience forward, toward its own limit—that of the spontaneous passion for the mutual inclusion of the diverse, under integral transformation.
