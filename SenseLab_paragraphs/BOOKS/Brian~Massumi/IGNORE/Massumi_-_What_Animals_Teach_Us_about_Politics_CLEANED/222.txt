There is no resemblance between the form of a tigeresquely selfperforming child and the visible, corporeal form of a tiger. The child does not receive and reproduce a visible image of the tiger. Rather, tigritude visionarily animates the childâ€™s bodying, in the direction of a differencing. It is precisely this process that is definitive of the image. There is no such thing as a passive image. There is no such thing as an image privately received in the interiority of a subject. All images are active, and their activity plays out situationally, which is to say relationally. The tigeresque roars forth as the commanding form of this situation of play. It carries analog potential as opposed to conformal power. Analog potential is a power of integrally linked variation; of differential mutual inclusion. The child does not produce a conformal correspondence between its own corporeal form and that of its tiger analogue. It enthusiastically lends its own corporeality to ludic in-forming by the commanding form of tigritude, under visionary deformation and variation.
