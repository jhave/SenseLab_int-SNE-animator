It is not that an animal has a consciousness of the immanent in-between that is the absolute survey of sympathy. Rather, this immanent in-between is consciousness. Primary consciousness is the being of a first degree of mentality: an enactive being of relation, for supernormal twisting. Absolute survey is the field of consciousness, in that the field of consciousness is “coextensive with life” (Bergson 1998, 186) under the propulsion of its self-driving tendency to bring itself to new active expression. The mode of existence of sympathy is the being of the thinking-doing of life. It must be thought of as a verb rather than a substantive, because in the logic of mutual inclusion there is nothing “behind” activity. There are only interlacing modes of activity differentiating themselves as aspects or sides of the same event.
