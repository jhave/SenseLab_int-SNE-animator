Writing, according to Deleuze and Guattari, has the expressive capacity to unleash a “particle of becoming”: an integral, nondecomposable dramatization of the movement toward the supernormal. The deterritorializing gesture of the becoming-animal of the human proceeds by blocks, just like the peck of the herring gull chick. The affects involved in the dramatization, both vitality and categorical, concern sequences of potential actions that are enactively enveloped in the primary consciousness of the domains of thinking-doing in play. It is useful to recall the basic definition of affect that Deleuze and Guattari adopt from Spinoza: “the capacity to affect and be affected” (Deleuze 1988a, 123–124). The potential actions invoked through the dramatization bundle sets of capacities to affect and be affected. These bundles unwind as tendencies. The tendencies interpenetrate, in reciprocal immanence. Like the blocks of sensation “hallucinated” by the herring gull, these affective tendential bundles are composed of “internal relations.” The tendencies coactivate in intensity, but clamor, in resonance and interference, in competition and symbiosis, to unfold extensively, and not in any normal way.
