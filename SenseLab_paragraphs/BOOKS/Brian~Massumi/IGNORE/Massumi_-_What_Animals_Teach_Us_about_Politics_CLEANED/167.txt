The Anomal is marked by a special quality that serves as an index to its supernormality: an exemplary -esqueness epitomizing the whole bundle of -esque-potential the exemplary animal envelops in its movements. In Moby Dick, it is the whiteness of the whale: the extranatural whiteness exciting an equally unnatural passion in the whale’s written human counterpart that matches his own intensity, in counterpoint. Ahab is induced into an intensive play of becoming by the whiteness of the whale—and with him, the reader, in transindividual contagion. What imperatives of escape have conditioned this line of flight? When the becoming daisy-chains, from writer to written figure to reader of the writing, do the imperatives and the passion to deterritorialize remain the same, or do they also undergo continual variation? It is quite certainly the latter. The becoming becomes across the series. This makes it impossible to understand becomings in writing in terms of reception theory. Nothing in particular is transmitted. Something singular is recatalyzed. It is not a communication, it is an event series.
