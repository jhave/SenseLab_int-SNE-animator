Of course, the option is still out there to return to a pre-post-cascade post-, from an earlier age when it seemed not entirely whimsical that consciousness could be decoupled from life, and consciousness alone retained (or at least its poor unintuitive cousin, intelligence). This is the old dream of artificial intelligence, as grossly prefigured in the 1950s science fiction image of the brain in the vat. But if it is considered that the human becomes all the more animal the farther it pushes its mental power, that it becomes all the more vital the more it lives abstraction, then the more difficult it becomes to imagine untying the knot of mutual inclusion joining animality, life, and consciousness. It is perhaps not out of the question that one day this mutual inclusion itself could be machined. Nature, after all, is overfull of artifice. In fact, there is nothing more effectively and paradoxically artificial than nature under the propulsion of its constitutive tendency toward the supernormal.
