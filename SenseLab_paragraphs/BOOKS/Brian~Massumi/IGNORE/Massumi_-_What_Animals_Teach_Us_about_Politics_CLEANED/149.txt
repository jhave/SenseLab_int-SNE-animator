The animal politics approach advanced here inverts the critique. Not in the sense, of course, of affirming the human projection of its own characteristics on the animal. Quite the opposite, it envelops the human in an integrated animo-centrism in which it loses its a priori dominance without, however, either its difference or those of its animal peers being blurred or erased. It calls on the human to become animal, not on animals to renounce vital powers long wrongly assumed to be the sole province of the human.
