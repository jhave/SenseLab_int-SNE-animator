When enthusiasm of the body comes to be emotionally contained, it becomes pressurized by the containment. It can then only express itself distortedly. It expresses not as an improvisational movement of selfsurpassing-in-becoming but rather a (most often embarrassingly clich√©d) simply being emotionally out of control (mistaken for animal passion). Sentimentality cuts itself off even from this histrionic escape hatch, constrained to the temperate median degrees of the thermometer of human-emotional histrionics. On that human midscale of emotion, animal sympathy is translated into its faded human analogue: empathy. The epitome of this translation is found in melodrama (the sorrow and the pity).
