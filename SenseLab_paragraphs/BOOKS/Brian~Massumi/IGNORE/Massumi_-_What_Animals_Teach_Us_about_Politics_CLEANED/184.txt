Agamben convincingly demonstrates that every human political gesture logically includes this indifferent ground in its structural exclusions, in one sterilely paradoxical way or another, usually occulted. But when this included exclusion is itself given a figure, it is in the paradoxical form of the exception that founds the rule, reconstituting the rule in the act of suspending it. This is the very definition of Agambenian sovereignty. This paradoxical act of sovereignty still merits being called “sterile,” even though it is constitutive. For it does not invent; it refounds. It does not surpass the given; it regives it. It reimparts essentially the same structure. “The exception that defines the structure of sovereignty . . . creat[es] and defin[es] the very space in which the juridico-political order can have validity” (Agamben 1995, 18–19). It’s all about formally putting back into place the premises of human politics: redouble-framing them, for another round.
