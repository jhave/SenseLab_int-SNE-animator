Sentimentality “makes as if ” . . . (as if there were no way out but the already known alternative). Lived cartography never makes “as if,” understood in the imitative sense.10 Imitation is identification projecting back onto its source, overlaying the form of the other on the viewer. It is a return overlay upon the source from which the projective identification discussed above emanates. In both cases, the zone of identificatory indifference serves as a medium for conveying a sameness of form. In the zoo visit, the anthro-form anamorphoses onto the animal. In the imitation, the movement goes in the opposite direction. It is the form of the observed animal that anamorphoses onto the human viewer, wallpapering it with an animal motif. This is a secondary reprojection—a distorted retrojection— conditioned by a prior ana-anthropomorphizing projection. Only humans imitate animals. Even in the most intimate and humanly ordered situations in which animals frequent humans, in the role of companion animals or in animal husbandry, they never imitate the human. They relate to them. In this sense, the identification only goes one way.
