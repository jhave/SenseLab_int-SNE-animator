Thus the ethico-aesthetic paradigm calls for a politics of relation. A second criterion of evaluation flows from this, closely linked to the criterion of antipathic intensity: that which carries the mutual inclusion of the disparate and the differing to a higher power is to be affirmed. This involves -esquing gestures that produce greater degrees of copossibility, more embracing immanent vistas of absolute survey unfoldable into proliferations of variation.
