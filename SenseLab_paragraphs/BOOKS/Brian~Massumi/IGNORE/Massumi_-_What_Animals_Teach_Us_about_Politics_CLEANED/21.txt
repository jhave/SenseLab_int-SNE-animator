Recent investigations with a similar emphasis on creativity in nature have taken as their point of departure the artfulness of animal courtship rituals. This starting point focuses the discussion on sexual selection. For reasons that will become clear, this is not the path that will be taken here. Sexual selection, as analyzed by Elizabeth Grosz (2008), successfully calls into question the neo-Darwinian doctrine that chance mutation is the only source of life’s variation, loosening morphogenesis—the genesis of forms of life—from the vice grip of blind chance. It also calls into question the associated doctrine that the only principle of selection operative in evolution is adaptation to external circumstance (Grosz 2011, pt. 3, ch. 8). In the arena of animal courtship, selection bears directly on qualities of lived experience. The aim is at creativity, rather than adaptive conformity to the constraints of given circumstance. Sexual selection expresses an inventive animal exuberance attaching to qualities of life, with no direct use-value or survival value. As Darwin himself pointed out (1871, 63–64), the excesses of sexual selection can only be described as an expression of a “sense of beauty” ( just ask a peahen). The present account agrees on all these points. The basic reason it will not take sexual selection as its point of departure is that doing so leaves by the wayside the majority of life-forms populating the earth. It leapfrogs over more “primitive,” less ostentatiously coupling creatures, not to mention “lower” animals that persist in multiplying asexually.
