Darwin himself said as much when he sang the praises of the improvisational prowess of his beloved earthworms, to whom he dedicated a lengthy treatise. The operation of instinct, he writes, cannot be equated to “a simple reflex action” as if the animal “were an automaton” (Darwin 1890, 24).10 The proof is that the same stimulus doesn’t lead to the same effect, depending on chance variations in the situation. In other words, instinct is sensitive to the relations between the particular elements composing the lived situation. Its action varies with the singularity of that situation. All earthworms instinctively plug the opening of their burrows, but the way they ensure this invariable instinctive function varies, depending on the materials available, the form in which they come, and their placement and configuration. “If worms acted solely through instinct [in the sense of ] an unvarying inherited impulse, they would all [plug their burrows] in the same manner” (1890, 64–65). On the contrary, “we see an individual profiting from its individual experience” (95) to improvise a solution that is adapted, not to the generality of the situation, but to its singularity. This capacity, Darwin remarks, shows evidence of “mental power” (25, 34–35): a power of abstraction.
