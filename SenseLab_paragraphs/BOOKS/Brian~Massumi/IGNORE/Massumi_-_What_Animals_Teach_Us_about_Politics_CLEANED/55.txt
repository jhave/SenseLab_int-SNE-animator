The improvisational expressivity of instinct that gives it the integral power to generate surplus-value of life must be recognized as an aboriginal, autonomous mode of activity, irreducible to the functional modes that capture it. The difference, however minimal it may be, between functionality and expressivity, between instrumentality and aesthetic activity, is always and everywhere in force. Activity in its expressive dimension is by nature in excess over the normalized functions of the general forms of activity already adapted to survival. Instinct, in its aspect of expressive activity, has an inborn tendency to surpass the normal, by dint of enthusiasm of the body. It is animated by an immanent impetus toward the supernormal.
