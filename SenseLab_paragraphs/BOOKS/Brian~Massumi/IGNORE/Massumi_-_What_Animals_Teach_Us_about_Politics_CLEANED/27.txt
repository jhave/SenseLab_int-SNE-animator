The suspension exerts its own force: a force of induction. When I make the kind of gesture that places me in the register of play, you are immediately taken there as well. My gesture transports you with me into a different arena of activity than the one we were just in. You are inducted into play with me. In a single gesture, two individuals are swept up together and move in tandem to a register of existence where what matters is no longer what one does, but what one does stands-for.
