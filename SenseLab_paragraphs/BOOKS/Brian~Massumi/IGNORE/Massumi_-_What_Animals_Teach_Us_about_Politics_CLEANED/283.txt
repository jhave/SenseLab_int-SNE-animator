6. It is Nietzsche’s philosophy of animality, as analyzed by Vanessa Lemm (2009), that is closest to the present account. Nietzsche embraces instinct across a natureculture / human-animal continuum, is exemplarily sensitive to larval subjects, centrally develops the concept of subjectivities-without-a-subject (deeds with no doers behind them), refuses to confine life to the organic or assign a dividing line between it and matter, recognizes the centrality of affect, rethinks politics as a function of animality, and consummately plays language. Lemm correctly interprets Nietzsche’s “overman” not as an overcoming of nature, but as a reinvention of nature enabling the human to overcome itself. “In the Nietzschean term ‘overhuman,’ the prefix ‘over-’ is used neither to separate the human from the animal, nor to set one above the other, but to establish just enough distance [the necessary minimal difference] so as to open up the space for an agonistic encounter” (Lemm 2009, 21). Agonistic: combatesque. Nietzsche’s animal philosophy is an inversion of the posthuman paradigm. For Nietzsche, “nature uses the human as a means toward its own completion rather than the other way around” (Lemm 2009, 3).
