Bateson discusses at length the paradoxical nature of the abstraction effected in play. He sees it as an instance of the Epimenides paradox made famous by Bertrand Russell, which consists in “a negative statement containing an implicit negative metastatement” (180). The gestural statement “this is not a bite” contains the implicit metastatement “these actions do not denote what they would denote.” But at the same time, if it was so simple a case as the actions not denoting what they would denote, they would not have to deny their denoting. The play statement is one that says what it denies, and denies what it says. It is logically undecidable. Of course, a wolf cub doesn’t say anything, strictly speaking. It says in doing. It acts. Its “statement” and “metastatement” are an enacted paradox, one with the simplicity of a single gesture. In the unicity of the gesture, two logics are gathered together in one metacommunication, charging the situation with possibilities that surpass it. The ludic gesture embodies this complexity. Its abstraction is embodied thought. Animal play activates paradox. It mobilizes and dramatizes it. The dramatization takes what from the point of view of traditional logic would be nothing more than its own implosion and actually does it. This makes it an effective paradox. Animal metacommunication is efficacious. It does, and induces doing, flush with its performance, directly, in the immediacy of its gestures’ execution. In animal play, logical undecidability takes on an efficacy that is as direct as it is paradoxical.
