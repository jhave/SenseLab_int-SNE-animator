When they come together, they are performatively fused without becoming confused. This means that they can remix, when it occurs to them to come performatively together again. Thus in the logic of mutual inclusion, instinct and intuition can be said to be on the same continuum, separated only by degrees (as when it was said that instinct is lived intuition at the first degree of mentality), and they can be said to mix, across a difference in kind (as when it was said that instinct is pragmatically enabled by intuition). In the logic of mutual inclusion, difference of degree and difference in kind are actively inseparable, two sides of the same processual coin. The continuum on which instinct and intuition differ by degrees is that of animal bodying. The remix in which they come-together-again across their difference in kind recurs punctually in animal bodyingâ€™s every gestured event.
