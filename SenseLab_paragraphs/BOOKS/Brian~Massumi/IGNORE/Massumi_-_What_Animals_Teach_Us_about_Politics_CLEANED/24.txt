Bateson’s discussion of animal play revolves around difference. This is the best starting point for thinking the animal continuum, which is nothing other than a spectrum of continual variation—a changing field of reciprocally presupposing differencings, complexly imbricated with one another all along the line. In the course of the following discussion, a concept will be slowly constructed for this reciprocal imbrication of differences: mutual inclusion. But for the moment, the question at hand is how difference comes into play.
