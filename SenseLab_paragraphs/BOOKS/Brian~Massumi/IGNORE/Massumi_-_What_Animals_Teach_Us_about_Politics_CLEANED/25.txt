Two animals who abandon themselves to play, for example, a play fight, perform acts that “are similar to but not the same as those of combat” (Bateson 1972, 179). Each ludic gesture envelops a difference in a display of similarity. This could be taken as a definition of analogy. Playing doesn’t involve producing a perfect resemblance between two acts belonging to different orders. It’s not about making “as if ” one were the other, in the sense of making one pass for the other. The play gesture is analogous because what is in play is not the Same. The play gesture holds the analog activities apart by signaling a minimal difference, in exactly the same act in which it brings them together. It brings acts belonging to different arenas together in their difference. What is played upon is the noncoincidence. The ludic gesture envelops that disparity in its own execution. This is precisely what makes it play. If a gesture in a play fight were the same as its analogue in combat, the play would immediately turn into a fight. A ludic gesture must signal its belonging to the arena of play if it is to avoid falling out of it. If, for example, two wolf cubs in a play fight perform their moves with too much similarity to fighting, and not enough in analogy with it, the partners will become adversaries on the spot, with the attendant risk of potentially serious injury. A ludic gesture must signal, in its manner of execution: “this is a game.”
