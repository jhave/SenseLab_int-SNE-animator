In language, the corresponding zone of indiscernibility is verbal. As verbal, it lends itself to a purely logical definition, in terms of Russellâ€™s paradox, which is treated at length by Bateson. This paradox revolves around the impossibility of a class being a member of itself (the Epimenides paradox, or the paradox of the Cretan liar).23 The map that coincides with the territory is another version of the same enigma. The zone of indiscernibility of play actively exemplifies this kind of paradox. In its enactive cartography, the composition of the map and the composition of the territory effectively coincide, in gesture. The integrally enactive and fully embodied nature of this enthusiastically supernormal cartography demands a definition in terms other than purely logical.
