5. Animal politics is also obliged to distance itself from the concept of agency. The transindividuality of the process of vital becoming complicates the question of agency. The problem was signaled earlier: no efficient cause can be isolated behind the movement of experience’s self-surpassing. This self-driving movement triggers itself, in an irreducibly relational manner. It is more a question of catalysis than of linear causality. The catalysis is experiential: directly lived, on a qualitative register, in the transindividual between of absolute survey. Its lived, qualitative nature obliged us to call it “subjective,” in spite of its strangeness with respect to the usual understandings of the word, and to call its inventive potential to surpass the given a “mental power,” even though it is in the tightest of processual embraces with corporeality. It is crucial to register this strangeness. Particularly when it comes to what is traditionally considered to be the necessary complement of the subject—the object. The eventful processual subjectivity at issue here has no object as its structural complement. It only has things to come, and these are less “things” than processual supplements—surplusvalues of life. Most of all, there should be no illusions that the mental power of processual subjectivity resides in a “mind” (individual or collective). It is a subjectivity not only without an efficient cause behind it, but without a subject behind it either. The mental power of this processual subjectivity-without-a-subject may be considered spiritual, if by that is simply meant intensely, relationally enlivening. It makes for spirited acts, with which it absolutely coincides.
