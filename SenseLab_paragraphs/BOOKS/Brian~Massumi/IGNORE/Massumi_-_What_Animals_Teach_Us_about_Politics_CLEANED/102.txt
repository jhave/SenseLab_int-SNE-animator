As in the present account of animality, Bergson emphasizes that the operations of instinct are transindividual, and that they are not reducible to an accumulation of accidental variations: “The effort by which a species modifies its instinct, and modifies itself as well [ . . . ] does not depend solely on the initiative of individuals, although individuals collaborate in it, and it is not purely accidental” (Bergson 1998, 170–171). The transindividuality of instinct is easy to see. It is evident that a tracing of the play partner’s coactivity is included in negative outline in the -esqueness of the ludic gesture. The ludic gesture is impotent unless it captures the other’s attention. In the way it captures attention, the gesture sketches the anticipatory outline of the partner’s coming countermoves. The ludic gesture is a sign of active potential not only in the animal who executes it, but also in the other, whose own appetition joins forces with that of the author of the gesture, with all the immediacy of the transformation-inplace the gesture effects. The ludic gesture immediately implicates at least two, at a distance, and in their individual differences and differing roles, in an instantaneous back-and-forth of dynamic point and counterpoint. In keeping with the logic of mutual inclusion, one can assign a difference in kind to intuition and sympathy, as two sides or qualitatively different aspects of this joint activity of transindividual mutual inclusion. Intuition is everything that goes into “lowering the barriers of space” to effect this dynamic mutual inclusion (Bergson 1998, 177; trans. modified). Sympathy is the transindividual becoming brought into being by intuition’s acting out. Sympathy is the mode of existence of the included middle.
