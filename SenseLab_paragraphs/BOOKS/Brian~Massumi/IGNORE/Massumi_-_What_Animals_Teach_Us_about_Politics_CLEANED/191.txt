Bateson himself does not touch on the third politico-pathological component: the keystone of sovereign exception. But it is not difficult to give it a name in line with the two diagnoses just presented: sociopathy. Agambenian sovereignty is the constitutive sociopathy of human politics. Call sociopathic any mechanism that works to refound the structure of human politics in such a way as to reimpart more normopathy and psychosis, in their infernally complementary antibecoming. The sociopathy of sovereignty is closely related to fascism, without being reducible to it.
