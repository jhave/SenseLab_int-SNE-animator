The movement toward the determination of new forms, or variations on existing forms, passes tendentially through the situation, toward a new and different situation that will succeed it. This potentially involves a passage from one arena of activity to another. The movement of in-formation is by nature transsituational. To the extent that the in-formational process repeats given forms or formal patterns inherited from the past, it is only because the transsituational movement was able to regenerate the previous form of the given by immanent means, drawing on its own processual resources. What is thought of as the conformal application of a preexisting rule is actually, processually speaking, a becoming-limited to the narrow parameters set by an inherited imperative to resprout the forms of the past. Coding, by this view, is a limitative lowest degree of supernormal tending. Whitehead explains that what facilitates this code-bearing conformation to the past (what in this essay has been analyzed as a dependence on or acquiescence to the given) is not the staying in place of already determined forms, and not even their transmission as ready-mades, but rather germs of in-formation, embryonic form-finders that have been planted in the territory, and are repeatedly replanted by mechanisms of reuptake immanent to each successive situation, carried by the transsituational tendencies passing through them like an infection. These are genetic factors that remain in the catalytic mix, infectiously resprouting conformal form from a foothold immanent to the processual movement (Whitehead 1967, 203â€“204). They operate on what Deleuze and Guattari would characterize as the micropolitical level (1987, 196, 199, 213, 216, 292; Massumi 2009).
