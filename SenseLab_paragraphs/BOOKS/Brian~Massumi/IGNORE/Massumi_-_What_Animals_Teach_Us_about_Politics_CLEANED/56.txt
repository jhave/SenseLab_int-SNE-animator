Niko Tinbergen’s pioneering studies of instinct, which helped lay the foundations of the discipline of ethology, were not unscathed by this. Early on, Tinbergen noted a pronounced tendency of instinctive activity to favor what he called “supernormal stimuli” (1951, 44–47). Taking as his starting point the standard model of instinct as stimulus-response operating strictly by reflex, Tinbergen decided to inquire into which particular properties of given instinctual stimuli were functioning as the triggers. For example, in the herring gull a red spot on the female’s bill serves under normal conditions as the trigger for feeding (Tinbergen and Perdeck, 1950). The spot attracts the peck of the chick, which stimulates the adult to regurgitate the menu. In order to study exactly which perceptual quality constituted the trigger, Tinbergen set about constructing a series of decoy bills presenting a range of variable characteristics. His goal was to isolate the precise properties essential to the instinctive behavior. In order to understand the behavior’s parameters, he extended the range of variation presented well “beyond the limits of the normal object” (Tinbergen 1965, 68). To his great surprise, he was unable to isolate any particular properties he could point to as essential. Even a gray spot, in certain configurations, could do the trick. Even more surprisingly, Tinbergen found to his consternation that among the decoys producing the most enthusiastic response on the part of the chick were those that least resembled the normal form of the female herring gull’s bill. The young gull’s enthusiasm of the body pressed ardently beyond the normal.
