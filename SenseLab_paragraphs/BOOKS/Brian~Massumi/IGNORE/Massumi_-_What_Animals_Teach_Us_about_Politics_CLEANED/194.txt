The operation of identificatory overlay is achieved through projection. Only projected emotions are bendable enough to contort their way through the bars, passing over the segregation that its own operation presupposes. If psychosis means falling into a zone of undifferentiation, then identificatory projection qualifies as a variant degree of it. As a category confusion, it is on the psychotic spectrum, but at one end of it, in closest proximity to the normopathic, in whose normative gendering and narrative genres it happily partakes. The operation of identificatory projection injects a controlled dose of parapsychotic histrionics into the institution of the zoo. Straddling the normopathic and the psychotic after its own fashion, it applies a sentimental finish to the sociopathic layering specific to the zoo.
