To do justice to the intensity of this gesture of becoming-animal, it is necessary once again to factor in the difference between vitality affect—in its relation to play, where it is one with the enthusiasm of the body expressing life’s creative dynamism—and categorical affect. Every ludic gesture invokes the salient categorical affect normally attaching to the analog situation. For play-fighting wolf cubs it is fear. For Gregor, in Kafka’s The Metamorphosis, it is horror. Horror is fear laced with pathos. The necessity of the operation comes from the horrific context of animal desire being forced into the limitative frame of the Oedipal triangle. The ludic gesture of becoming-animal has no choice but to dramatize the horror, which perfuses every cranny of the home situation. Horror is the affective key in which the situational imperatives demand acquiescence. The way out is letting oneself be swept up all the more horrifically intensely in the enthusiasm of the body of vitality affect.
