The play statement “this is a game,” Bateson explains, is far from a simple act of designation. It is the staging of a paradox. A wolf cub who bites its litter mate in play “says,” in the manner in which it bites, “this is not a bite.” The play bite, Bateson says, actively “stands for” another action (180), at the same time as it puts the context in which that action finds its practical force and normal function in suspense. The play bite that says it is not a bite has the value of the analogous action without its force or function. The wolf cub says through his teeth: “this is not a bite; this is not a fight; this is a game; I am hereby placing myself on a different register of existence, which nevertheless stands for its suspended analogue.”
