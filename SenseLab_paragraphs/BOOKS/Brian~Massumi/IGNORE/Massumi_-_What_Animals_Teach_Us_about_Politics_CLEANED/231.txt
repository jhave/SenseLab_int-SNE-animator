What does the animal play of the human bring to zoo-ology, or to the thinking of human politics? It contributes the idea that even spectaclespectator complexes—of which perception itself is the limit case—are germinally in-formed by at least eddies of incipient becoming. And that these stirrings can be affirmed. And that in affirming them, the human assumes its animality. This is even true of the spectacle-spectator complexes of the popular media and the entertainment industries, as well as that, more abject, of the zoo. How many children have come home from the zoo in full-fledged tigritude? Or serpentesque self-survey? In tarantulesque takeoff ? Becomings-animal claw, bite, and sting away at the situations of normopathic and sociopathic life, in a way that only gestures that do not denote what they would denote are capable.
