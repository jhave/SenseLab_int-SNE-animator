The pragmatic necessity requires each project of metamodelization to imagine for itself what a philosophical laboratory adequate to its aims could be. Every metamodelization needs to construct a philosophical laboratory. For that it needs techniques. If ethico-aesthetic politics is a politics of relation, if its metaconceptual constructions bear on belonging, then the necessary techniques can be nothing other than live techniques of abstractive relation: relational techniques of lived abstraction.57 The metamodelization of animal politics must open its own operations to the supernormal tendency to surpass the given with which it is prioritarily concerned. A mental power to surpass the given is a definition of speculation. The form of pragmatism at issue here is speculative pragmatism. A warning: there are many forms of speculative thought and pragmatism that are not tendential, creative, or concerned with developing the singular logic of mutual inclusion (buyer beware).
