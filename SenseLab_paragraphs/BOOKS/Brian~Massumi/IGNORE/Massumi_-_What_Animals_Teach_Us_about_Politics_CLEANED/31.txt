Second, the difference that the gesture’s abstraction puts into play is in a particular mode: that of the conditional. “These actions do not denote what those actions for which they stand would denote.” The ludic gesture infuses the situation with conditional reality. The analog actions of the played-upon arena of activity, that of combat, are made present in the mode of possibility. The currently occurring action finds itself inhabited by actions belonging to a different existential arena, whose actions are effectively felt to be present, but in potential, held in suspense. Even though held in suspense, they exercise a power. They orient the actions of the game’s unfolding by analogy, providing them with a guiding logic. They give the game what Susanne Langer calls its “commanding form” or formative “matrix” (1953, 122–123). The gestures of combat in-form the game: modulate it from within. At the same time, they themselves are slightly deformed by the stylism of the play and its own ludic logic. It is under the effect of this deformation that the blows of combat transmute into moves in a game.
Where the immanent modulation and stylistic deformation overlap— that is to say, in the gesture itself—the arena of combat and that of play enter into a zone of indiscernibility, without their difference being erased. The logics of fighting and play embrace each other, in their difference. They overlap in their shared gesture, the simplicity of which as a single act constitutes their zone of indiscernibility. They overlap in the unicity of the performance, without the distinction between them being lost. They are performatively fused, without becoming confused. They come together without melding together, co-occurring without coalescing. The zone of indiscernibility is not a making indifferent. On the contrary, it is where differences come actively together.
