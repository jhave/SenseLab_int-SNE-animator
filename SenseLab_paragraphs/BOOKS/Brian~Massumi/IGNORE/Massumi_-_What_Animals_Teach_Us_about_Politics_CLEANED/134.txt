Tendencies are differentiated by the poles between which their vector stretches: they are defined by their limits. The logic of mutual inclusion does not prioritarily concern itself with forms, or objects, or even subjects. Tendency is what feeds it. It is in the interlacing of tendential movements that forms, objects, and subjects are constituted, in perpetual emergence and continual variation. As Bergson emphasizes, tendencies are not distinguished from each other in the mutually exclusive manner that forms, objects, and subjects distinguish themselves. Tendencies can combine forces without mutually excluding each other. In fact, it is their vocation to mix. Even though they are logically distinguishable by their polarity and orientation, they never occur naturally alone. Every situation always activates a mix of them. In every situation, they co-occur without coalescing. They resonate or interfere with each other, stunt or prolong each other, sap or boost each other, capture each other or enter into mutually beneficial symbiosis. In Bergson’s vocabulary, they “interpenetrate” in a zone of indiscernibility, all the while remaining logically distinct when considered as vectors moving through that zone.
