To pursue animal politics, it is not required to refrain from denouncing spectacle-spectator complexes and the oppressive structure they enframe. Nor is it indicated to cease analyzing forms of power, whether of the media or in the political arena in its traditional understanding. But what is called for is not being content with denunciation or analysis. Under the spectacle . . . porcupinetude. There are always, everywhere, incipient supernormal explorations to germinate, expressions to finesse with animal -esqueness, quills to throw, escape hatches to open analogically, situations to repolarize, tensors to extrapolate, unheard-of potentialities to invent, life contents to reinvent, all through the reinvigorating gestures of a lived cartography. There is, everywhere, always something to be done politically. For there is nowhere without corporeality and its dependence on the given. The imperatives of already expressed importance are everywhere life goes. Everywhere that inheritance is felt to be stifling, everywhere the already-expressed speaks in too imperative a tone, everywhere a corporeality hits against a structural impasse in its efforts to reinvigorate itself, everywhere sentimentality emotionally contains affect, there is work to be done replaying the situation, and play to be reworked out enactively-cartographically.
Zoo-ology is an invitation to animal voyage. If you are still not convinced of the pertinence of such expressly superfluous voyages of deterritorialization, whose seriousness is always ahead of them, then consider that if there are universals of human existence, the childlike propensity to play animal is surely at the top of the list.
