Simondon makes a similar point, calling the animal an “inchoate plant” and arguing that there are no “substantial differences” enabling categorical distinctions between kingdoms, genuses, and species (Combes 2013, 22– 23). From this point of view, the “animal continuum” could also be called the “plant continuum,” depending on which middle one chooses to begin from, and for which conceptually constructive strategic reasons, leading to which definitions and distinctions, to what effect. The choice is not really arbitrary. It is thoroughly pragmatic. The choice of middle will have consequences for how all of the philosophical concepts involved play out, in their relations with each other. Abductively anticipating these, modulating them in advance, constitutes the speculative element. The coherence of the conceptual continuum needs to be integrally reinvented at every rebeginning, so that philosophy itself is in continual emergent variation.
