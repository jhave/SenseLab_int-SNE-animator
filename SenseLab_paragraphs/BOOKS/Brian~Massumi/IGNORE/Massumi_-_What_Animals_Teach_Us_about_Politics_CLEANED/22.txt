The focus will instead be on animal play, working in particular from Gregory Bateson’s famous essay on the topic (Bateson 1972). Play, it is true, comes into its own as an independent arena of activity among “higher” animals of a certain level of complexity, in particular among mammals.4 But as we will see, understanding the flourishing of play at that level necessitates theorizing wellsprings of sympathy and creativity, the qualitative and even the subjective, everywhere on the continuum of animal life. The very nature of instinct—and thus of animality itself—must be rethought as a consequence.
This project requires replacing the human on the animal continuum. This must be done in a way that does not erase what is different about the human, but respects that difference while bringing it to new expression on the continuum: immanent to animality. Expressing the singular belonging of the human to the animal continuum has political implications, as do all questions of belonging. The ultimate stakes of this project are political: to investigate what lessons might be learned by playing animality in this way about our usual, all-too-human ways of working the political. The hope is that in the course of the investigation we might move beyond our anthropomorphism as regards ourselves: our image of ourselves as humanly standing apart from other animals; our inveterate vanity regarding our assumed species identity, based on the specious grounds of our sole proprietorship of language, thought, and creativity. We will see what the birds and the beasts have instinctively to say about this.
