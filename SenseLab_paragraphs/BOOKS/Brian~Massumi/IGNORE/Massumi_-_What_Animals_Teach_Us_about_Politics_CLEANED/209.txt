The primary consciousness that comes with sympathy is a relational, situational consciousness. This means, once again, that it is nonlocalizable. It is not reducible to the consciousness of an individual. It is the reciprocal partaking of the individuals involved in the consciousness of the situation. It is the differential consciousness of the integrality of the situation: the dynamic unity of its action as mutually including the diverse. It is the intuitive understanding of what does not affect one without affecting the other. In other words, it is the affective consciousness of the situation’s dynamism, registering the “what” is thematically at stake in it with the “how” of the theme’s tendential unfolding, including both the genericness of the situation and its potential inflection toward supernormal evolution.
