Following this movement, one never arrives at the apocalyptic finality of a posthuman age, categorically beyond the human pale. Instead, one finds oneself always already more-than-human: mutually included in the integral animal continuum as it follows its natural path in the direction of its immanent self-surpassing. The more-than-human: the included middle of becoming-animal, always-already in process, in playful pilgrim’s progress to its own horizon.1 To quote Judith Butler, writing from a very different philosophical line but one that intersects on this point: “Both animality and life constitute and exceed whatever we call human. The point is not to find the right typology, but to understand where typological thinking falls apart” (Butler and Athanasiou 2013, 35). Where the typological thinking of category separations falls apart, there the need—and the opportunity— will be found to undertake the positive project of constructing a logic of differential mutual inclusion of modes of existence, and of ages of nature, that is more to the animal-political point.
