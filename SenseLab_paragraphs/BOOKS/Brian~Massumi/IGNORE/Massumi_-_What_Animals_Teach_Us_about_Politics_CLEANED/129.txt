The micropolitical is the dimension of events in which supernormal tendencies of decoding and deterritorialization make themselves excessively felt. The micropolitical is not the opposite of the macropolitical. It is its processual correlate. It makes no more sense to speak of the micropolitical outside its mutual inclusion with the macropolitical—the level of codes and general rules and normative ethics—than it does to separate lived abstraction from corporeality, or categorical affect from vitality affect. But it is also crucial to bear in mind that the mutual inclusion of the microand macropolitical, like all mutual inclusions, is not just differential but asymmetrical. There is a creative excess of intensity on the side of the micropolitical. The micropolitical is about vital gesture, supernormally oriented. The macropolitical is about conformation. The distinction between them is thus not one of scale, but of qualitatively different modes of activity, or contrasting tendencies.
