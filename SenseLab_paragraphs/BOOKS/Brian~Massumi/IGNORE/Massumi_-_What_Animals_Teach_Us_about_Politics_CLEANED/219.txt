Lived cartography never imitates. Its element is not the imitative “as if.” It is the inventive “thus.” “Thus” is “as if ” with a little something extra that exceeds all expectation. To make “as if ” reproduces a form. To do “thus” gives the form a singular twist. It brings self-surpassing to form, not through projection but through a creatively catalytic gestural -esque. When a human child plays animal, it is easy to mistake what it is thinkingdoing for a human game of imitation, as if the child were trying to make its own form conform to the animal’s. It’s all so cute, and easily sentimentalized. But according to both Simondon and Ruyer, imitation is a misshapen concept. In reality, one never simply imitates a form, in the sense of conforming oneself to the given form of another being. One can certainly make as if one were effectively imitating. But something else is really going on, unacknowledged and inexpressibly. For as Ruyer says, “one can only imitate what one is almost capable of inventing” (Ruyer 1952, 138).12 What, sentimentally, is taken for imitation is in fact the catalyzing of a germ of invention. It might fall on the infertile ground of humanly-political family, with its penchant for Oedipalization. But still: there is always that other dimension of potential deterritorialization in play. Something is bubbling, and the incipient catalysis it represents pertains not to animal form understood in any static and substantial sense, but rather to the dynamic form of sympathetic primary consciousness, surveying the situation from the integral animal perspective of its capacity to surpass the given. Do not underestimate the vital powers of animal “imitation.”
