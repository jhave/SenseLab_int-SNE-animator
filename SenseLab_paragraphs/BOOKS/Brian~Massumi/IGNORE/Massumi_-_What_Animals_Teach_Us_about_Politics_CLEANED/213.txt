The intensity of enthusiasm of the animal body, by contrast, is nonhedonic, and carries a feeling load of any number of mutually inclusive outcomes every step of the way, not just two conventionalized ones. Intensity is qualitatively extra by nature: a surplus-value of life. It answers only to immanent criteria pertaining to its own loading with potential, not to generic criteria of judgment applied from without. In itself, it is singularly unqualifiable. “Happy” or “sad,” even “pleasure” or “pain,” does not begin to express it. Happy and sad, pain and pleasure, are experienced in quantitative degrees, as on a thermometer of life feeling, or a rain gauge catching tears. The intensity of the vitality marked by enthusiasm of the body is immeasurable. It is purely qualitative. There is no gauging it. It is only thinking-doable, felt with an emotionally inexpressible excess of its own life quality. In other words, it can only be intuitively understood in live action. It can never be analyzed to death after the fact like emotion (which always invites overinterpretation when it isn’t being taken for granted). It can certainly be thought over, but every thinking back over it is a doing it again, differently, in really felt potential. Emotional content, isolated as it is from the performative force of vitality affect, is under the thrall of the already given. It is a most human expression of the generic dependence on the already thematically expressed. This is why it lends itself to melodrama, which plucks the strings of the already recognizable on the violin of feeling. Melodrama, and more broadly histrionics, is not just one variation on human emotion among others. It is its epitome.
