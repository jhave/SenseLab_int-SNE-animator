Instinct’s ludic folding back on its own intensity of self-driving variation slips a margin of play into the gaps, in the interactions between individuals, or between the individual and the environment. The hard necessities of life and the associated law of selective adaptation do not tell the whole story. There is always play in any mechanism, and instinct is no exception. In Ruyer’s words, there is always a “fortuitous fringe” of spontaneity propelling a creative autonomy of expression (Ruyer 1958, 142).
Returning to the hungry herring gull, if the chick’s tendency to improvise has a negligible effect on the effectiveness of the feeding behavior, its supernormal gestures will be destined to fall back into the immanence of nature whence they came. End of story: they will be indifferent to the reproductive success of the species, and will not be extended along the evolutionary line. But it is not inconceivable that the chick’s enthusiastic improvisation strikes a chord with the passion of the adult, resulting in an increase in the avidity with which she feeds her young. The increase in the efficiency of the feeding behavior increases the birds’ reproductive success. The improvisation, and whatever lent itself to its invention in the instinctive makeup of the chick in its appetitive relation to what its surroundings offer in the way of experience-intensifying affordances, might then be extended down the line by the forces of selective pressure. The imaginatively subjective exception ends up becoming the biological rule. The supernormal normalizes. The tendency to supernormality will have effectively contributed to the evolutionary genesis of a lasting variation on a form of life.
