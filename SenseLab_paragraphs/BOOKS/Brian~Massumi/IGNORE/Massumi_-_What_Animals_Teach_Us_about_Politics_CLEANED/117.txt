4. Political thought flourishes with noncognitive primary consciousness. This is thought in the act, flush with vital gesture. Noncognitive consciousness is actively nonrepresentative. But it is still, for all of that, already reflexive. It is reflexive in the special sense that the gestures it bodies forth open and maintain the gap between “is” and “could be.” Being and becoming reflect each other in the unicity of the ethico-aesthetic gesture. Primary consciousness is enactive. All of this suggests a politics of the performative gesture, alloying itself with practices of improvisational and participative art in the wild (beyond the territory of the gallery). Ethicoaesthetic  aesthetico-political. This orientation of animal politics awakens a certain suspicion with respect to concepts, such as Bruno Latour’s, of a “parliament of things.” Not least of all because the world is, in point of processual fact, populated by events more so than things. The world is made of verbs and adverbs more primordially than nouns and adjectives. One sniff at the parliament of things, and the animal’s expressive event is apt to snarl: smells of representation. One more effort to let nonrepresentational politics play to the supernormal hilt!
