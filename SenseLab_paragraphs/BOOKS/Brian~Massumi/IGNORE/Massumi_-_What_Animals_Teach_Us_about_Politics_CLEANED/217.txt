Denunciation is one thing. Drawing a cartography of vital gesture is another. All actions and feelings are vital gestures in some mode or another. Even the most antilife of gestures bubble with life at some level. A cartography of vital gesture registers the bubbles. It descends into the microfissures, to intuit what potential for singularization they herald. This can only be a lived cartography making the theme formative againâ€” inflectable in an inventive manner, vitally improvisable. Instead of replaying the same old theme song, the lived cartography of sentiment replays the situation, tweaking it toward outplaying itself. This requires that the individual fully assume its transindividual implication in the situation. The containment in emotion is translated back into glimmers of potential for transsituational escape. The reterritorialization of animal passion on human emotion is drawn back out toward a potential deterritorialization. The basically static emotional mood translates back into the conditional mode of active possibility.
