Primary consciousness is noncognitive and nonrepresentative. Logically speaking, it is neither inductive nor deductive but abductive. It plays the gaps of the immanent in-between with that minimum of difference that is the conditional gap between what this life, with which sympathy is coextensive, “is” and “could be.” The being of consciousness includes this conditional duplicity, suspending reference and representation. This makes it already reflexive, in that the act of intuition bringing it to be already carries in its incipiency a vital movement that reflects the immediacy of the event in its own possibilities.
