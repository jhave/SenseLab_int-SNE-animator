Human language carries the reflexivity of the communicative act and of its cartographic powers to their highest animal power. At the same time, the ludic possibilities of life are carried to a higher power, augmented by instantaneous back-and-forths between logical levels, between disparate domains of experience, and between those domains of experience and the creative movements by which they surpass themselves. From the most painful puns to the most exalted poetry, through every type and degree of humor and figurative usage, not to mention formalisms explicitly dedicated to operational mapping, language is forever busy flexing its reflexive capacities. It is always at work playing upon them.
