2. A politics that reestablishes ties with our animality, in its immanent movement of naturally supernormal self-surpassing, cannot be based on a normative ethics of any kind. Animal politics recognizes no categorical imperative. It lives the imperatives of the given situation, immanent to that situation, and it lives in paradox. Such a politics does not recognize the wisdom of utility as the criterion of good conduct. Rather, it affirms ludic excess. It does not cleave to the golden mean. It excessively lives out the in-between. Its ethico-aesthetic engagements play out between the imperative mood of lived importance, and lived abstraction’s vitally affective autonomy of movement, with the latter taking primacy. This primacy, it is crucial to point out, is processual, not moral. The supernormal tendency is the leading edge of becoming. It blazes life’s paths. But at the same time, every newly blazed path matures into a well-trodden road. What surpasses establishes itself, if it passes the test of selective adaptation. When it passes the test, it passes into capture, afterward to be imposed as a given. It is of the process of nature, and the nature of process, for ludic excess to pass into importance.
