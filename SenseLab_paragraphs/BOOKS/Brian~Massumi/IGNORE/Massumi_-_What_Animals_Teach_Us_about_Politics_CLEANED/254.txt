and the activity of physical beings. [ . . . ] We must speak [ . . . ] of the freedom [ . . . ] of physical beings. (1958, 158–160; emphasis added)
Life, Whitehead writes, “is a bid for freedom” (1978, 104). Everywhere on the continuum, from the human to depths of matter, and passing through everything in between, from wolf cubs to gulls to earthworms, not to mention amoebas, “ ‘life’ means novelty” (1978, 104). The novel has no predefined frame: “there is no absolute gap between ‘living’ and ‘non-living’ ” (1978, 102).
