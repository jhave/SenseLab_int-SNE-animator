The second task is reflexive. It consists in developing tools for the metadescription of tendential mixes, continually adding to the toolbox as new singular situations arise and beg for an analysis truly capable of taking their singularity into account. The metamodelization of animal life and natural politics consists in producing a conceptual field in which to house the growing menagerie of singular understandings. This requires a metaconceptual activity dedicated to constructing ways of mutually including in thought an always expanding menagerie of singular modes of tendenciesâ€™ processually belonging to each other, all the while meticulously respecting their irreducibly contrastive nature (i.e., without generalizing, and without mistaking their singularity for a particular instance of a general rule). This thinking of participatory thinking-doings cannot afford to stray far from the situations and events through which tendencies interpenetrate. Metamodelization must be resolutely pragmatic, even as it is constructing lived abstractions of the highest order.
