Ruyer insists that autonomous powers of variation are present in every instinctive activity of any kind (1958, 17–18, 27–28). If the instinctive act were as it is reputed to be—a stereotyped sequence of premodeled actions executed by reflex in the manner of an automatism—then instinct would be incapable of responding to chance changes in the environment (1958, 147). Chance variations in the environment must be matched by variation. This requires a certain creative plasticity, an improvisational margin of maneuver. Every instinctive act, no matter how stereotyped it normally seems to be, carries a margin of maneuver. Every instinct carries within itself a power of variation, to some degree or another. Every instinctive act holds a power of variation that we are well within our rights to call ludic, in the widest sense of the word. Or aesthetic, given the nature of the yield produced. For play’s margin of maneuver is “style”: the -esqueness that performs possibility. All of this obliges us to recognize expression as a vital operation as primordial as instinct itself. There is no life without surplus-value of life. There is no instrumentality without expressivity. Adaptation never comes without inventiveness. Expressivity and inventiveness are the cutting edge of the genesis of forms of life. It is through their margin of maneuver that the operational parameters of modes of existence are enlarged.
