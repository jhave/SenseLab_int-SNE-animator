The white whale of Moby Dick is another exemplary animal in the Deleuzo-Guattarian menagerie of pure expression. Moby Dick is not your average whale. He does not represent his species. He does not denote what it is to be a whale, or what normal, adaptive whale behaviors are. On the contrary, he expresses the supernormal tendency plying whaleness from within, and placing it on the integral animal continuum. He is not your normal animal, he is the Anomal, the anomalous animal: the tendential expression of a force of deforming supernormality capable of affectively, qualitatively enveloping in its singular manner the liminal integrality of an indefinite population (which is missing).4 Moby Dick is the receding horizon of being-whale. He is the transindividuating, extra-species becoming of whaleness, in person. But he is not a person. He is an envelope of becoming-animal potential. He is an envelope of animal potential becoming, wrapping the continuum of integral animality into the affective register of whalenessâ€”as only a written whale can do.
