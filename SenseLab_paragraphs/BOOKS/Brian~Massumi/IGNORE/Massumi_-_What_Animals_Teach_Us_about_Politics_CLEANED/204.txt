Under the mushy paving stones of the structure of identificatory sentimentality and the horror of its human politics—the beach of animal sympathy. Or: on the shores of the undifferentiating sea of human sentiment submerging the shipwreck of the zoe-bios separation—the tidal eddies of transindividual animality, tracing the differential lines of its tendential movements in the sands of every continent at once, regardless of the structural distances separating them. Or again: fringing and fissuring human emotion—vitally animal affect.
