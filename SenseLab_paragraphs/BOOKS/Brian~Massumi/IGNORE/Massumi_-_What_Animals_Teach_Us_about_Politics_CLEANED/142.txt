For the logic of mutual inclusion, indifference is not the only alternative to mutual exclusion (contra Agamben). It recognizes that there are zones of indiscernibility between species (a concept whose dependence on the logic of the excluded middle is under heavy attack from within biology itself, which, the more it becomes attuned to natureâ€™s continual production of variation, the less able it is to fix rigid generic, not to mention genetic, differences between animal populations).61 The logic of mutual inclusion conceives of these zones of indiscernibility positively, as the crucible of the emergence of the new. Far from being zones of indifference that absorb and disable activity, they are appetitively overfull of activity on the tendential move. They are veritable cuckoo nests of incipient activity, from which more difference eventuates. The logic of mutual inclusion is the logic of differentiation: the process of the continuing proliferation of emergent differences.
