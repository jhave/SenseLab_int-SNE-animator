Bateson draws a lesson from this: “it would be bad natural history to expect the mental processes and communicative habits of mammals to conform to the logician’s ideal. Indeed, if human thought and communication always conformed to the ideal, Russell would not—in fact, could not—have formulated the ideal” (180). Here Bateson is pointing to another mutual inclusion: that of the animal and the human. It is animality and humanity as a whole, and in their difference, that have paradoxically entered into a zone of indiscernibility.
