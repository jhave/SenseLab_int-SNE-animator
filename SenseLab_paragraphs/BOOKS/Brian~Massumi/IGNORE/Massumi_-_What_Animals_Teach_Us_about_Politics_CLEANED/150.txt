Note: The cutoff point of the “animal continuum” is unassignable, as is that of life. Animality and life cannot be strictly demarcated from the nonorganic. This is an inescapable consequence of affirming the logic of mutual inclusion. Calling nature’s continuum of mutual inclusion “animal” is, from this point of view, somewhat arbitrary. Continuums of tendential mixing are most conveniently grasped in the middle. This is because the poles of tendential movements are ideal: movements from a starting point that was never occupied, because in point of actual fact there has never been anything other than mixtures in nature; and movements to a destination point that is never reached, because tendings never end, so that mixings never cease. Another way of saying this is that tendencies are defined by virtual limits.62 Speaking of animality is a way of starting in the middle, as Deleuze and Guattari advise is always best (1987, 21–23, 25, 293). Pragmatically, it is always best to start smack in the middle of the glorious mess that is the actual world, where lived abstraction is always already spiked with lived importance, giving thinking-doing real stakes. The continuum of nature could just as easily be called the continuum of creativity, or of consciousness, or of instinct, or of life, or even of matter (redefined in such a way as not to be mutually exclusive of these or of the virtual, yielding an “incorporeal materialism”).63 Or—why not?—even of the plant. The choice of “animal continuum” as the dominant appellation here has a simple but crucial motivation: with a little imagination, it allows the real stakes to revolve around play.
