However, for us who, retrospectively, have never been modern, the state of nature is not what it was. The law of competition has had to bow before a healthy dose of cooperation, whose crucial contributions to evolution are now widely acknowledged, with symbiosis accepted as the very origin of multicellular life (Margulis 1999; Nowak 2011). It is no longer out of the question, in view of these developments, to place sympathy on equal footing with aggression as a factor in nature. At the same time, the rigid image of the animal as a mechanism dominated by the automatism of instinct is showing signs of slackening, to give greater margin to individual variations, as evidenced in the rise of a new research area in ethology dedicated to animal “personality” (Carere and Maestripieri 2013). As we will see, instinct itself shows signs of elasticity, even a creativity one might be forgiven for labeling artistic.
