The Spinozist lesson of the cuckoo and the herring gull: the animal’s enthusiasm of the body is one with its mental power of appetition,19 whose propulsivity advances an expressive autonomy swept forward by the vital gestures of the play of instinct.
It is easy to see the evolutionary advantages of a supernormal tendency: it gives instinct a creative margin of maneuver. The pull of the supernormal toward the relational variation of forms of life activity predisposes the animal to an enthusiastic acceptance of emergent variations. The passion of appetition pulls forward toward variations on forms of life, upstream of the adaptive pressures that make the final, irrevocable selection in accordance with the necessities of survival. There is no question that the environment exerts selective pressure. Adaptation is indeed the law of the external milieu. The lesson of the supernormal tendency is that there is more to nature’s ways than law-abiding behavior. To the law of selective adaptation, instinct opposes a power of improvisation more than eager to respond to the call for conformity to external demands with a supernormal twist. Instinct takes the liberty of inventing proposed solutions. It does not content itself with finding its solutions already sketched in negative outline in environmental constraints. Given the choice between conformity to the limitative demands of adaptation and death, it invents a third way: the excess invention of a more to life. An inventiveness immanent to the topology of experience, one with its lived qualities, at its most subjective leading edge, spontaneously responds to adaptive pressures. For this immanent inventiveness, some give the name “desire.”
