Sym-: together; -pathy: to be affected. What affective consciousness “sympathizes” with is the dynamic form of what is coming, affecting one and all, differently together, and as thematically oriented. In a word, affective consciousness is the immediate experience of the transindividual affect of the unfolding event. “Affect” is used here without a qualifier to encompass both vitality affect and categorical affect, as they thematically come together, in a complex. Sympathy is the primary consciousness of the affective complex in play. It includes an immediately felt awareness of the affective complexion of the situation (the texture of vitality affect and categorical affect; their manner of mixture and tendential ratio).
