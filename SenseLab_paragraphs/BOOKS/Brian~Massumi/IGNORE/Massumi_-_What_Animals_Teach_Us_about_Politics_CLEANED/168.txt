Deleuze and Guattari also speak of exemplary written -esqueness in relation to rats. They invoke the bizarrely affecting manner in which a nest of rats in a Hofmannstahl story flail in their death throes, saying that what their gestures induce is not pity but “unnatural participation.” By “unnatural” they don’t mean off the continuum of nature. They mean: in becoming toward an “unknown nature,” a supernormal nature (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 240, 258). Once again writing gives pure supernormal expression to the integral animal, this time in the register of rat. The writing denotes what this supernormality would integrally denote. The animality of the rodent becomes-human (suspends itself in written gesture) at the same time as the human becomes-animal (passionately renews its constitutive ties to the instinctive core of its own supernormality).
