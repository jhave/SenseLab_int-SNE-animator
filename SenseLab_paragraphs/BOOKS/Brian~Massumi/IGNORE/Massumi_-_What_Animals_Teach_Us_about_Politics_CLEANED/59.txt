In order to take full stock of what supernormal stimuli tell us about instinct, the complex uncertainty they reveal at the heart of instinct must be construed in positive terms. The capacity to produce unexpected outcomes that are not related in linear fashion to discrete, isolatable inputs is an essential aspect of instinct. It must be acknowledged that instinctual movements are animated by a tendency to surpass given forms, that they are moved by an impetus toward creativity. Further, this immanent impetus toward creativity must be recognized as a mental power, with mentality defined in neo-Humean fashion in terms of the capacity to surpass the given. The engine of this surpassing is not the recognition of a given form, but rather the integral deformation of indissociably linked qualities of experience: the spontaneous production of what Deleuze and Guattari call “blocks of sensation.”16 No efficient cause can be singled out as pushing this movement of experience’s self-surpassing from behind. The comparison to gambling is not entirely out of place. There is an element, not so much of blind mechanistic chance, as, to spin it positively, of spontaneity. Ruyer makes much of the fact that an instinct can trigger itself, even in the absence of any stimulus. He characterizes this ability as “hallucinatory,” in the sense that it is “improvised directly” on the percept (1958, 146–147). This capacity of spontaneous improvisation, he adds, must be considered a necessary dimension of all instinct. Another word for this native hallucinogenic power is the one Hume uses: imagination. Whatever the name, what we’re dealing with is not a slot machine but a first degree of mentality in the continuum of nature.
