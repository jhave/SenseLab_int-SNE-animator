Human emotion is feeling limited to replaying itself, to the extent possible, within known parameters: that same old song. The intensity of vitality affect, on the other hand, always vitally overplays itself. Its containment in human emotion is devitalizing. Its containment is countervital. It is animal antilife, crying against inventive excess. The excessiveness that remains in emotion is an expression of vitality affect and the enthusiasm of the body pressing to make itself felt. The remainder of excess in emotion is vestigially remembered in the wordâ€™s etymological root. E-movere: to outmove (oneself ); to dynamically surpass oneself.
