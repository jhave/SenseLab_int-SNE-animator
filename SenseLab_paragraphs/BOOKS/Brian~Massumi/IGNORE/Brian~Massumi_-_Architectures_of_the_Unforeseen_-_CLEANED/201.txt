Understanding perception as a function of the architectural surface provides the non-phenomenological approach to the body that Lynn's architectural design process requires. It allows the physical body and its perceptions to be reintegrated into the design process. But at the same time, it enables that reintegration to occur in what might seem an oddly peripheral manner, as a function of surface concerns. In project descriptions, perceptual effects are mentioned with a nonchalance that seems to belie their integral contribution to the design process. Mention is made of their infolding into the topological variations populating the process, in the guise of virtual forces programmed into the generative field; as is their outfolding into a superficial taking-effect of that formative influence, defining the way in which the process continues into the built form (as described in relation to the Korean Presbyterian Church).
