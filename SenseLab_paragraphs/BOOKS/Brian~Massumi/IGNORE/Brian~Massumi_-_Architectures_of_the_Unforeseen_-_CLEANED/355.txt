Every string plucked, every throat cleared, vibrates a [background] vibration, modifies an existing difference [and is modified by it]. Sound is a modulation of difference, a difference of difference. […] Noise is the uncontracted, the depth from which these contractions of perception are drawn, and, though sense-less and insensible [in itself], it makes sense or gives sense to sound, by providing sound with its direction and focusing it to a point of clarity. Noise is the reservoir of sense, the depth in which sounds connect to each other, the difference whose modulation is signal. […]  sounds only have sense when what is heard includes not only what is heard clearly, but includes also the implicated in what is heard [the obscurity of the background, fading out into all directions to the ground of grounds, from which the clear and distinct stands out]. To hear meaningful sound – be it the articulate meaning of speech or the ineffable meaning of music – is to hear sound in motion, heading somewhere.  [...] Noise draws along with it a residue of obscurity, lines of relaxation which anchor sound to the noise it modulates. Sound implicates these obscure tethers, which connect sound to noise […] implicating worlds of forces not yet unleashed, but whose reservoir powers the music [or linguistic expression], driving it along. […] Implication pushes [language] forward […] and this motion is not created by the [words] but produces them as [the expression] of its force. […] Implication is what connects isolated elements to each other, in a creative synergy.xxxvii
