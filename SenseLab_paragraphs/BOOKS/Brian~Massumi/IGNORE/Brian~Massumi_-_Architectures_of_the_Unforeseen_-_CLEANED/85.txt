Overall, the process is of a self-differing addition of and to the virtual: virtual proliferation, in the passing. The fact that the virtual is only accessible through analogical procedures, and that for the concept of simulation to be useful it must be borne in mind that simulation is not the virtual but rather simulation is OF the virtual, are extremely important asides. But they are beside the main point here, which is how things enter mutually-inclusively into the design.
