One of the main ingredients in this event has not been mentioned: the giant in-stadium screens. These provide instant feedback to the fans in the stadium of their own enthusiasm, so that it feeds on itself. This affective feedback mechanism is directly collective: it reflects the fan's concertation back into its own continuing. Using the stadium-wave as exemplary of what a body is raises a fundamental question: Can there be such a thing as a body without a surface? The notion of an ephemeral body is not terribly brain-teasing. But a body without a surface? If such a thing did exist, why would it be relevant to architecture? Isn't architecture traditionally defined precisely as a play between volume and surface? Here, there is neither.
