What is left is the "theme" of language itself. What participants are primed for is language as such, aside from any particular enaction of its content. Its force is felt, in gesture, just out of reach of achieved content. The formative implication of language with the extraverbal is gestured to, in a grabbing at words hanging out of reach at the tip of the thumb and the sweep of a beam. The element of "Amodal Suspension" is no longer culturability. Instead, it is reaching-toward-language, finality of meaning deferred. The event of language is compellingly incompleted. This event is performatively one with its content, which is now nothing but the force of language as such. This is what shows between the flashes.
