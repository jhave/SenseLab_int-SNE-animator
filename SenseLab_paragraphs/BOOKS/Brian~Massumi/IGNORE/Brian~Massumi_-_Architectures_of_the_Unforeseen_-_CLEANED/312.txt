We are speaking of art. But is aesthetics relevant here? What would be the aesthetic form of the work of relational art? It could only be the dynamic form of the act of culture’s coming, in an instantaneous sweep across dimensions of event: act, domain, field; response, fusion, far-reaching unbound. The act's aesthetic is the way in which the occurrent domain’s autonomous participation feeds immediately forward into the participative autonomy of its accomplishment. The work’s aesthetic effect is the live feeling of the sweep, replete with real and pure potential: the vitality affect marking its manner of coming to pass.
