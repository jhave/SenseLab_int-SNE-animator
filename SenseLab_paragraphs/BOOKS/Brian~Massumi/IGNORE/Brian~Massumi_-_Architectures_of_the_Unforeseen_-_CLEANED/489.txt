To keep the making to place sufficiently abstract, you have to create an artificial space, one without the usual constraints. But not without constraints of its own. There is no such thing as a place without constraints. Existing art spaces are highly artificial already. They are in a way pre-abstracted, full of embedded abstract constraints that are so familiar they are easy to overlook. The artificiality of the places of art is naturalized by over-familiarity, ingrained expectations, and many a tendentious overlay of meaning and identifying/labeling history. That is why it is necessary to peel them: to re-artificialize them. To make them live up to their artificiality and the living power of abstraction they are sometimes capable of housing, providing they don't have their top on too tight. Otherwise there is precious little chance for a lifebow to form. The emergent effect is more likely to be a knowing nod, or weary sigh.
