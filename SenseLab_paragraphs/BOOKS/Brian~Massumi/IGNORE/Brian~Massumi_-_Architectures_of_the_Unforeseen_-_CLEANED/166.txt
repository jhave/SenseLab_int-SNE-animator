Architecture-related events are typically categorized as falling into the domestic-inside and the urban-outside. But the architectural surface, understood in this way as the dynamic form of a  becoming-body event made visible in concrete form, is not just a divider between an inside and an outside. It is an active membrane. Walls, roof, and floors establish a regime of passage between the open fields on either side of them. When you go in or out, you toggle between domestic and urban events. The separation between the two domains is not airtight. They trail affectively into each other, mutually modulating, interfusing. When the sound of a storm, or the noise of a passing car passes the membrane, or an internet feed or radio transmission infiltrates, the domestic-inside and urban- and media-outside, bleed together. They fuse, paned on a window or cabled through a wall. When you storm out of the house at the speed of a domestic spat, the becoming-body of that abstract event concretely swings on the hinges of the slammed door. The architectural surface is a transducer between the open fields, in the fold between which architectural body-events take shape. Through endless iterations of going in and going out, through the many panings, cablings, and hinge-swings and all manner of other passages, it brings affective effects fielded inside the walls into fusional continuity with affective effects fielding outside. The folding together of the fields forms a duplex: a single, two-sided transductive field of intensity. This is the affective matter of architecture. The dynamic form of architecture stands intensively in (and out of) its concrete form.
