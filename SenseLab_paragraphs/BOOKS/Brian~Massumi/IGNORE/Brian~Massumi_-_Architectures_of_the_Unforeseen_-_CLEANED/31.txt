At these points, I can already hear the reader protesting, but the work doesn't actually do that! Perhaps it doesn't. But it is no less true that it has released the aparalleled potential for it: the proof being that it has come out in the writing. If the writing has been successful, the speculative, as such, takes effect in it. Philosophically, that is what it is ultimately about.
