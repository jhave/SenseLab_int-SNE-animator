A particularly instructive example of this occurred at a public presentation several years ago of a very early draft of this essay.xxxv A famous psychoanalytically-inclined literary critic in the audience became visibly agitated by the carryings-on of the blobs on screen. When the question and answer period came, his hand shot up. In a tone that announced that the coming comment would trump the entire presentation, he pronounced: “But of course, they’re breasts.” But of course. Why hadn’t I noticed? Why hadn’t I realized that Lynn was not pragmatically enacting an impersonal creative process but was only acting out a melancholic repetition-compulsion to return metaphorically to his own all-too-human beginnings? Why had I been taken in by all this topological mumbo-jumbo? Multiple singular-generic, my foot (or is that swollen foot?). It was all so simple, so clichéd, so abject and unaffirmative all along. I had been deceived by Lynn’s self-deception. Partners in disavowal, caught out by the penetrating critic.
