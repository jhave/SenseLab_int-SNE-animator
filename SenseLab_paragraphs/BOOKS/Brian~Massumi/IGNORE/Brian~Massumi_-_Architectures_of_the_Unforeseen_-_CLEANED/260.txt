Out of the laboratory, in a less controlled, more richly multisensory situation, language’s force for existence – the immediate word-borne coloring of nextness – is multiplied, complexified, and varied. The range of what may spin forth expands indefinitely. The tendency imparted by words heard or seen, or even unheard and unseen, may be as readily a kinesthesetic event of altered pace as a lexical association. It can be a predisposition to touch, as easily as an inflection of affective valence. And – why not? – the triggered tendency might be toward the dawning of a new idea, spun of a suggestive complexity of inter-register experience, rather than the tired acting out of a time-wrinkled stereotype. Bingo!
