The "Amodal Suspension" archive is many ways the heart of the installation. It will be very rare that the person to whom a message is addressed manages to catch it out of the air. The mass of messages will settle into the online archive. The addresee will have to extract it from the archive. Once again, the process is designed to have a strong element of tactility. The messages populate a 3D virtual space that recedes in all directions. The farther away they are, the more blurred the words. The bring the words into focus, the participant has to navigate through the space with the mouse. The navigation has the feel of swimming. Using the mouse is like paddling with your hands in a liquid. You agitate the cursor to create eddies in the liquid archive of communication. The eddies will catch a message on their swell and flush it toward the front of the screen. When one washes forward, it crests into focus and can be read. The tactility of this eddy-fishing for the message gives the digital archive a turbulently analogue experiential dimension.
