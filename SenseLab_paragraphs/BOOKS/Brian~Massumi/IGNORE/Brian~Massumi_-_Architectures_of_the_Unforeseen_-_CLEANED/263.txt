The direct inhabitation of action-perception by words has enormous consequences. For interactive art, it means that text can be an immediate ingredient of the performance as such. The presence of text does not necessarily “mediate” experience. This significantly expands the parameters of performance and the field of interactivity – to the limits of language (and its inter-register gregariousness). In a very real sense, words activate their “content” as an ingredient in the interaction. Just without the actual content (tendentially).
