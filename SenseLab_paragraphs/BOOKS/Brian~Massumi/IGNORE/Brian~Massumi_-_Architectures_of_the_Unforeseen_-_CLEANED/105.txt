Its continuability is so open-ended that even the “completed” building will have to be considered essentially provisional. It could just as well have been any number of other buildings, if the programming and negotiated re-programmings had, by chance of chaotic circumstance, run slightly differently. The building retains an element of the generic, even in its concrete particularity. The finality of the design is by nature deferred. There is no one moment where the architect can stand back from the process and say: I, creative master, have spoken in my form; read what I have said. The design process is less an external conduit for the artist’s creativity than the artist is a conduit for creativity of the design process. Every constraint that gets internalized, from the very first run, is a literal co-author of the form: another of its intrinsic growth factors. The process takes on a certain autonomy of expression. The architect admits his inability to control exactly how the form will emerge and what it will “say” when it does (how it will be “read”). The architect is less a Godly creator than a desk-bound shaman abstractly summoning powers of virtual transformation through the medium of the computer, coaxing them to express themselves in a particular form.
