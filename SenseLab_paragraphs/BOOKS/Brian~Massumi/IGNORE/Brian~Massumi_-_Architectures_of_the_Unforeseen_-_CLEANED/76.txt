Much of the uneasiness that surrounded Lynn’s work has precisely to do with the affirmative approach by which the architect enters a zone of indistinction with his or her instruments. Lynn’s work aroused a tremendous amount of anxiety and even anger over what was repeatedly characterized as an ‘over-enthusiatic’ and ‘uncritical’ embrace of the computer. No less than Peter Eisenman railed that architects like Lynn who adopt an affirmative posture are trying to mire the discipline in their own “cybernetic hallucinations.”vi Nothing so dramatic as an apocalypse. More like an adolescent indulgence. From where Eisenman stands, architecture seems to have gamboled off on a digital acid trip. Where Eisenman stands, interestingly, is in many respects very close. He is himself a pioneer in the use of computerized topological methods in architecture,vii stylistically Lynn’s designs are often considered to echo Eisenman’s, and Eisenman mentored him into the profession. For all of that, in the final analysis Lynn and Eisenman must be seen as inhabiting different worlds, different architectural monads.
