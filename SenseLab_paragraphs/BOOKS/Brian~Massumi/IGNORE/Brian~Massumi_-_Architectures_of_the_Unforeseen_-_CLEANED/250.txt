The body is thus more-than its connective organization at any given moment. It carries through its movements a surplus “charge” of organization to come. At any given moment, the body is more-than any particular connection it is in the process of making, and it is even more-than the sum total of the connections it has made. A body is also the surplus charge of coming connection it carries forward. To say that the phenomenal body has no particular organization and is without connection is to say that it exceeds its own phenomenal existence. In the about-to-come of each moment, in each gestating tendency, the body is its own dynamic openness to new connection and re-organization. It is its own capacitation for what’s coming. In its dynamic openness and as its capacitation, the body’s potential organizations and connections are all immediately present to each other, mutually included in the moment’s gestation. They are integrally fused in the intensity of the tending just now taking individual shape as the determinate step it soon will have been. The fusional intensity is integrally felt. Since that feeling envelops, more or less vaguely, what is not present (present only in potential), it couches the body in abstract realms of its own extension, in a more-than of its phenomenal appearance. The kinesthetic amoeba is the phenomenal body integrally self-abstracting, ahead of itself, at a potential distance from where and what it is. Here, it surfaces across the architectural façade, become interface, in a becoming-body event of the kind discussed in chapter 1.
