A social act is open to the sayings of others. It doesn't have to be rebegun, for the simple reason that it never ends. It undulates across a continuous rhythm of words reacting upon reservoired words, in rippling waves. A social act doesn't perish. Its rising already subsides into the background noise of the sea of sociality. Culturability culminates in a placeable determination. Sociability ebbs and flows with the vagueness of a continuous background murmur. Sociability and culturability overlap. A cosmic culturing current runs through sociability, overspilling it at both limits. Culturability incipiently outstretches the social at the immanent cosmic limit, to rejoin the full stretch of the nature-culture continuum. At the opposite pole, it  oversteps sociability to enact its own internal human limit in a taking determinate communicational form. The two domains are overlapping, interfused, but asymmetrical, hanging between off-set limits and angling their enaction through different elemental lenses.
