Lynn explicitly marks the composite paradigm as a turning point, in self-critical terms that distances him from his "folding in architecture" persona of the 1990s. This is no doubt in large part to the enduring reputation as the blob guy that still dogs him in some quarters, despite the tremendous diversification of his design activities and techniques. It is not that he leaves behind any of his techniques, let alone topological architecture as a whole. He is a collector and cross-contaminator of techniques. The blobs melt into the crowd of proliferating techiques, but they don't necessarily disappear from use. Every technique is always in reserve, ready to recur. The concern for performance itself notably recurs to the boat hull discussed in Animate Form, whose form stores toggles between performance settings in its own form, as well as to the fins of the Korean Presbyterian Church.cii The turn in Lynn's practice is not a renunciation of his curvy topological past. The self-critique concerns a specific processual strategy, rather than any set of techniques or the topological approach as such. That strategy is "form-finding."ciii
