Rhythm is the most perceptually salient dimension of language. Phonemes disappear into their meaning. You don't hear them to the exact degree to which you understand them. But their rhythm asserts itself, an experienced something-extra that conveys an emphasis, accent, tone, or mood. The rhythm carries the force of the phrase, above and beyond its structure and meaning. "Amodal Suspension" uses encoding to make visible this extra-linguistic effectiveness: the force of language. This is the variable that is being analogically presented. The display conveys the feel of a statement's impact without its meaning. We get the same feel from the firefly’s inhuman light show of exoskeletal love. It is impossible to watch them and not get the uncanny feeling that they are “talking” to each other.
