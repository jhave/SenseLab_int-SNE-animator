What is “dematerialized” are the limits of the local (its limitation to being all and only what it is). The local features in the performance from the angle of what passes through it: a sweep of times and a zoom of spaces for which the specificity of the site is a way-station. The confines of the local open, without the local disappearing. The status of the site changes. It features as a node in larger, global, movements connecting through it with each other and the body.
