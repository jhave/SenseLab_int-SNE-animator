Lynn points out that there is an inherent abstractness to the most basic instruments of architecture, which has always maintained a privileged relation to geometry, and will necessarily continue to do so. Architecture's traditional focus on the classical geometry of the basic Euclidean figures and Platonic solids has had to share the lime-light in recent years with topology. Topological design techniques had to wait for the computer for their full deployment. First introduced into architectural practice in the late 1980s, as the cost of computing-power came down their use became increasingly widespread, if not ubiquitous.ii For Lynn, a pioneer in topological design techniques, this development cannot be neutral to the concept of architecture. He exhorts designers interested in rethinking the history and changing shape of their discipline to attend to their instruments. This requires a willingness to engage with the abstractness of the computer-assisted design space: its specifically topological abstractness. Yet more specifically, its topological abstractness as accessed by animation software of the kind used in film, as opposed to the traditional CAD used to digitize the familiar architectural drafting process. All of this entails a radical change in perspective.
