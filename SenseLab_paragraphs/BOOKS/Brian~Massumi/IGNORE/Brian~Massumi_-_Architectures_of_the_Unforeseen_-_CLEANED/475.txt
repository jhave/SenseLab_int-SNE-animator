To clear the sites of her art, she ventures out into them without alibi, not knowing what she will find, and without any preconceived notion of what form the forming artwork will eventually take. The journey is full of stories, styles, historical frameworks and material textures. None of these, however, will be what the artwork is about. For the stories, styles, frameworks and materials, she uses an action word rather than an indicator of linguistic reference: triggers. There is no "about" here. It's simply not about. It's round-about the place. It's all in the activity, in the moving through and back and forth, and what the action triggers into taking form.
