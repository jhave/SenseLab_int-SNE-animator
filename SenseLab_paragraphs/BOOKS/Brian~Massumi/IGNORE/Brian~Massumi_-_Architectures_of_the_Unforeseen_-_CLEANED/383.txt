"Amodal Suspension" organizes a crosswise co-generative movement that intersects, once again, in bare activity. There is once again a playing out of the material quality of an event, involving an amodal fusion of registers of experience, gesture with vision with tactility. But "Amodal Suspension" suspends the said-and-doneness of the cultural act, which is admitted in the other works. In "Amodal Suspension," the movement of communication is not allowed to complete itself in a particularizable, individually ownable, message making a functional difference in effective call-and-response. The messages sent are bounced back and forth between machine-translation smudged Japanese and English, thus preventing them from settling into a specific coordinate of a particular cultural map. Insistently detoured into a thirdness of poached and reported speech, the messages are prevented from channeling into a two-party exchange. All of this creates interference, noise on the line, by design. The messages subside forthwith into the eddies of the archive/Archive. Mission doubly incompleted. Even if a message reaches an intended recipient, it does not do so without being simultaneously refracted into indefinitely prolongable third-party transmission and the indeterminate afterlife of citation. The language act is unmoored from the shores of finalized human communication. The internal limit of human communication is disenabled. This remits communication to the open field. Messages are deprived of the luxury of falling to grid in a cultural domain. "Amodal Suspension" disenables the achievement of noise-reduced intersubjective communication. It contrives for the language acts it does enable to fall short of ownable human individuation. Its flashes flush the internal limit away. This jogs it toward the immanent limit, by default.
