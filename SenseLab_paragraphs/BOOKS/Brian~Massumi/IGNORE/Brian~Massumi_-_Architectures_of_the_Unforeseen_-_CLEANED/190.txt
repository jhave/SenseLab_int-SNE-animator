This entails a very different relationship of part to whole than the way it usuall conceived. The part-whole relationship is no longer a structural contrast. It is a contrast, but not between the parts as such and the structure of the whole they compose through their local, part-to-part functional connections. The contrast, rather, is between the singularity of the detail and the stand-out integral effect. But wait: "there are no details per se. Detail is everywhere, ubiquitously distributed and continuously variegated."lxxii What is seen is the everywhereness of the variegation. It is their manner of their coming-together nonlocally that is seen. It is the interfusion of details that is seen – their fusional multiplicity – rather than any structural contrast. The contrast between the details and the integral effect subsists, but at the same time, it disappears into the fusion-effect. This is what is meant by intricacy. As mentioned earlier, you see the overform of the wave at the price of unseeing its details. But the wave wouldn't be there if its details weren't proactively lending themselve to its appearance.lxxiii The local elements composing the wave are seen only in effect. However, they can reappear for themselves with a shift in attention, in a toggle from the plane of the effect to the plane of detail. There is a constitutive "flicker between discrete elements and smooth figural flow."lxxiv The integral perception of the wave envelops this flicker as its condition of emergence, blinking it out into its own surfacing. There is no deep structure to the wave. It consists entirely in its own effective surfacing.
