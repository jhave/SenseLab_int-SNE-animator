Yet another terminological option would be to call thought-signs the “virtual reality” of the life of the body. It wouldn’t be the best option. The term still suffers from the legacy of 1980s/1990s cyberculture vocabulary, for which “virtual” was a synonym for “artificial” and “illusory,” in the sense of standing at a mediated remove from reality, in simulation of it. Material qualities pertain to immediately real yet abstract body events. They are fully and directly real.
