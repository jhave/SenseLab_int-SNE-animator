A one-word question: politics? What I have termed the generosity of the openness of Lynn's process to outside formative forces, and its willingness to fold those forces in as processual collaborators, constitutes an ethics of design. But what of the politics of design? An ethics that mutually includes customizable low-cost housing and BMW design on an equal processual footing elides the question of politics. Must the politics come from outside, critically applied to design process and products? That would invalidate the entire premise of topological architecture, which is predicated on an integral becoming-immanent of any and all formative factors, co-composing toward the emergence of novel form. But where, in the process of topological architectural design, as conceptually shadowed in this philosophical retelling of it, does the political enter in as formative factor? Can the political not fold fusionally in, as the aesthetic did, so that it does not have adjoin itself to the process extrinsically, as an external framing, imposed constraint, or outside judgment, and instead becomes active immanent to the process, as an orienting growth factor?
