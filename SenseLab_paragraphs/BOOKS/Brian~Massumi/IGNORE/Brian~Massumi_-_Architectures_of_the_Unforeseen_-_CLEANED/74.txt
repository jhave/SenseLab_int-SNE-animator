Architecture, for Lynn, is affirmative. It will embrace its incidentals and its outside. In other words, it will be attracted to its own limits. Like the topological figure, the identity of architecture will describe itself as an endless movement to the limit. Its identity will occur to it, as a limit-event – deferred. Like the topological figure, architecture will affirm itself as its own continuing deformation; as absolutely its own continuous variation. It will affirm its process, as a work in progress. It will still be the “same” discipline, generically speaking. Because it won’t be cut off, from the world at large or from its own past processings. Lynn makes no self-aggrandizing claims to the “revolutionary,” “radical,” or “avant-garde.” To those in the early years who greeted his technology-happy practice with mutterings of “anti-architecture” or the “death of architecture” he calmly responds: no, it continues. Sorry, no apocalypse here. Just the same multiply singular generic, going on. Something architectural is doing, although you will never know what it is to your exacting satisfaction (its identity deferred, by the very doing of it).
