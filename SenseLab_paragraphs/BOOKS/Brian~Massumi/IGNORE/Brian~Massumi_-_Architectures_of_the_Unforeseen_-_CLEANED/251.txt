It would be a misake to equate this fusional intensity with a “feeling” in any sense we might be tempted to qualify with the word “mere.” It is not a mere feeling, as in a mere fantasy or mere subjective impression. These “meres” connote irreality. The charging of the moment with an integral life potential is not only real. It is the body’s charge of reality: surplus reality. Not mere, more: a reality of the more-than of one’s embodied self in movement and becoming. More wrapped up in feeling than can be merely felt.
