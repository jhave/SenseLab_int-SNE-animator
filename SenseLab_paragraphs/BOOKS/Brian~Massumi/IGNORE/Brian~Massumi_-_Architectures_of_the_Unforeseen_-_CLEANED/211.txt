All of this increases the robustness of topological architecutre, and adapts it to contexts from which it was formerly excluded. Part of the motivation for the Embryological House was to provide the possibility of low-cost housing (including post-disaster emergency housing) that could be tailored to individual, cultural, or contextual variations without the cost premium usually associated with customization. In addition, the process can be scaled, applying these benefits across the spectrum of design, from small household objects to large buildings. Architecture fans out across the continuum of design.
