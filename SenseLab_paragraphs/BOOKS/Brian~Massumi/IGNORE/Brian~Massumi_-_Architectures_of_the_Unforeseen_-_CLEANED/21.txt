Staging a probematic overlap of a philosophic practice and an art practice leaves neither unscathed. The problematic nodes of the artworking embed enabling constraints in the philosophic writing. These are like proto-conceptual eggs, cysts of coming concepts that hatch alien tendencies in the philosophy whose maturation in the writing propel the philosophizing toward a change in consistency. There can be no application of a conceptual framework: in philosophy, the systematicity is emergent. From this perspective, the status of the art practice for the philosophizing is as the non-philosophical field immanent to philosophy's becoming.iv The problems creatively geared into by the artistic practice as conditioning its own process are transduced into philosophic problems entering into the constitution of a new philosophic expression. Problems leap from one process to another, like jumping genes. From the other side, the status of the philosophic practice for the artworking is as a coming-to-conceptual-expression of proto-concepts already stirring within it and itching to condition its process more fully. The philosophical expression of these constitutive problems can potentially fold back into the art process, and modulate its subsequent adventures. Transduction can go both ways. It wants to go both ways. It is an aparallel evolution: a becoming-different-together, in processual overlap and mutually transformational feedback.
