Architecture has all manner of body-events, on any number of levels and scales. Essential to the architectural design process are techniques for transducing form-making, or form-taking, becoming-body-events from one level and scale to another. Each transduction moves the process to a new associated milieu (a different duplexing of open generative fields). The supreme abstractness of the digital phases of topological design process enables architecture to infold into its abstract surfaces all manner of formative forces from all manner of generative fields, digitally rendered virtual, thence to unfold them again, across an interval of construction, into body-events occurring on other levels and scales.lvi The digital is the most intensive architectural matter of all.
