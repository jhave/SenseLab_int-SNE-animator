Today is winter solstice, and things are different. It is the day of the year your shadow is longest. Standing in a meadow, my shadow stretches impossibly long, the full length of the field, far beyond my step. This gives me an uncanny sense of being drawn to the measure of a meadow, my coming action flattened and amplified to a stretch of grass. Now my shadow doesn’t comfort me. It vegetates me. When I step and project a next stretch, I feel that it is the meadow that has grown in my motion. I take on the meadow’s inhuman stretch, as the meadow takes on the future-cast of my animation. I am an ambulant spread of weed. I vegetate the world.
