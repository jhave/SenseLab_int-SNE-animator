There are risks. The artist will see her words escape from her, into the defiles of philosophy. Her constitutive problems will hatch anew and mutate, then mate with other problems plying the philosophic field. For philosophy is not innocent. It is haunted by its past consistencies. In spite of philosophy's possession by its own past systematizations, it retains a transductive openness. However steeped in its own history, a philosophic practice retains the ability to overlap with constitutive problems belonging to a non-philosophical field. This can only be because the problems were already stirring within it, after its own manner. It was feeling the itch (again, it goes both ways). As Raymond Ruyer said, you can only imitate what you are already almost capable of inventing.v What is at issue is indeed a kind of imitation, a kind of mimcry, where one process inventively takes on the problematic curves of another's incipient gestures. Through this transductive relation, philosophic writing becomes a kind of ventriloquism, in which it is not always certain which one is speaking. That uncertainty was consciously taken on board in the essay on Gill as an enabling constraint. Gill's own words were taken up into the writing in a way that made it impossible to attribute any given formulation unambiguously to one or the other of us. In the leadup to the essay's original publication in the 2013 Venice Biennale catalogue for the Australian Pavillion, this drove the copyeditor mad. An all-out war over pronomial propriety and the owning of speech ensued.
