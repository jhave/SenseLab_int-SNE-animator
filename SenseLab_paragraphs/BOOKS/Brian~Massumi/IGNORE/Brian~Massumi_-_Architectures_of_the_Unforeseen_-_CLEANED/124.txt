Metaphor is on the tongue of the beholder. Metaphors are produced adjacent to, and in uptake from, the form-generating process. They occur where a visual apprehension of a sameness in the generated form authorizes an assimilation between that form and another already-constituted form. Metaphor starts from a pregiven form from which it extracts identifying properties, like curviness. The form is recognized on the basis of those properties as a particular case of a general class, taken as predefined. A second class of forms is seen to exhibit the same properties, albeit combined with other properties not exhibited by the first form. The partial overlap of recognizable properties enables a transference to be effected between the forms whereby the functions of one are attributed to the other (in this example, functions of a sexual nature). The functions also are taken as predefined. Once the transfer is established, it can be refined and expanded through linguistic associations underwritten by the symbolic structure of a signifying system. The symbolic structure, once again, is pregiven.xxxvii
