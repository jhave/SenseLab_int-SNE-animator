The built sanctuary-form succeeds in continuing the process. The fin operator intensifies a formal design element by imbuing it with perceptual “potential energy.” This imbuing of the actual with a virtual co-presence of potentials is quite real. But it is also quite limited, in ways entirely appropriate to the circumstances. The lighting effect focused on the pulpit lends the minister a God-like air. The toggle between points of illumination simultaneously toggles the mood of the members of the minister’s flock, from the aggravation of making their way through the city to the church, then parking and finding a seat, to the exaltation of the service. It transitions the parishioners into a state of receptivity to the inspirational narratives and associative chains the sermon is meant to reawaken. The fins do double toggle duty, switching not only between perceptual effects but also between the perceptual level and the symbolic. This is indeed potentializing. But to a low degree of virtuality (like the hull), since it does not trigger a becoming. It confirms, or at most intensifies, the conventional definition and function of the space as a place of worship. It makes the church more “like” what it is (in contradistinction to the factory it was, and whose memory is preserved in the retrofitting design strategy). The operations of the fin separatrix, in its crowded religious gradient field, addresses established genre more than the generic in the emergent sense.
