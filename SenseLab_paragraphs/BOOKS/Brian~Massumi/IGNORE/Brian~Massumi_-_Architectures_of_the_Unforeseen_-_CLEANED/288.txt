Another possibility is that the mixing of media transposes the medium from the status of material support to that of immaterial result. Perhaps the unified effect, heterogeneously achieved, must itself be considered the medium of the creative process that produces it. In other words, the medium of relational architecture is just what it names, just what it dematerializingly “builds”: the event of fusion. Relation. The sweeping together of times; the zooming into each other of scales; the mating of levels; the pseudopod stretching of amoebic bodies; the arcing of tendencies across sense modalities; the reciprocal inflections of action, perception, and language; the potentially, collectively mutational meeting of all of these across a shared surface, or “interface,” in a state of mutual incipiency; the expressed -ability of this meeting.
