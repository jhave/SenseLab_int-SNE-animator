Both the gradient field and the particle are themselves internally differentiated: they are already relational (a consolidated alliance between rigidity and mass against an open differential of attractions and repulsions). The relation of which the movement is the visible expression is a relation between relations (running abstractly, prior to and outside the actual relations of the physical site-to-be). Operatively, what you see as a geometrically discrete particle moving against a background is an unfolding continuity of complex relation. The relationality is not itself visible. The form and its path of movement expresses invisible interactions of forces. The Euclidean geometry of the particle is secondary to the playing out of this abstract intensity. “Playing out” should be underlined: it takes time for the relationality to render its effect in the particle’s observed movement. This has to run. It must unfold. It is irreducibly durational. The architect is no longer designing primarily with visible form. She or he is designing with duration, rendered visible.xviii
