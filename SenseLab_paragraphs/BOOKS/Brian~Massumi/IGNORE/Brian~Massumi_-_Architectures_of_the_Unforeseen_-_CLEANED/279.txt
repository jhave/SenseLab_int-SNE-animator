Levels of action and perception donâ€™t just connect. They mate. The stoking of nascent action-perceptions by words is not an external connection, mediated by an interface, between distinct levels of organization and registers of experience. It is an immediate fusion of them, in infra-relation: the activation of a zone of indistinction between them. They merge into each other, share and exchange tendential properties in a kind of cultural meiosis, then reemerge, each to its own level, at a next unfolding. The levels accordion into each other, then telescope back out at the next beat. Their distinction is rhythmically reborn, step after step, next after last. Like every birth process, this rhythm of reappearance carries the potential for mutation.
