The installation makes human language visible at a rhythmic limit where it shades into a dimension of experience that is necessary to its workings but is not of its mode, since it is also the province of the bug. The work creates a visual analogue of human language, something “like” it, that reattaches it not only to a particular cultural evolution but also to the biosemiotic background from which it emerged.
