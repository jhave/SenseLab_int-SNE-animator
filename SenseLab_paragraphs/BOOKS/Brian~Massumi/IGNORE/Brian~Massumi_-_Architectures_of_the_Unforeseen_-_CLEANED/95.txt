The virtual can become the elusive object of a technology because it is itself as produced as it is given. Although it is not “in” any particular form expressing it, neither is it separable from its renderings. It is not outside and abstract in the transcendent sense. It is transpiring. It is the eventfulness of form: what repeatedly runs through it. It is only marginally better to think of the virtual in terms of information than it is to mistake it for Platonic transcendence. The virtual is not informational input or output. It is relational through-put. Since it cannot run-through without leaving traces of its passage, without taking formal effect, the virtual is as dependent for its return on the re-generation of form as form is dependent for its dynamism on the intensity of the virtual. Co-dependency. The virtual and its actual expression through form are wed in a symbiotic rhythm of return and regeneration.
