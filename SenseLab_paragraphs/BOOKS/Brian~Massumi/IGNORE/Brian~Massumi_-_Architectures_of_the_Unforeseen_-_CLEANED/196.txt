An affective pull of this kind places the body in a mode where activity and passivity interfuse. Being lured is not a fully intentional act on the part of a subject. But neither is it a passive surrender. The body lends itself to its being led. It actively surrenders to it, in the form of following. The body takes the lead of its own attraction, following the lure. What ensues is a collaboration between the body's appetition and the figure's beckoning. Activity and passivity fall into a a zone of indistinction. There is only one word for that zone: animatedness. Animate architecture doesn't have to make its constructions literally move, because even without them moving it can animate the body. The way this occurs requires, once again, rethinking what a body can be.
