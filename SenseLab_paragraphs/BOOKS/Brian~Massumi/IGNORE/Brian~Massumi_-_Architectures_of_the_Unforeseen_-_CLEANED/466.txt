The art of this inhabiting otherwise is also strongly procedural. The collecting of little nothings provides the template for its procedure. Venturing out with open-ended attentiveness, coming back, and then going over the harvested traces with an abstract movement. The abstract movement will not be the minimal one of counting. It will be the more taxing one of reexpressing, through the traces, the lived quality of befalling that recommended them for harvesting in the first place. It will be a re-tracing of their happenstantial allure in an artistic movement of abstraction. The reexpression, although not minimalist, must retain something of the economy and neutrality of collecting's counting procedure.
