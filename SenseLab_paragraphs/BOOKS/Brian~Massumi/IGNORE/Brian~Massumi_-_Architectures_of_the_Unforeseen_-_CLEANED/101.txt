The programmed gradient field described above comprises more than two relational sub-fields. There is always a possibility that when the particle approaches a threshold zone it will fly off chaotically rather than settling entropically into the strongest basin of attraction. Or it may hesitate at the threshold just enough to settle into in a weaker basin. This can be clearly seen on screen if instead of throwing in one particle, you throw in a whole mess of them: a particle cloud. The interaction gets impossibly complicated, because the masses of the mess of particles are interacting with each other as mini-gravitational fields in addition to each interacting with the ambient gradient field. When the rigid little creatures collide they bounce off each other in gaseous abandon. Every parameter is completely determined, yet the outcome retains an element of chaos.
