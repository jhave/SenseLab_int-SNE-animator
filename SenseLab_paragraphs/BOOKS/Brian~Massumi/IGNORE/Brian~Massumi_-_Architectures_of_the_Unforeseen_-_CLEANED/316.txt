Interactivity pertains to function: patterned circuits of response; a cycle of actual stimulus and actual response. Relation pertains to the material quality of the becoming body-event: a nascency of feelings-motions, edging each other, just barely felt, if actually at all, on the plane of their mutual inclusion, participating in each other as thought-signs of an event of the culturable kind, virtually stirring toward a coming to pass. On the interactive level, the technological apparatus is mediating: it interposes its stimulus between one response and the next. Relation, on the other hand, is immediate: so fully that it fails actually to register in its full stretch. Relation is and remains infra-. Interactivty is the manner in which the infra- actually peaks. Interactivity remains on the level of possible reaction. Relation is the dimension of potentiating activation. Interactivity is connective: to the apparatus, and of participants across their mediated reactions to the apparatus. Relation is fusional: it mates a heterogeneity levels (including that of interaction itself). Bodies interact as what they are: from the angle of their acquired competencies and habits. Bodies relate from the angle of their life -ability to modulate what they will be : to continue to become, in an act of culture in the remaking. Only a theory of immediation can give this culturing its due.
