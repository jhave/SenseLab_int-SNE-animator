Each cultural act exemplifies the change-ability of the domain of culture. It makes felt the cultural domain's lived reality as a collective event-"space" for companion acts of variation to gather. Each cultural act virtually populates the present of performance with cultural differencings in potential relay. The pluripotence of the act makes "the" body performing it already several: in reality, a virtual group. A gregarity. The kinesthetic amoeba, gone culturing, extends itself to its own company. Lozano-Hemmer's works set the stage for tele-embodyments of this relational culturing.
