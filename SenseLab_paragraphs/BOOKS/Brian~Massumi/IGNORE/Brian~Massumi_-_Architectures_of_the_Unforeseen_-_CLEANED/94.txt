“Duration,” is another word for the virtual on the run, in the direction of the emergence of the new. Visible form is now in the service of the virtual. Its calling is to actualize the virtual in movement: to render it dynamically (so very different from representing it). Architectural design is not simply using new a tool, “virtual” technology. It is keying directly into the reality of the virtual, in all its self-differing continuity and elusive abstractness. Architecture is rendering itself a technology of the virtual.
