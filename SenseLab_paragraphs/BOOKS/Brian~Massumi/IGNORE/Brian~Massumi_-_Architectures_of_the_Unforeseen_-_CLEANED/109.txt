Now put a gaggle of blobs in a gradient field and let the program run. The blobs will stretch around each other like amorous slugs. Some will fuse, forming pluri-chambered bulbous structures or tubulations. What collective shape arises from their deformational congress cannot be predicted with accuracy. The blobs do not only mutually deform. Their reciprocal transformation is itself inflected by the surrounding gradient field. Relation of relation. Interrelation to the second power: greater complexity, increased unforeseeability. Stop the program. The visible shape you are left with is a processual emergence from the relationally unforeseen.
