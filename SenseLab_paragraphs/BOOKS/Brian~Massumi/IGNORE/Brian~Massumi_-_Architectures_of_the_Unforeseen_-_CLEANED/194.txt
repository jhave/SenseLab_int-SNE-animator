The decorative effect of the machined tool paths is most wrapped up with color (yet another fusion). The process has returned, in processual analogy (as opposed to imitation and metaphor), to something that is found in "almost any plant or animal pattern," namely: "a correspondence between a change in surface and a change in pattern and texture. The pattern is neither simply projected nor applied, nor is it gridded and extrapolated. The pattern and texture is intensive to the shape. This fusion of shape, color, and texture into a synthetic and mutually expressive continuity has been our ambition for the use of color and materials ever since."lxxxi This new extension of expressive continuity into a play between color and machine-tooled texture has been deployed in Lynn's work across the board at every scale, from the Alessi tea sets to the building complex of the Ark of the World (2002-2003). The co-belonging of these projects to the same architectural matrix is betokened in the official name of the Alessi designs: the Alessi Tea and Coffee Towers (2003) and the Alessi Tea and Coffee Piazza (2000).lxxxii
