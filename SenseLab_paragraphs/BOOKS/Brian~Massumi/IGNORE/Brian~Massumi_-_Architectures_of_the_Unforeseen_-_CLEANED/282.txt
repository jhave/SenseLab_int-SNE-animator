Potential for mutation: that’s the point. Lozano-Hemmer’s work plays on this multidirectional, pluripotent meiotic fusing of levels of reality to make felt the potential for change. There is no particular political program advanced. The work is not “political” in the sense of sending a specific message or militating for a particular ideology. At the same time, political issues and problems of urbanism are insistently brought into play, becoming part of the concept design of each event.
