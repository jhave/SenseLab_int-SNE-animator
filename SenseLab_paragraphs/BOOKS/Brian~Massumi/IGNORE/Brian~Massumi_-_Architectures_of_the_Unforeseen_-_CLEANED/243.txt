the body appears as a somewhat shapeless mass or volume. There is very little by way of internal organization or connection between the parts. ... Instead of any precise line of demarcation we find a number of regions with extensive connections between them gradually merging into one another. We can with some justification look on the body as a sort of kinesthetic amoeba, a perpetually changing mass with loose connections between the parts, and with the limbs constituting the pseudopodia. ... The “volume” of which the body consists is not limited by a clearly defined surface, and there is no “contour.” ... It necessarily follows that the whole of the kinesthetic field of bodily sensations is filled by the body. ... There can be no question of any distinction between figure and ground ... The limit of the body is like the limit of the visual field – an imprecise frontier with no line of demarcation.vii
