The problem is finding a right way: one that does not bring back the wrong questions, that avoids triggering responses in others that return to conventions of commentary-about. The artist confesses that she struggles with the urge to just dump together the things she has gleaned from her art procedure for living, in the same way her little nothings were unceremoniously dumped. After all, her little nothings led her to her small epiphanies. Won't a second dumping do the same for the visitors to the artwork?
