Simondon calls this the body’s charge of “preindividual reality.”ix “Infraindividual” is even better because Simondon's “pre-” is not a marker of chronological order. The surplus charge of becoming accompanies each step’s performance, and feeds forward across the stepped series it helps compose. The preindividual is less a separate instant in a linear chronology than an accompanying dimension of reality’s formation internal to each’s moment’s coming to be. The body continually folds fusionally back into the infraindividual dimension of its dynamic reality at the same time as its life’s steps  stretch out into the individuality of their occurring. This process doubles the phenomenal body with the dynamic form of its becoming.
