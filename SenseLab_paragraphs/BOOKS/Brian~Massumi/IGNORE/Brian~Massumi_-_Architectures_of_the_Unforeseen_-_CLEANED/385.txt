Volo≈°inov famously distinguishes the "theme" of language from semantic content. The difference is that theme is singularly marked by the noisy "whole" to which it emergently belongs.xlviii The particular "evaluative accent," or affective tonality, with which a speech act crests qualitatively marks its constitutive belonging to that ever-changing whole.xlix The evaluative accent is performed, not just signified. It is always performed extra-syntactically (in tone or rhythm), and often extraverbally (in gesture or facial expression).l The whole to which a language act emergently belongs is infra: infra-present, infra-individual, infra-cognitive, infra-determinate meaning. In "Amodal Suspension" the event of language is incipiently enacted at a more expansively formative level than it is individually understood. It amoebates, but without reaching so close to the cosmic limit as to fall beyond the zone of indistinction between the human and the animal, toward, for example, a becoming vegetable or mineral. These dimensions cannot but be in-forming of the act, but the predominance of grasping at words keeps them  distantly backgrounded.
