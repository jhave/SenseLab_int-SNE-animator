The keyword for surface in Lynn's approach is intricacy.lxx The way in which the relationship between the waving hand-elements of the stadium-wave and the wave's own dynamic form was described earlier provides a gateway to this concept. The wave, it was said, folds the activity of the hands into its own going on. The dynamic form of the wave folds the multiplicity of its constituent sub-wavings into its own occurrence. The overwave's continuous propagation takes up the diversity of the hand-wavings into itself, smoothing over their discreteness. The multiplicity of the hands, the individual of each absorbed into its own gesture, is resorbed into the singularity of the wave. The wave as a whole arises as a fusion of its parts. On their level and in their own materiality, the hands remain discrete. But what is seen, in all immediacy, on the abstract surface of perception, is the global effect of their integration. The unfolding of the effect effectively guides the continuing of the wave's formation, as audience members follow its movement and fall in with it. The effect is felt, nonsensuously, in the register of affect. And it is felt as in some way beautiful. It is an aesthetic effect. The important processual point is that the aesthetic effect of the wave is not separate from its formation. That is to say, it is not separate from the technique by which the wave is composed (in this case, "entrainment"). Not only do the parts fuse into their whole, but the aesthetic plane collapses into the activity of the formative field. The point of collapse, where aesthetic effect and form-generation fuse, is on a par with the deployment of technique. "Intricacy's visual sensibility emerges from technique rather than figuration or content."lxxi
