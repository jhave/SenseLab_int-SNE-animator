In its own way, this leads back to the idea of filiation. The successive iterations that spring from a recursive return to a generative matrix are processual siblings. An absolute origin expresses itself in recursive filiation. Lynn adopted recursive filiation in his Embryological House Project (1998-1999). As it settled into his practice as a favored technique, he began to speak in terms of families of forms.xciii The siblings composing families of form come in litters. Rather than concentrating on one form and continuing its variation, the matrix is made to self-iterate right off the bat, running out batches.xciv A profusion of forms exfoliates in one iterative stroke, exploring large swathes of potential permutations. For the Embryological House, large numbers of permutants were produced.xcv Once the permutations are born, individual litter-mates that seem particularly proto-architecturally convivial to a wedding with forces of the outside (such as site conditions), and in a way favorable to the program, may then be remanded to a continuing topological evolution. Alliance cannot exist without some form of filiation, for the simple reason that it needs populating. There needs to be a generation of elements of alliance. The absolute origin of recursive filiation is the form of filiation adequate to the generosity of outside alliance. It constitutes a movement of filiative involution conditioning the unfolding of the allianced evolution of forms.xcvi
