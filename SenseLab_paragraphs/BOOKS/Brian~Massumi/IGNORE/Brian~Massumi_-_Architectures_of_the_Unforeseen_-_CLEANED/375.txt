The cultural act hangs between two limits, with respect to which it moves following two inverse but coincident movements. Following one, it achieves human particularity, positioned on the cultural map vis-Ã -vis other acts similarly cresting into their specificity. At this proximate limit of peaking into position, the cultural act is interactive in the sense defined above. It participates in a back-and-forth of call-and-response the aim of which is to transmit messages between positions on the map with minimum noise and maximum security against third-party poaching and collective drift. To the extent that separate human agency is attributed to the individual senders, this communicational interaction is intersubjective. Intersubjective communication is the human limit of the cultural act: its human extremity, the extremity of the cultural becoming of the human. The coordinates of communicational activity are now intersubjectively inscribed and recognized. The flipside of this recognizability is the imperative to own up to one's actions. The owning-up holds a body to position on the intersubjective grid. The cultural territory is now striated with two-party lines of person-to-person message emission and reception. The noise of culturability's folding in and out, accordioning a cosmic continuum, is muffled. The noise-laden latitude of emergent variation is restricted to set intersubjective channels of communication. At its human limit, the cultural domain snaps to grid.
