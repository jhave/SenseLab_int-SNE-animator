Now, shift focus. Think of an architectural surface, a wall say. Everything that was said of the stadium-wave can be said of the events that compose themselves in and around the walls of the building. Inside the building lies the open, differential, intensive field of inhabition, composed of an infinity of conditioning factors â€“ habit, desire, physiological needs, convention, furnishings, equipment, embedded media systems, and so forth ad infinitum. Not just hands, but a mixed bag of elements of all natures. Outside the building lies another open, differential, intensive field, of the urban. This field is composed of factors such as zoning, patterns of circulation and frequentation, noise, community facilities, collective equipment, policing, and norms of interaction. Another mixed bag, many-handed and more. The architectural surface folds these open fields into and out of each other, producing all manner of body events on the abstract surface of habitation. This folding in and out is the intensive matter of architecture. Walls, roofs, and floors compose the extensive surface visibly doubling the abstract body-events of inhabitation.
