Where territorialization and deterritorialization come together is in "bare activity." Bare activity was defined as the material quality of the event: its bodily dimension. In bare activity is where the particular body shades back into the kinesthetic amoeba it always is at the incipient level of its every moving act. The body's bare activity occurs in a zone of indistinction between thinking and feeling. The various modalities of sensuous experience fuse with each other, and together enter into "amodal" resonance with the "higher forms" of determination characterizing the cultural act, as they feed back to and through the emergent level. The cultural act is infused with the material quality of its event. Its event, therefore, is integrally bodily. In the event, the body may "stretch" beyond its scale. It may expand to the length of meadow, touch a façade on its own a monumental scale, factor in a technological apparatus of immense complexity and heterogeneous composition, and take in or take on the planetary dimensions of the worldwide web. In bare activity, as the life of the body accordians into its expanded field of emergence, it telescopes out-of-scale, becoming in-formed by levels well beyond its own. This is the material quality of experience becoming cosmic. At this extreme point of expansive deterritorialization, the human body is in a zone of indistinction with nonhuman levels – extending through the biological into the inorganic, from meadow to metal, in wire and across concrete – with which its life is formatively imbricated. The out-of-scaleness of the nonhuman levels with which it enters, regerminally, into fusion give the act a cosmic dimension.xlvi
