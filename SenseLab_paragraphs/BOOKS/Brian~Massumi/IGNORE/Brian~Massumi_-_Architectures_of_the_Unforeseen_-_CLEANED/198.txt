In the event, the body is acting as a flesh-and-blood cursor, incrementally refreshing the figure's integral appearing, adding a flickering variation to its expression. The body's  movement coincides with the recomposition of the figure, in a live iteration. The moving body becomes one with the composition of the figure. The interfusion of activity and passivity conditions a transfusion between the body and the figure, as they operative overlap in the zone of indistinction. The life of the body extends, through the medium of the affective atmosphere swaddling the figure, toward the concrete surface of the construction. The concrete surface describes the limit of the event: the point beyond which the body's extension does not penetrate, deflected instead into lateral movement following the topological spread of the figure's undulations. The figure, for its part, is reanimated â€“ brought back to compositional life in a further iteration continuing its formation. This two-way movement of mutual extension is a transductive relation. The figure folds out into the life of the body, as the body's movement is infolded into the composition of the figure, becoming a formative force for its animate form.
