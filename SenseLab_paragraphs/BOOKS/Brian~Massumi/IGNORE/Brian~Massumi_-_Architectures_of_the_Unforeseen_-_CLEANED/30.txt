In a word, this is a speculative undertaking. On the philosophical side, it is when the conceptual texture reaches the limit of its consistency, where the mutual relevance of the concepts reaches a pitch of reciprocal presupposition, that the working-through of the constitutive problems is at its intensest and the movement of thought returns  to its own singularity. Each concept is carried beyond the limit of its own meaning, into the collective texture of what is indefinable in the others, and all together. At this collective limit, they flicker out of the overlap with the nonphilosophical practices with which they have worked in symbiosis, to resonate intensely together, in a fit of self-reference. In that intensity of self-reference, the descriptive, or exo-referential, function of the writing blinks out.
