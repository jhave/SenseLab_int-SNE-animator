Publicly, acts of language do not intensely express; they judiciously "represent." What they represent is the socially recognized position occupied by the private person vis-à-vis socially acceptable others after its own segregated kind. Rules of decorum place the public expression at a polite remove, maintaining a safe distance between "inner personalities." A slightly expanded circle draws itself around the individual, allowing for intersubjective communication that remains restricted enough to still be considered "private" from the regulatory point of view of the public sphere: the circle of the family, or the circle of friends. Such social circles are segregated spheres for the representation of the inner personality to more or less intimate others. What remnants remain of the formative, bare-active intensity of expression is allowed a restricted expression within the concentric circles of the private. There, it manifest as "moods," quirks of personality, and private pathologies – subjective inflections of expression whose public broadcast would be improper. The pseudopods of expression retract, and pathologically wither. The virtual immensity of expression contracts to the size of an "I" whose uprightness is now shadowed by what will be figured as the personal unconscious: stagnant repository of inwardly impelled thought-signs of undecorous tendency.
