Two separate minds are not requisite for the operation of a sign. Thus the premisses of an argument are a sign of the truth of the conclusion; yet it is essential to argument that the same mind that thinks the conclusion as such should also think the premisses. Indeed, two minds in communication are, in so far, "at one," that is, are properly one mind in that part of them. That being the understood, the answer to the question will go to recognize every sign, -- or, at any rate, nearly every one, -- is a determination of something of the general nature of a mind, which we may call a "quasi-mind."lxxix
