If the earlier works were in the element of culturability, the element of "Amodal Suspension" is sociability: the reaching-toward language of relation, freed from the finalities of interaction. "Element" is used here in a slightly different sense than when it was said that bare activity was the element of the body, with an accent of "the elements" in the weather sense. The difference might be thought of as the difference between the elements and the prevailing visibility conditions. The element of a relational act is a kind of lensing through which the integrality of the relational field is refracted through its material quality, giving the processual span of the coming act a focal length setting its constitutive limits. The element is the refractive angle by which the relational field folds into the act's coming to its own expression as the manner of event it stages (as medium of expression).li It might be said to be the manner of the event's potential, as opposed to the manner of the act's performance of that potential. In "Amodal Suspension," language -ability is socially refracted.
