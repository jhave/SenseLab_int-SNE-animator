Now return to the screen of the digital design process as earlier described. The screen is also a concrete double of the form-taking events passing through it. Properly speaking, these events occur on the abstract surface of topological transformation – purely abstract affectings and being affected, folding into and out of each other geometrically. The resulting animated figures are visible doubles of abstract bodies. A blob is not a metaphor for a body: a blob is a body. It is an abstract body, visibly expresssing itself in pixels, arising from an interplay of abstract formative forces operating in a virtual differential field. The abstract body is the manner in which the virtual field –which in and of itself is recessive in relation to experience, as discussed in the opening sections of this essay – comes out into experience. It is the actualization of the virtual: the nonsensuous image of that which has none.lv
