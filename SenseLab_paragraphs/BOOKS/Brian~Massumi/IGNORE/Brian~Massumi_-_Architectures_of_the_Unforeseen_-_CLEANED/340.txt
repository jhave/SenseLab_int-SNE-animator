“Third” parties never come in ones. Where there’s one third, there’s bound to be another down the noisy line. Three’s a crowd again. But this time the triadic multiplicity separates human language back out, returning it to its proper mode. Lozano-Hemmer’s installation also makes visible the rearising or reemergence of specifically human communication, in its first flush, or flash, seen for what it is: a nonlinear crowd phenomenon. The rising community of poachable beams is Lozano-Hemmer’s visual analogue of what he calls the chaotic “social soup” of many-party thirdness: a literal flash mob.
