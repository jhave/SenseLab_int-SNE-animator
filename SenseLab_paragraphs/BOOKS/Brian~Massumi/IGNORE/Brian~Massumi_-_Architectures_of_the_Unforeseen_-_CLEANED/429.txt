The intensely participatory nature of electronic-art practices such as Lozano-Hemmer's relational architecture give us an option not open to Peirce or Volo≈°inov: the option of not "arguing" the points. Rather, experiencing them. In fusion and out-of-scale, in two-way movement toward the present limits of experience's futurity. It gives us the option of experimenting with them, as never before. Of enactively speculating on them. Of living the next step, eventfully. Even if, now or ultimately, that step is in the direction of a crucial existential turning point beyond the bend of the event. Up until that point, whether or however it may be humanly reachable, we can save ourselves the embarrassment of futurist argument, and instead live the futurity in the event, beyond itself.
