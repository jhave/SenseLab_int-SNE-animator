Performatively speaking, words do not represent visual perceptions or reflect general ideas associated with them. Words are perceptions, of a very special kind. A most striking demonstration of this is provided by the phenomenon of blindsight. People with blindsight have been shown to see unconsciously. For example, patients will not be able to see a cup on the table in front of them, but if asked to pick it up will do so without missing a beat. They retain the ability of vision to relay into a next step. They have the “nextness” dimension of visual perception without the visual perception. This is particularly telling when patients are shown words on flash cards. The follow-up step reveals that they not only see the words without seeing them – they read them without seeing them.xii Patients are often only blindsighted in one area of their visual field. If their field of sight is shown a word with more than one meaning, like “bank,” and their blindsight spot is shown another word reducing the ambiguity, like “money” or “river,” their direct understanding of the perceived word will be modulated by the blindseen card. Their next response is oriented one way or the other. This suggests that there is a dimension of word use that imparts orientation or tendency-to in immediate perception – so immediate it needn’t even register in feeling otherwise than in its effects.
