The result of this approach is a streamlining of architectural design, as the fusions and continuings-across discussed at many a turn in this account are telescoped into even greater processual solidarity. This streamlining accounts for the enormous range of Lynn's design activities, which have become so various that it is difficult to give them their due in an essay of this length. What might be mistaken for eclecticism is in fact a sign of increasing robustness, born of tighter cross-consistency among formative factors and techniques. The generalized focus on fusion is literalized as Lynn has moved toward the use of high-performance composite materials. These materials, used most notably in aeronautics and boat design, are physically produced through techniques of fusion. A whole new "composite paradigm" replaces the traditional tectonic paradigm.xcix The composite paradigm is characterized by "a shift from assemblage to fusion" in terms of the basic logic informing the process, down to the basic production of the materials in which the design will concretize itself.c With fusion, approached recursively, comes fissionability. Any element, form, or technique can become an reentry point into the form-generating process, providing a virtual infinity of angles of variational return to the accompanying origin, multiplying design flexibility many-fold.
