Perhaps performative arts, arts of the event, have as their medium the manner of event they stage – in this case events of relation. If so, they are in the odd, and oddly powerful, position of creating the medium of their expression in and as the very act of expression. The medium happens. It is summoned by its own unfolding event. The medium itself is ephemeral and emergent. This is the mark of the “occurrent arts.”xxix
