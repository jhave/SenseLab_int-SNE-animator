Lynn's proposition is less that topological architecture is a new kind of architecture. It is that architectural process is topological, always and everywhere, from generative top to bottom, field to field, program to genre. As a design practice, it is always in the business of in-folding forces of its outside, feeding on generative field conditions more radically open than any exterior defined relative to a structurally defined interior. The discipline of architecture is naturally allied to complex, self-organizing phenomena of a proto-architectural kind, regardless of what discipline or domain they are native to.lxi Explicitly topological architecture is just this natural tendency, of infolding for folding-out, coming into its own, enabled by new tools and abetted by alternative geometries. The topological in architecture is "facilitated" by the tools of the digital but "not simply reducible to" them.lxii
