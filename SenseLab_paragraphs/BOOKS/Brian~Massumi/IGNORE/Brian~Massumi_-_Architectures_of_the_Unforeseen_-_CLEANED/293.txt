There is only one word for the kind of acts staged in the works of Lozano-Hemmer under discussion here: cultural acts. The specific way in which the stage is set for the act and the manner in which it is performed activates a spectrum of relation into which any number of things factor together. Alien historical memories as close as plague pillar and far-reaching as colonialism rub shoulders with memories of the urban future. The vampirism of the established urban power regime hits up against proto-political stirrings of resistance to it. To name a few. This mutual factoring into the act of that which constitutively exceeds it forms its historically inflected relational neighborhood: the cultural domain it inhabits. The vicinity of the artwork is not simply the city neighborhood in which the art is installed. Processually speaking, the art act's vicinity is the region of relation it contracts into itself and brings to expression.
