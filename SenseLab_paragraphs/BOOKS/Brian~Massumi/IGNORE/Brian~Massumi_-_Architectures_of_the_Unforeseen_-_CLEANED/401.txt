It was not take long, however, before this self-stultifying achievement of culturability against itelf to come to be felt as the deadening it is. It is not so long before Debord and Baudrillard, to name the most prominent examples, proclaim the achievement of de-nature-cultured society as, paradoxically, marking the "end of the social."lviii All it took was for the mass media to bring "transparency" to public communication for "society" to audio-visibly implode into its emptiness of "theme" â€“ its voiding of that "extra something that converts the word into a whole utterance"lix expansively implete with cultural-difference regenerating potential running all the way to the cosmic limit of nature. That "extra something" rides the waves of the murmurous sea-swell of third-party noise in the lines of communication. "Amodal Suspension" brings it to a flashpoint, from a certain processual angle that counters the segregation of culture from society in its own paradoxical way: by bringing sociability as such to expression, off-set from culturability by different constitutive limits. Not segregating it, but refracting it, in the element of the reaching for language.
