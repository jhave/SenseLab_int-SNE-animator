We are speaking, of course, of curvilinear surface. A curvilinear surface, in the process of becoming-architectural, is neotenous. Even lifted out of the series of topological iterations to which it belongs to feature as a stand-alone figure, it retains many of its proto-formal embryonic characteristics. It has a natural tendency to resist such traditional properties of architectural form as the frontality of the fa√ßade, the structural dichotomy between vertical load-bearing and horizontal elevation, the encasement of a volume by an assemblage of figurally and structurally discrete elements (walls, floors, and roof with clear lines of demarcation between them), modular massing by the accretion of figurally and structurally discrete elements, the rigid volumetric division of inside from outside, the dressing of a surface with cladding, and the overdressing of ornament. All of these distinctions can be topologically smoothed over into lines of continuous variation, making every element a dependent variable in integral co-composition.lxviii This erases what is perhaps the master distinction undergirding not only the typical understandings of architectural form, but almost all classical and modern practices and philosophies of form as well: the structural contrast between the part and the whole.lxix
