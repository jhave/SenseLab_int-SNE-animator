As we learned with the stadium-wave, the dynamic form of the transfusional surface effect can be considered with no exaggeration to be a body. The abstract architectural surface itself is a nonhuman body â€“ an examplar of what in his earlier work Lynn would have called an "inorganic body."lxxxiv The concrete surface of the construction provides an enduring take-off site for the iterative taking-form of ephemeral architectural-body effects. It becomes a storage site for the varying repetition of ephemeral body-events. The notion of dynamic form as involving the perceptual perfusion of the abstract surface in a transductive zone of interfusion was already implicit in the example of the stadium-wave through which the concept of the architectural body-event was developed earlier, as well as in the statement that blobs carrying on on screen, in the unseeemly manner to which they are accustomed, qualify as bodies. Manner is a key word. There are all manner of bodies, concrete or physical (bounded, volumetric, corpuscular) and noncorpuscular or abstract (superficial, energetic). There is an asymmetry in the "and." Physical bodies, as Simondon said, live at their limit:lxxxv where they peak onto an abstract surface whose matter is affect. In this sense, abstract-surface bodies can be said to envelop physical bodies, in affective wrapping.
