The first thing to remark is that the stadium wave is a gesture, and that it is expressive (of excitement). The second thing to remark is that its expression is self-propagating: it feeds off of its own momentum. Each roll of the wave folds the impulse inherited from the last and relays it forward, the expressed intensity mounting toward a crescendo. Who is the subject of the wave? There is no one. A single individual is not capable of starting it. More than one is required. The wave originates between existing bodies. It occurs when a number of bodies collectively launch themselves into correlated movements of their hands, in a kind of unspoken alliance that coincides with the event of the wave's taking effect, and does not survive its run. There is no subject of the wave, other than the event of the wave itself. This is a body-event: one only with its own taking dynamic form.
