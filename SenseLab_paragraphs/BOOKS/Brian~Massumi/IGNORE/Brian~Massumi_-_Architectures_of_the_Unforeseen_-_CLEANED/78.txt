As we will see, in Lynn’s practice things are too unregulated and get too involuted to maintain a signifying remove. The whole notion of an “interiority” of architecture falls away in operative, or in Lynn’s vocabulary “performance”-based, continuity with its outside (historical, social, personal, gravitational, whatever). What traces there are, are in effect (following the process).ix Deprived of an anteriority and interiority of architecture, the critical practitioner is barking at the wind: there is nothing to deconstruct. This brings up a point that will be important later. Without a dialectical relation to an “inside,” the “outside” must be integrally reconceived as in some sense absolute, “like” the undistancing figure of continuity through whose vagaries it comes into processual proximity with the “inside.” Which by now is something else again. It is not absolute. Nor is it supplemental in Eisenman’s Derridean sense. It is just plain provisional, nothing more glorious than gerry-rigged. Kiss dramatic mastery goodbye. All the world’s a gambol. Relax, go with the flow. If you can’t master presence, you might as well follow process (and love it). Trace away, mouse happily in hand.x
