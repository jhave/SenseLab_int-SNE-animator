It gets even stranger when you consider that although it is unbounded, it is not unlimited. I have referred at several points to the “same” topological figure. Given its anomalous, untypical nature, how do you tell when it is no longer itself? The answer was staring at us from the beginning: the identity of a topological figure is defined by its continuity. Cut it, and it ceases to be itself. Puncture it, and it is not what it used to be. For example, if you take the all-suffering sphere and punch a hole through it, you get a torus or tire-shape. You can twist and turn and stretch and compress the torus and get a coffee-cup. You have entered a different topological space inhabited by a different population of forms. You have a new multiply-singular generic teaming with members of the ideal classes of coffee-cups and tires.
