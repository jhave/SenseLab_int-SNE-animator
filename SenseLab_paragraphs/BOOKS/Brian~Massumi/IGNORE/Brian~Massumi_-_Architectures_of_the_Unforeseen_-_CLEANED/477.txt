Small epiphany: Here Art Grows on Trees. Nice title â€“ but what does it mean? Wrong question again. It's not easy to keep the wrong questions from coming back. That's why procedure is so important. Think trigger. What does this trigger? That's the right question. But that question cannot be answered in isolation. What  the jambu triggered in place, over the cliff, is one little thing. But what it might trigger displaced, its drawing-in brought together with that of other collected elements of the artwork in formation, is another question entirely. When all of them come together in Venice to inhabit together their mutual displacement, it is certain that very different things will trigger. The drawings-in will mutually refract, as each other's elsewheres. Outback Australia, urban Australia, peninsular Malaysia, and Venice will cross to singular effect, all depending on the way in which they are reexpressively brought together. To retrace places with their elsewheres is not to squarely reproduce what happened on site. It is to obliquely renew takings-account of each other, remaking their relation take place here.
