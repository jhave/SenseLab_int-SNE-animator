Lozano-Hemmer entitled this shadow work “Re:Positioning Fear” and named the interface “Tele-absence,” “defined as the technological acknowledgement of the impossibility of self transmission ... the celebration of where and when the body is not.”ii If you think of the shadow in the way just suggested, as casting “absence” as a potential next action, the “where and when the body is not” becomes “where the body may relay,” and “the impossibility of self transmission” becomes a reminder that every stretch of the body is not just a spatial displacement of it but a becoming. A body cannot transmit itself. But it can project its vitality. Its activity may take on new dimension. Seen in this way, “tele-absence” is perhaps not so different from “telembodyment,” the term relayed into in later work of Lozano-Hemmer.
