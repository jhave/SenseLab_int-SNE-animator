The reason why the foregoing account of Lynn's practice placed so much emphasis on the body, acknowledging that it explicitly falls out of the picture all the while charting the ways it continues silently to accompany it, is that the body-event is the port of entry for the political. It is threshold over which the always-already immanence of the political might be given a renewed processual welcome. Extending that welcome would amount to a significant transduction of Lynn's design process, adding a major twist to it that would deform its ethical performance envelope to extend its parameters.
