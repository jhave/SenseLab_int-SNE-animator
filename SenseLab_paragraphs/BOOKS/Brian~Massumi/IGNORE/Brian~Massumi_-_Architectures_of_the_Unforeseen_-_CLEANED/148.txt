Lynn declines to follow the perceptual path as his main avenue, for fear that a foundational subject might contrive to return through topological architecture's back door, vitating his move toward animante form. Where he goes instead is toward surface on the one hand, and toward performance on the other. Either way, bodies are most welcome â€“ provided a non-Cartesian and nonphenomenological notion of what constitutes a body can be conceived and operationalized. Lynn does not lack a concept of the body. In fact, the reconceptualization of the body was a central concern of his all along, as evidenced in his very earliest writings. The title of the collection of his essays from the 1990s makes this centrality clear in the very placement of the word: Folds, Bodies, & Blobs.xlvi
