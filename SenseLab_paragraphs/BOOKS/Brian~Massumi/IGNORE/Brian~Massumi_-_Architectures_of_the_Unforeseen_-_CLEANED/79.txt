If Lynn’s architecture is hard to distinguish from either Eisenman’s or other architects’, modern or contemporary, it will be of little concern for Lynn. If you follow process, architectural differentiation is no longer fundamentally a question of styles and their typology. Lynn has no need to assert his presence on the stylistic level, as a critically distant master of conventional form “overcome.” For him, it is no longer a question of genre but of the generic (the hypertypological).
