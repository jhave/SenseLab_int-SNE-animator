The stopping problem is a continuing problem. If you answer the question of when, why, and how to stop the process running in order to render a form, you are immediately faced with the problem of how to make the process continue again across its stoppage. When you want station, you are faced with a runaway process. When you want to continue the process, you are confronted with a static form. No one ever said that animating architecture would be easy.
