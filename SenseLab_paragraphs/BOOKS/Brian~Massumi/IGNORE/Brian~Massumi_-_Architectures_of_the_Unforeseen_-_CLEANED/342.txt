There is a third mechanism of meaning interference built into the installation: translation. Messages could be entered in English or Japanese. If for example a message entered in Japanese is poached by a third party using English, the message is automatically translated using an off-the-shelf automatic translating software system widely used on the Web at the time (Systranâ€™s Sherlock). As anyone who has used an internet translating feature knows, automatic translation is not a very advanced art. Errors inevitably slip in, often to comic effect. Using automatic translation in this context brings interference into the very heart of the message, again frustrating the possibilty of transparent communication. The linear transmission of message content is scrambled, in a technologically assisted version of the telephone game.
