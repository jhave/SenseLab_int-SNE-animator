In the complexity of this process, novel effects can arise, through resonance or interference between the fields. On-the-fly improvisations may produce new variations, playing on the fusional multiplicity of conditioning factors that peak into architectural gestures of inhabitation. Body-events that cannot be clearly demarcated as either domestic or urban can emerge from this. A building's program can be supplemented – outdone by itself – by these emergent expressions. Architectural-body events (or architectural body-events) are always happening at any rate, each in their own way, on their own scale, duplexing their own crowd of formative elements. Their novelty may be more visible in nonstandard architectural constructions, they also occur in buildings belonging to traditional architectural genres, such as the sports stadium or single-family home. Body-events can take off anywhere – and do so in profusion, on all scales.liii
