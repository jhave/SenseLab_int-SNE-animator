Expert at “reading” what is “written” in visual form, the critical architect is required to be painfully literate. The virtually affirmative architect,xix on the other hand, is encouraged to be abundantly iterate. The critical architect, feeling tradition-bound and hating it, is challenged by perceived strictures (given structures). The affirmative architect, operating with joyful abandon in an open relational field, is challenged by the plethora of invisible procedural possibilities to surpass the given. This leads to a novel problem, one that is entirely different from the problem of being bound by tradition. It is a directly processual problem, what in computer parlance is called the “stopping problem.” The regenerative process can be repeated endlessly, to different effect. So how do you know when to stop? Which effect is the “right” one? What criteria can you apply to a process that is so incomparably open and elusive that it continually defies set categories? How do you judge something that offers no self-justification other than its own runaway appeal? Granted, you love it. But can you stop tweaking already and choose?
