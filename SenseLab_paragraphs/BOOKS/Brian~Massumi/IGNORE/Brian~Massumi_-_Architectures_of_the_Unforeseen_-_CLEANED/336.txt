To see the latent content, the addressee must “grab” the message from the beaming crowd as she would a pluck a point of light from a summer cloud of fireflies. This is done by clicking on the beam on the real-time website simulation of the event, or on-site by cell phone by entering the number of the tower currently carrying the message. To access the coded content, the participant must perform a digital analogue of gesture, beckoning delivery of the meaning content. And it has to be done fast. As the soon as the message is grabbed, the beam abruptly disappears. If someone beats them to it, they receive a message informing them of the name and location of the poacher. The message can still be accessed from the public log archived on the server.
