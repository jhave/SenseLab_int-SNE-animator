In this alternate view, noise is as constitutive of the signal as its code. The following discussion of this conception of noise is based on Aden Evens' analysis in Sound Ideas. The book is primarily about music, but its discussion of sound and noise is written to apply as well to language – as it must. For the line between music and language is another of the zones of indistinction belonging to language’s field of emergence. Language meets multiplicity in thirdness, it meets body and animality in gesture – and it meets music in sound and rhythm, and in the fact that it shares sound’s own emergent relation to noise.
