The stadium-wave is an architectural body-event that does not have an inside or an outside, only a rhythm appearing on an abstract surface. In this sense, it retains its proto-architectural nature, at the price of exhausting itelf in its own ephemerality. It has an architectural becoming, with no concrete architecture become. It is embryonic architecture. Mature architectural forms, architectures in the finished, standing sense, take becoming-architectural to a concrete conclusion, doubling the abstract surface of expression with a material surface (a surface of another matter). In all cases, becoming-architectural involves a coming to integral expression of a multiplicity of formative forces differentially inhabiting open generative fields. The expression is always on an abstract surface, which in certain becomings-architectural (the kind that are actually built) is doubled by a concrete surface. The abstractness of this surface of expression as such qualifies Lynn's architecture as exactly what he says it is: not a formalism, but an abstract expressionism.liv
