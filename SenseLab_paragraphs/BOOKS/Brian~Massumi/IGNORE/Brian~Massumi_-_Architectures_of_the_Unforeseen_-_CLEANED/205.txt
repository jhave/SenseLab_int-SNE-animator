As earlier noted, Lynn's project for a processual architecture of animate, or dynamic, form erases the notion of the origin. The process is iterative, returning serially to the same generative matrix (most broadly, that of topological transformation, as underwritten by differential calculusxc). For each serial unfolding, forces of the outside are folded into the matrix, as instantiated in the generative field as it composes for the coming iteration. The differentials composing the field are disposed in such a way as to energize the matrix with a certain vectorial orientation (toward the issuing into actions within a performance envelope, or to put it in more directly, remaining within certain operational parameters). The in-folded forces thus fold back out in proto-architectural form, to meet their cousins in the wider world and interfuse with them (for example, patterns of urban circulation in the Port Authority Bus Terminal project; valencies of the landscape in the Long Island House; spiritual forces in the Korean Presbyterian Church; appetitions of attention and lurings of movement in Predator). It is in view of this encounter that Lynn defines his project in terms of adventitious alliance rather than in terms of filiation, with its reverance for origins.xci
