Whatever we call these “thought-signs,” Lozano-Hemmer’s work cues them into action-perception. His work operationalizes the material quality of words. It works to activate language in enactive relation with nonlinguistic registers of experience. First and foremost, comes the kinesthetic: stirring. Agitating: already tending toward a next step, and a touch it may potentiate. Through touch, proceeding stepwise toward a renewal through movement of the field of vision. Operationalizing the material quality of words not only activates language in enactive relation to nonlinguistic registers – it anticipatorily activates those modalities’ relation to each other, in a stirring no-distinction between “raw” experience and enculturated experience.  This bare-active “no distinction” is not the opposite of a determination. Remember: it is the tendency that determines. What is at issue is determination’s pluripotent dawning across registers. Astretch a façade.
