The relation of the aesthetic effect to the interpretable content of the interaction appearing in words on the wall is the same as the relation of the event as a whole to the apparatus of its interface : neither separable from it, nor reducible to it. Meaningful content, reemergently modulated into a cultural domain and coming out in its expressive acts, is what is commonly called an ideological effect. Ideological effects may well arise as part of the cultural acts of expression enabled by relational architecture. But ideology is not where its politics “essentially lives.” Relational architecture has no inner ideological territory. It roves the boundaries, feeling the impetus for its acts in the forerunning of the abstract surface they compose. It eventfully stretches far afield.
