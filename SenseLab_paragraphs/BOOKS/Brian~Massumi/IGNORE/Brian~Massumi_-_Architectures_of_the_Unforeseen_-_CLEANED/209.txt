Proceeding in a family way brings with a number of benefits for topological architecture. For one thing, it telescopes the concern with intricacy into the fundamental running of the process. "Details and components can be defined both individually and collectively at the same instance,"xcvii such that there is "return of the whole and intensively defined part."xcviii Here, the fusional flicker between part and whole that defined the experiential intensity of the Predator surface is fully integrated the form-generating technique itself all along the line, rather than setting in at the end across the traces of the tooling. The unfolding of technique is less stratified here than in Predator, the cuts between its phases less sharp. Formation and perception, process and product, smooth together more, falling more into continuity with one another. In that sense, the expression of the process is more intense. Recursive filiation furthers intensive continuity.
