V.N. Vološinov echoes this in his formula that “expression organises experience.”xxxviii The organising center of any communication, he says, is not within the individual but in the open field of a collective outside.xxxix This is not the kind of outside that stands opposite to or as the negative of the inner life attributed to the individual through which it expressively crests. It is the outside constituted by the whole of communication, its sea. In Vološinov, this whole of communication is defined, in language reminiscent of Bakhtin's definition of the cultural domain, not as bounded but as a boundary regionxl: a region of contact, a crossing pointxli between the linguistic structure of the message carried by the signal and the extralinguistic noise of gesture, body, animality, our perceptions and memories, our habits of attention and learned responses, our tropisms and acquired tendencies, our skills, hopes, and desires. The "whole" of communication is the ensemble of modulations of individual expression, in a churning zone of indistinction extending by degrees to the far reaches of the universal history of sound.
