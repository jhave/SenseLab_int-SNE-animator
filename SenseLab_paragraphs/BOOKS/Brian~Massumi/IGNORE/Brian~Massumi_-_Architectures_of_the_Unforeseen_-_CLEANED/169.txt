All of this changes the terms of architectural design. The dialectic between volume and surface becomes secondary, displaced by the formative play of differential factors in open fields. The divide between the interior and exterior is no longer as fundamental, displaced by transductive relations between open fields. The fundamental concepts of architecture are no longer architectonic by nature. They are naturally processual instead.
