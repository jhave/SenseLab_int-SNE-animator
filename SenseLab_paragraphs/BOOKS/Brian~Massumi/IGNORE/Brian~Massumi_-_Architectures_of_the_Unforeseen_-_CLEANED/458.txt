If it is, then the question "what am I doing here" cannot be construed as asking if I am where I belong by right of origin or reason of identity. As asked by the artist, it is the open question of how, wherever I happen to chance, I am dappled by my elsewheres as I go, and how I might dapple them back in my passing. To answer questions like that, you don't look inward and you don't look back. You just venture out again, and continue on your way. In search of little nothings. That way, you encounter "smll epiphanies." That is what the artist calls being taken by surprise by an unsuspected connection. A little joy of happenstance.
