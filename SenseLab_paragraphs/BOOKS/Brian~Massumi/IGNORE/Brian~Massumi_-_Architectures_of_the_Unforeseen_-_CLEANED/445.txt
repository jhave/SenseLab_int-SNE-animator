Oddly, Australia itself seemed to echo this tension. "When I first lived here I used to imagine a vapour rising above the city, a confounded, teeth-gnashing, collective sigh of what am I doing here? and I added my angst to that imaginary cloud … In fact what I thought was my personal mantra – what am I doing here? – was something of a national chorus. I would say that this lament has a long lineage, probably going back to the time of white arrival and settlement."ii A cloud of agitation rising up from the city: in the eye of a storm, of impossible belonging. As the mine is to the open land, I am to the city (and the city to this nation).
