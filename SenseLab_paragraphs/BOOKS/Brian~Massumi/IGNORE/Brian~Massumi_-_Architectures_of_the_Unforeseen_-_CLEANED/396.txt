The eddy has declared its independence from the stream. Speech is individualized. This is the invention of the "sovereign" bourgeois individual. Theme in Volo≈°inov's sense, with its immanently formative connection to extraverbal levels, has been abstractly segregated on the side of the isolable individual, in a way that effectively confines it to the personality. A stable partitioning has been instituted between the "private" sphere, dedicated to the subjective manifestation of the "inner personality," and a "public" sphere of intersubjective communication where statements are answerable to norms of expression and subject to public judgment as to their "correctness" and "objectivity." This carries out another abstract segregation: of judgeable semantic content from theme. Theme may continue, personalized, inwardly impelled, eddying on in a barely discernible gurgle "behind" the intersubjective exchange, but it is only the semantic meaning of language, properly mediated by the formal structure of its stable constructions, that counts publically.
