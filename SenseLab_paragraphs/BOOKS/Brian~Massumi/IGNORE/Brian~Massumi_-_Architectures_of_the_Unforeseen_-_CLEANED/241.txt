The most cursory phenomenological investigation reveals that a body is not where it is but how it moves. A still body is not one. Albert Michotte: “When the body is motionless ... it simply disappears from the phenomenal world. ... Movement appears to be essential to the phenomenal existence of the body.”iv The body is one only with its movements – which are on a continuum with its sensations and perceptions. The body is what it performs.
