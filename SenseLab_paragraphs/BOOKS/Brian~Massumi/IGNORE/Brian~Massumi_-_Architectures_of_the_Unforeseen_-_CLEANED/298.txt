Given the infraphenomenal, nonsensuous nature of the what bestirs bare activity, the domain of culture must be seen as an abstract surface populated by virtual events.xxxii Each potential relay is just that, a virtual event. If the abstract surface of virtual events is a domain of culture, then a domain of culture is more time-like than it is spatial.
