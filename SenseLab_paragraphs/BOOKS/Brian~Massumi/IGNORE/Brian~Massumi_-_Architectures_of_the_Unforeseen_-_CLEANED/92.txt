The shape should not mislead. The particle does not fundamentally figure as a form. It is programmed for activity: as a counter-force to the field. Its shape is a token of its force, the rigidity it needs to resist the field’s dissolve, to resist being dissolved into the field. Its visible form is an expression of the invisible force of resistance it opposes to the continuum. The particle is endowed with a second force in addition to its rigidity factor: “mass.” The strength of the attractive and repulsive influences the basins exert on the particle, and the way in which it will be affected in the transitional zones where they shade in and out of each other, are functions of its assigned mass. Ratchet up the mass, and the way it moves will change. The velocity and path of the particle, the nature and extent of its movement, expresses the interaction of the gradient force-field with the sub-force-field of its mass. The movement is a visible expression of the relation between the resident forces of the field and those of the particle: its optical effect. Motto: FORM FOLLOWS FORCE.
