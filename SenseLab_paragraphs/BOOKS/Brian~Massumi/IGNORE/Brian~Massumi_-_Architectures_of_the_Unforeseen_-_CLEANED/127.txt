That's the point: metaphors happen; they are derived. They are by-products of the exuberance of the topological form-generating of the process, taken up at the point where that process stops. They mark one of its limits. They are a cut-off point of topological figure-formation. The key concept, worth repeating again, is that Lynnian resemblances are produced. They are produced by a process which in no way resembles its product – but may operatively echo it. The resemblances are "not attributable to some reduced simplified type but [i]s rather the result of dynamic non-linear interactions of internal directives … and the generative fields that are configured by a flexible and adaptable system of integrating differences."xxxix What biomorphism may be seen is the result of an operative analogy between how nature generates form in the wild and the nature of the form-generating process in the studio.
