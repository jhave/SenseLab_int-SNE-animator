As Simondon indicates, it is more precise to think of this topologically – in terms of stretching-folding for variation – than chronologically.x Think amoeba, stretching-folding, in ongoing variation. Think pseudopods formatively stretching forth then folding back to dissolve again toward the formation of a next step, the dynamic contours of a life’s activity morphing from moment to moment, from step to changing step, recapacitating, reorganizing, reconnecting. Re:Positioning. Think telescopings between scales, surfaces, and registers of activity. Think the body shadow-stretching onto the surface of a building, really-not-merely feeling its potential kinesthetically fill with words and mate with their extending potential. Think Graz and plague. Think now, then, and again. Think memories of the past and alien memories of the future, immediately present to each other.
