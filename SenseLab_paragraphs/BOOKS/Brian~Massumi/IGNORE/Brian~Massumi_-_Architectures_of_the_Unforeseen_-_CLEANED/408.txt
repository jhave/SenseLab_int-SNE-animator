What is so threatening about gossip to defenders of privacy and regulatory watchdogs of public speech is that it is neither: neither private exactly, nor public. Its crossing of the lines between individual and type, its blurring of the lines between "I" as this speaker and third-person other of an ilk, its collectivizing of the individual ear and socializing of evaluative accent, all of these things enable it to slip into the space between the two. Gossip inhabits the zone of indistinction between the private and the public. It has special status. It is quasi-public. Which is much the same as saying "quasi-private."
