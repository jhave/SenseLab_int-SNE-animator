Gilbert Simodon, the philosopher of relational individuation whose thinking is most thoroughly topological, speaks of the human body itself in terms of transduction.lvii Within the envelope of the body – or the "film" of the skin, as Bergson called it – lies a hierarchy of nested levels of innumerable proto-actors collectively composing the physical body. Each level constitutes a subsurface producing integral effects proper to its own level. These effects constitute expressive subgestures doubling the multiplicity of the proto-actors populating that level, or stratum. The sub-integral effects feed up the strata, peaking in affective expression-events,  issuing in the whole-body overgestures that we recognize as our actions. Hunger, for example, integrates a multitude of micro-events, physiological and psychic, and both in interfusion, in the global action of seeking or denying oneself food. Perception is the dynamic form doubling the body's actions as a whole.lviii It is the abstract surface of inscription for whole-body affect and action, in their expressive connection to each other, summing up in a single issue the teeming undergestures that percolate through the body's consituent levels.
