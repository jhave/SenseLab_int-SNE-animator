Part of the significance of Lynn's stadium-wave example is that it opens the possibility of understanding self-organizing body-events which occur on the abstract surface of perception as fundamentally architectural, even if they are ephemeral and purely abstract, doubled by no concrete surface, even if they are hosted by an architectural construction. Architectural constructs can host architectural body-events of the embryonic kind (the as-yet unconcretely doubled kind). Thes embryonic architectral body-events can be spontaneously self-organizing. Although stadium-waves have settled into the stuff of clich√©, they most likely originated spontaneously before becoming conventionalized.
