A partial answer to these questions was provided earlier, when it was said that even the built form in a sense stands incomplete. Tinged by the contingency of its making, lacking a self-aggrandizing sense of its own monumentality, it invites redesign or razing, remaining receptive to further processual in-foldings. But this modesty, this openness is addressed only to the small band of people with actual authority to influence decisions: basically, design, planning, and construction professionals, and the client. What of the crowds of people into whose lives the building enters, those who pass into it or simply pass it by? Can these questions be asked on their behalf? To do so is to ask that problems normally approached in terms of programmed function, with aesthetic or signifying extras, be reapproached processually: that the question of good form make a turn to becoming.
