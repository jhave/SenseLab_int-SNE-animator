The idea that "Amodal Suspension" makes perceptible the force of language can be articulated with this concept of noise.  Central to that concept is the fact that a sound never entirely disappears. It dissipates. It relaxes, spreads out, becoming less and less contracted, but it remains, hanging in the air, a breath away from silence, fused with the relaxation of every other sound that ever rang out. This noise of near-silence is an imperceptible background buzz, a vibratory limit of sound at which a sound rejoins all sound, in an open field. Evens calls it a “cosmic echo”: a universal history of sound (the ground of the ground, infinitely more encompassing than the proximate ground against which a sound figure stands in tectonic relief).
