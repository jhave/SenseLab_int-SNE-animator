As we have seen, the primary design elements are virtual forces. The virtual forces co-compose as differential fields. Architecturally embryonic topological figures arise from the differential fields' playing out. Across their iterations, these proto-architectural figures run into emergent architectural forms. The programming of the fields and their algorithmic runnings in-forms these emergences with performance envelopes that pre-engineer them, function-ready, for transductive relay into the urban field. Taken together, these formative factors constitute the generative matrix of digital topological architecture. None of the formative factors in themselves – virtual forces, differential fields, topological figures, proto-architectural figures, or performance envelopes – have the property of scale. Nor are they fundamentally answerable to formal types, conventional styles, or predefined functions. They are proto- all that. In themselves, are proto-polyvalent.lxvii Form and function emerge through them, and are only then captured by genre typology and style. In themselves, they are pluripotent: they carrying variations amany, enveloped in potential unfoldings. They are the form in which diversity of form operatively inheres.
