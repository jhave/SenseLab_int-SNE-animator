It is actually quite simple. The preceding discussion of how the topological figure differs from a classical Euclidean figure was all about deformation. Yet in that discussion there were no deforming forces (other than the force of thought). To instrumentalize topology in mutually inclusive fashion, you simply program deforming forces, with an abstractness and elusiveness equal to the ‘space’ of the figure. In other words, you use the computer to actualize the “absolute dynamic void” that was described earlier as the space or movement of topology. Of course, since that ‘space’ was virtual, absolutely recessive, when you bring it up on screen and actualize it, it is something else. The abstract space of the screen is a virtual double. You have added an analogue of the virtual to the actual. It is very important to be clear about where the virtual isn’t. The virtual isn’t on the screen. It isn’t in the pixels. It isn’t in the code. It isn’t in the machine language. All of these are actual. They are technological “stations.” The virtual is what runs through them. The virtual is what passes when the program boots. It is what happens when all these elements operatively fuse into a running event.
