It was at a certain point in history, Vološinov argues, that specific mechanisms were invented to abstractly segregate cultural acts from their impletion.lvi The point in history was the nineteenth century, and the result was the invention of the "sovereign" bourgeois individual. A partition was instituted between the "private" sphere, dedicated to the subjective manifestation of the "inner personality," and the "public" sphere of intersubjective communication subject to rules of propriety and objectivity. The public sphere is the collective correlate to the segregation of expression in the individual person. It comes to be synonymous with the social, appearing in the externalized figure of "society" over and against the individual. In well-regulated social interaction, the cultural differences a person may carry as a trace of their belonging to a field of life larger than themselves, in unplaceable continuity with the alien, and extending the threshold of expression beyond the vicinity of known potential, must be checked at the door of the public sphere – lest personal sensitivities be insulted. The same mechanisms that individualize expression segregate "culture" from "society."
