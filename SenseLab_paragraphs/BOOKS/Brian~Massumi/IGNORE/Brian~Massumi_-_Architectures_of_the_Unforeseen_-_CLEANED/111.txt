In the Long Island House project, the virtual strings attached to the intersection points of the splinar H-frame connected to “site forces”: attractions or repulsions in the gradient field modeling the plot on which the house would be built. Again in response to client preference, the site forces primarily concerned visibility. A large tree and the line of sight to the ocean were programmed as forces of attraction. A neighboring house blocking the view of the ocean and an existing driveway were forces of repulsion. The connection of the skeleton frame to these forces actively translated features of the site into form. To be more precise, they translated values attached to site features into iterations of proto-architectural form-generation. The values entering the process, it must be emphasized, were not the architect’s. The architect’s contribution came in the way a formal typology and hierarchy of values imposed by another’s desires were integrated into the developing design process. Love those blobs: they seem to have attached themselves to certain edges of the frame. While the frame is busy formally propagating translated site influences, the blobs are at it again, doing their thing. But their range of amoebic mutation was now limited by their value-laden splinal mooring. Their neighborly abandon is moderated in a way that successfully renders it proto-functional: the tubularities that the blobs become in congress will be architecturally rendered as transitional spaces between the inside of the relationally activated frame and the influential outside of site-specific values. The project, however, is never built. It remains a proto-house, its growth stopped short of actual architectural rendering.
