In the continuing process, as in its punctual sejour in an art site, it is necessary to make to place. That's an odd way that the artist has of putting it, but it makes immediate sense if you think of making to place on the model of singing to tune. Singing to tune involves following a piece of music, attentive to its composition, just as making to place involves passing through, following the lay of the land, attentive to its features. When you sing to a tune, you don't have to slavishly follow it. You can vary it, adding your own embellishments. The same is true of making to place. You can vary place with your passing. The analogy starts to break down when the place is an art place where a number of makings to place are slated to come together. It's a bit like singing to more than one tune at the same time. How do keep it from degenerating into a cacophony? Where do you find the middle ground between site-nonspecific cacophony and being on "about"?
