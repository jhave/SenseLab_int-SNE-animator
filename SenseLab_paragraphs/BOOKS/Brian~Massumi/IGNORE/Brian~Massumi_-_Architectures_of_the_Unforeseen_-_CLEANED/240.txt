This is not a metaphor. It is only the commonsense idea that the body is an object, with the accompanying, reductive belief that an object is single and “site-specific” (only what and where it is) rather than serial and relationship-specific (all the interconnections it can go into) that prevents us from taking telembodyment literally.
