Since the lines that compose the cultural domain are not outlines separating off an interior space, there is no definite line of demarcation between companion others and aliens. Everything is on a continuum. The almost-presence of companionable others virtually co-populating the neighborhood shades into the potential intrusion of the alien. Other/alien: the nondividing line is fine. If you go from neighbor to neighbor, at what point do your neighbors fade off into strangers? The alien is at the threshold. Maybe not yours, maybe not next door's, but who knows for the next after that?
