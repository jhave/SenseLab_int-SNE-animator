Given its scope, the field of culturability from which the cultural act emerges cannot be equated with culture in the normal sense, as opposed to nature. The possibility of that opposition sets in on the level of cultural domain comprising the proximate neighborhood of the cultural. It is a feature of the content coded into that domain. Culturability, for its part, cannot be opposed to nature, for the simple reason that the process running through it is the enculturation of nature: the furthest cosmic stretch of elemental potential expressively folding into the tightness of the particular cultural act, in-forming its taking-determinate-form of the essential unboundedness of its open grounding, ground of ground.
