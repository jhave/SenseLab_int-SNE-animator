Each exemplification of the cultural domain is a cultural act: culture in the act. The cultural act selectively expresses the cultural domain in the shape of a determinate move. The cultural domain, as virtual group or potential peopling, is singularly multiple. The act exemplifying it for the moment can be more or less singled out. It is determinate, a clearly (if not wholly) perceptible instantiation of the cultural domain's continuing variety. It can be more or less singled out in its cultural particularity because of the way its taking place is inhabited by the virtual group. The individual cultural act is a singleton, pregnant with peopling.
