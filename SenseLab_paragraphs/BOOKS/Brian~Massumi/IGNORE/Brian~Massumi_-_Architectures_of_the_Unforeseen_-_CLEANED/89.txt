There is a common critique of Lynn’s work that it is “naïvely” complicit with “naturalism.” This objection must be tempered. The opposition between the natural and the artificial, as commonly understood, is not in any way fundamental here. Neither is the dichotomy between the naïve and the contrived. They may well be fundamental to other operations, particularly ones that style themselves “critical.” But here, the artificial is affirmed as being as natural as nature by any other definition. There is considered to be a generic (processual) indistinction between nature and culture. Taking in the givenness of indistinct nature(-culture), and forcefully bringing it to another surpassing of itself, requires the most artificial of means. The given only figures in the process as prepared for this surpassing. Naturalism (the genre) and naïveté are not the issue. The issues are virtual process and its procedural expression across an operative nature-culture continuum, with respect to which divisions between the two are derivative stations. Like all static forms, seen or conceived, their separateness is on the level of effect. It is produced (and endures only as forcefully re-produced). Our static metaphysical sense of the natural and the artificial as discrete formations needs to bend to a pragmatics of virtual processing and its generic vagueness – understood as reproductive of distinction (productive of new difference). If this generative, iterative perspective also bends our sense of the -isms we have grown anxiously accustomed to opposing, so be it. Relax, let down your genres. Leave your battle stations. Follow process.
