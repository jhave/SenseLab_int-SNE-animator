Once again, you begin with forces. You begin by thinking of the building and its eventual site in terms of the forces operative in and around them. Remember, you cannot see a force. Only the effects of forces are visible. Forces are actually accessible only in traces of the deformations they effect. Forces are invisible realities. It is like them to recur. So they are not all in any particular exercise of their effective power. They are singularly recessive; iterative and therefore also generic; variational, thus multiple. In a word, forces are virtual. They are the natural expression of the virtual. So you simulate them. You double the natural expression of the virtual by the most artificial of means.
