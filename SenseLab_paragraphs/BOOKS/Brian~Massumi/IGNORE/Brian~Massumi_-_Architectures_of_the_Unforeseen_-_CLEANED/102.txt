At the same time, a pattern emerges. This is because the law of large numbers takes over. Statistically, many more particles will make their way to the strongest basin than will fly off unpredictably. The precise path each particle will take toward its probable entropic destiny will vary, so that although the overall pattern may be foreseen, its exact contours cannot be. The form can only be vaguely predicted, and remains fuzzy on the edges. When order arises out of resonance, even the most exact determination of process parameters renders “anexact” form.xxi It is the element of unpredictability and the persistence of processual vagueness that allows Lynn to speak of the formal end-effect as “animate,” even if it has run out into a largely stable pattern.
