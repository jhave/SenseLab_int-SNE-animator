This brings up an important point: architectural body-events, even ephemeral, are subject to capture.lx This is the processual definition of program. An architectural program is a blueprint for the capture of a species of architectural body-events. Architectural genres are preplanned forms of capture. The processual point is that even when architectural body-events are captured, for example when stadium-waves come to be preplanned, consciously led and organized by pre-designated instigators, they still must take. However planned they may be, their proximate origin is the always the affective uptake of the fans' collectively fanning the fandom fires. They don't always take. And even once started, they may fizzle. If they take, their unfolding always has an element of contingency. They may travel to the opposite side of the stadium before winking out, for example. But the again, they might circle all the way around. They might bifurcate into two waves, and the two may cross paths. When this happens, they may move through each other each to continue on its way, or run interference with each other and fall into chaos. However clich√©d it has become, the dynamic form of the stadium-wave continues to exhibit self-organizing dynamic-form-generating potential. In their ability to "choose" to take or not, to continue along different paths, to converge and diverge, to resonate or interfere with each other, stadium waves display topological vitality that is not unblob-like even though its visible manifestation and the field of its emergence are entirely different. The same is true for an architectural construction realizing a program in a given genre of building.
