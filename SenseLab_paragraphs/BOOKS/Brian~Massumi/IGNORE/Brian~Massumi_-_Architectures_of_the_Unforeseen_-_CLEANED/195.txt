The extra-effect of affective atmosphere related to the use of color carries out its own function, of a sort. It operates as an attractor – not unlike the basins of attraction wooing the on-screen particle clouds of other projects. This is where the perceiving body, the individual body of inhabitation, reenters – in multiples. After all, this is an art installation, offered to the public's for its passing inhabitation. Crowds cloud around. The perfusing of the surrounding space by the "decorative" affective effect creates a pull towards the figure as a whole. Pulled in toward the figure, the attention of the perceiving body flickers to the level of detail, bringing out the intricacy of the composing elements' interdependency – but momentarily losing the overall effect. The attention then flickers back to the figure as a whole, only to be lured by the next pull of the intricacy of the compositional activity of the details insisting on itself. This is also a flicker between the figure's concrete emplacement as the seat of detail, and the holistic diffusion-effect of the figure's affective filling of the surrounding space. The effect is a certain animatedness, in which the body of the visitor shares. The body is led, pulled on a flickering leash, into an ongoing oscillatory exploration of the figure. The body moves, around the figure and into its invaginations. In the course of this exploratory ambulation, the figure incrementally unfolds its integral expression in an improvised variation. This will occur differently for each individual body, creating something like a probability distribution, in part determined by the predilections and attentional habits of the attendant bodies. The figure's perceptual peaking will be composed and recomposed by the milling of the bodies. Through the crowd, the singularity of the figure forms its own multiplicity, any number of versionings of itself intricated in its public cohabitation.
