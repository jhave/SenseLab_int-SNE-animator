The two limits co-operate. They coincide, crosswise, co-generative of culturing. They are inverse and simultaneous. Every cultural act of communication, however intersubjectively functionalized, returns to some degree to the immanent limit, if only by default (by the impossibility of entirely filtering out amoebism and thirdness). The cultural act is strung between a cosmic limit of repotentializing run and return, and the achieved human limit of its determinately taking place; between cosmic deterritorialization, and making a recognizable mark on the human map; between relational emergence, and owned interactive exchange; between a relational nature-culture continuum of indeterminate self-refreshing expanse, and coordinate intersubjective positioning; between the regenerative whole of its potential variation and the perishing particularity of its having been said and done, to functional effect. Such is its scope. Such is its field.
