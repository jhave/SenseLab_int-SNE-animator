Not yet. So far, we have little more than a speck wafting around on the screen. That hardly qualifies as startlingly new, let alone a bus terminal. The whole thing also seems so programmed and mechanical. The force of gravity it accepts into the very heart of its modeling seems to be the epitome of determinism. How could such a recalcitrantly Newtonian force "surpass the given"? It is hard to see why Lynn persists in calling the process “animate.”
