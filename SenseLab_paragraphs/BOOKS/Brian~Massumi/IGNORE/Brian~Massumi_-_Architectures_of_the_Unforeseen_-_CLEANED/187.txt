All of the varieties of design object encompassed by Lynn's practice inhere in this singularly muliple matrix. Lynn does not skip around eclectically. He systematically returns to this generative field. By tweaking procedures, modulating enabling contraints, and adjoining new channels of continuing – most notably automated milling using computerized numerical control (CNC) – the process is iteratively reoriented toward outcomes answering to the exigencies of specific genres and their requirements in terms of program, or functionalized performance. It is because diversity inheres in the matrixial field that Lynn's design practice coheres in its diversification. In fact, his practice exhibits more consistency, processually speaking, than is typically the case. The focus on surfaces increasingly assumes the responsibility for orienting the playing-out of the cohering diversities' matrixial consistency.
