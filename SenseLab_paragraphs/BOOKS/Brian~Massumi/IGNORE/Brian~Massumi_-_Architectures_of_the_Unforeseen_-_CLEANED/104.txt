One of the upshots is: the universal architectural constraint of gravity has been internalized as an enabling condition of the design. Instead of feeling his creativity constricted or contradicted by it, the architect welcomes gravity into the design process and plays variations on its resonance-readiness. The constraint of gravity becomes a positive contributor in the creation of new form. Any number of gravity-resistant forms can be generated simply by varying the parameters and doing a re-play. Which end-form will be chosen? It is in the selection – out the far end of the process – that issues of style and reading may enter back in. The selection may well be made by the architect, in cognizance of the genres of architecture and their history, as a function of her allegiances and aversions, or her will to distinguish her work. Although, it is just as likely that the client’s taste and (perhaps) ignorance of and inability to read architectural history will intervene. In that case, the architect can still inflect the outcome by taking the client’s reaction and stated preferences and re-generating the form until a mutually acceptable mutation of designer and client preferences emerges – something recognizable enough from both sides that it “passes,” but not so recognizable as to be confined simply to being one way or another. The design process can internalize another universal architectural constraint almost as easily as that of gravity: that of social negotiation. In fact, the closer the design process comes to alluviating into concrete, built form, the  more negotiated it will become. For example, contractors may feel that pre-engineering leaves something to be desired. No problem: tweak and re-run again. The process continues.
