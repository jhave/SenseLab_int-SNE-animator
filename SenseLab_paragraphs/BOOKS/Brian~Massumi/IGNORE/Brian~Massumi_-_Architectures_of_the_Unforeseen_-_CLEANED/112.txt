In Lynn’s approach, what the architect works with during the design process is not an architectural object – yet. It is a proto-formal, proto-functional, abstractly real evolutionary entity. It is proto-architectural until it is actually built. Animate architecture posits a difference in kind between proto-type and finished architectural form. The proto-type is its own abstract reality becoming-architectural. The prefix “proto-” is misleading. The proto-type isn’t an already-architectural object of a certain type waiting passively on screen to be realized in steel. It is already actively real and still in process: it has the virtual reality of what was earlier characterized as a hypertype. Here, “hyper-” can substitute for “proto-.” Looking at Lynn’s design projects, it is difficult to make sense of them as determinate kinds of building, house, or terminal. They still have to be rendered recognizably architectural. This happens gradually as (if) they pass into construction. They are architecturally type-cast in passing: in continuation of a process that changes its nature as it goes. The evolving, hyper-typological, proto-reality of the design entity is what makes it necessary to speak of the design process encountering its own discipline as its outside, as it does with other contributory factors. The design process encounters its discipline as an external cultural constraint or natural given that it variationally internalizes – as part of the same passage by which it comes to be internalized by the discipline, as part of its own continuing variation (double becoming).
