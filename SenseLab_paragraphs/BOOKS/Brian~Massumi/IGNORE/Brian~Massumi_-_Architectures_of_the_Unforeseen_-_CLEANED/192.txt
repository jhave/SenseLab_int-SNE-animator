Traces of the manufacturing technique – the tool paths left by the milling – remained engrained in surface. These reactivated at the level of the perceptual figure's taking off into itself as additional factors of its formation. "The geometry of these tool paths is intricately related to the shape of the surface so that undulations in the pattern highlight and reflect the undulations in the form itself. In this manner an intensive decorative pattern emerges from the shape itself."lxxviii There is indeed a certain decorative dimension to the perceptual effect – a novelty in Lynns work that came into effect with the Predator project and remained an ongoing interest from that point onwards.lxxix But this decorative dimension is "intensive": it inheres in the cohering of the elements. It cannot be separated from the effect of their interdependency. It does not stand as a discrete element that has been applied. It co-inheres, integrally in-folded, adding not a discrete feature but rather a holistic "highlighting." What it highlights is the effective relationality enveloped in the figure's fusional multiplicity. The decorative perceptual effect here is not working for itself. It is doubling genesis, making the intricacy of its many-fusioned emergence felt.
