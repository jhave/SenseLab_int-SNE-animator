The communicational system found in nature best able to do that is human language. Human communication is defined by this linguistic “thirdness,” by its capacity not for linear transmission but for indirection. This complicates things: with the third party in waiting down the line comes the possibility of that party jumping the line and intercepting the message. Indirect relay and message poaching, or hacking, is of the very nature of human communication. With indirect relay comes the inevitably of noise and the accompanying distortion of message content. A fuller model than sender and receiver, with a coded message passing between them, would be a combination of the games of “telephone” and musical chairs.
