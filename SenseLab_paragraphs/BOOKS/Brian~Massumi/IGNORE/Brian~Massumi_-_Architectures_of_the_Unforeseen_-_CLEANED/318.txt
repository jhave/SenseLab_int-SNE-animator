“Vectorial Elevation: Relational Architecture No. 4” homed in on the  expressive operation of relational architecture. Participants were offered the opportunity to design a light pattern on their home computers, and then remotely activate a searchlight array that actualized the pattern in the night sky above the Zócalo, Mexico City’s main square. Every six seconds the pattern changed. When it did, the searchlight beams would move in unison, criss-crossing in a choreography of light, until they abruptly set into a next position. A kinesthetic ballet in vision.
