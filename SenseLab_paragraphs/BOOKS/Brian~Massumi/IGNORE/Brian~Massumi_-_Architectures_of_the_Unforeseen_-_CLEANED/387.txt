What "Amodal Suspension" suspends is the semantic finality of the "as pertains to content." The understanding of the semantic content of the messages is refracted and interfered with. The cresting of the evaluative accent is deferred, if not lost in the ebb and flow. Priming is largely disabled. The speech act's particularity, its taking on of determinate content, is suspended.
