The quality of process in question has been amply characterized already. The process is serial. The seriation is of events. The process redefines itself at each event-step. It is evolutionary. Each event along the way is a more-or-less chance encounter, between its own internal variables, or between its internal variables and external constraint. The design process evolves most decidedly by integrating external constraints, converting them into internal growth factors: folding them into its self-generative activity. The process is additive. It is capable not only of multiplying versions of its formal results ad infinitum, but also of indefinitely increasing and varying the internal variables it eventfully combines toward each result. Welcoming of intrusion from outside, it is “pliant.” Which is not the same as “compliant” in the normal sense.xxxii It doesn’t conform to external contraints. It folds them in – to its own unfolding. It uses them to vary its results, to creatively diverge. The integrative process of divergent variation is autonomous in spite of – because of – its responsiveness to the encountered necessities of the outside. Both in terms of its internal disposition and its outward responsiveness, the process more fundamentally involves a composition of relations than of forms or elements of form. The composing of relations runs: it takes time. The process is durational: open-ended. Static form is its productive fall-out.
