It is the nature of the alien to be always at the threshold, potentially. The cultural act can never purify itself of the alien memories discussed earlier. They are in the paradoxical condition of being in processual proximity at whatever distance, lurking in the folds of the event. Spied from the familiar vicinity of the cultural domain, they are the once and future feared. They are the already-feared unfamiliars, and as-yet unknown future intruders. They are faceless. They extend, plague-like, above and beyond the scale of the human. At the limit of their alienness lies not only the unknown, but the as-yet unknowable: unknown unknowns. Are these necessarily to be feared? Really? Do we have to give Donald Rumsfeld the last word on potential? Doesn't work like Lozano-Hemmer's, in making potential palpable, and by deploying it in an open field of ultimately indeterminate expanse, invite a hospitality toward the unknown of potential, beyond the fold of the cultural domain? Does it not evoke the potential for a culturing beyond cultural community? Can not put the alien on the spectrum, rather than fear it as a specter?
