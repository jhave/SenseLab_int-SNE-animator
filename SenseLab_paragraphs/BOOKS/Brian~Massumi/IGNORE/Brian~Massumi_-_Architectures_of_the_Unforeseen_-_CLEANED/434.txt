What else? An extracting. Here, iron is extracted. From here, iron is exported to build other places. The steel-girded cities of China rise from here. Also from here rare earth metals go into handheld devices, magnetizing the everywhere and nowhere-in-particular of the communication web that instantly links the cities of China to their counterparts in Australia and across the globe. Gold goes too, to give psychological ballast to the global financial markets whose own over-networked weightlessness cyclically whirligigs into free fall. From the point of view of the everywhere and nowhere-in-particular of what goes from here, the hole below of the plane's eye view is the eye of a rising storm of global activity. This is not just a metaphor. Not far from here coal is also massively extracted, fueling unbridled industry and climate change. The bright economic outlook of the outback mine is a distant twinkle in the Sandy eye of our "once in a century storms," which of late come every five years.
