But the art of no reason is nevertheless curative, in a way. For minor joys are oddly not incompatible with major horrors. Horrors like mines making a tabula rasa of someone else's history and meanings. You are fully aware of the horror, you understand its grounding, you have studied its history, you don't deny or neglect or paper over any of that. You don't empty other people's place, or take their place and speak your concepts and analysis on their behalf. You hold your tongue and empty your own relation to place: in order to retrace it, attentive to emergent connections. The horrors and injustices of a place are part of what creates the conditions for that encounter. They are not in any way neglected. They are refracted. In a sense, the ground rises with the background. It is a contributing factor in the artistic retracing. It is re-presented, horror and all, in some manner of trace, along with the small epiphany that emerged in contrast to it. Without it, the small epiphany would have nothing with which to contrast its little joy. Art, practiced as a procedure of living, is an affect-conversion apparatus. It extracts a modicum of affirmative intensity from all that weighs a place down. It's a bit like a mining operation itself: a telluric extraction and refinement of what is found on the ground. Unlike the mine, it does not simply mirror its own emptiness. It does not hollow out the land. It refracts its complexity in an emergent minor key. It empties, to otherwise refill. It applies no balm. In its own little way, it intensifies.
