Another way of putting this is that it comes to the same to say that the concrete surface of the installation perceptually extends into the surrounding space to in-form an atmosphere of inhabitation, and that the body's movements come to indwell the abstract surface of the figure. The body is operating, in the figure's furthered formation, as a cursor refreshing its appearing. The body is figuring as a vector of the figure's actualization in a new variation. The figure's taking-off into its own integral appearance and the body's coming to it in perception are one. The body, its perception, its appetites, the movements they actuate, becomes intricated with the figure, operatively fused with it. In the final analysis, there is but one abstract surface, formed of the interfusion and transfusion occurring in the relational in-between described by the polar limits of the concrete surface of the construction and the film of the body. Perception is not in the body. It is not in a subject inhabiting the body. It is on the abstract surface, indwelling its reactualization. Perception is nothing more or less than a generative movement on an abstract surface that is one with its own appearing. Perception is a surface effect. lxxxiii  Even – perhaps even most intensively – when it extends itself into a surround.
