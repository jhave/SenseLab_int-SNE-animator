Both of these solutions to the continuing problem are predicated on an appeal to the perception, foregrounding the embodied nature of perception and striving to overcome the duality between the embodied subject of architecture and the materiality of the built environment. The work of Spuybroek and Arakawa and Gins demonstrate that it is possible to imbue form with greater dynamism and multiplicity, reintensifying the architectural end result with intensities of ongoing potential, without falling back on any constitutive role for metaphor, symbolism, or signification, and without predefined function taking form-generating precedence. But this will not be Lynn's way. After flirting with this path in the fins of the Korean Presbyterian Church, Lynn lets it drop like a deflated blob. It is as if he wishes to avoid, at all costs, anything that might steer architecture toward something resembling phenomenology.xlv Any appeal to perception, embodied or not, however integrally in-betweened, is, it would seem, to skirt too phenomenally close for comfort. This has contributed to a widespread judgment leveled againt Lynn's work, one that is without doubt the most commonly stated reason among his detractors for dismissing his work: that he is a "formalist." A corollary to this judgment is that he lacks a concept of the body, or even that he is coldly, digitally, methodically anti-body, a kind of fundamentalist of geometrical reason. This is a misdiagnosis.
