These essays are not "about." They are writings-with. Each arose from a fortuitous encounter tantamount to a capture: a latching to an alien creative practice of my own process of philosophical concept-making, at very particular points of contact. Points of contact is not the best way of putting it because it connotes two already made forms rubbing up against each other and sharing something of their contents across a boundary. What I am talking about is at a very different level, the level at which things are in the making: where what they can do and where they can go is a pressing, open question. This is the level of constitutive problems, using the word "problem" in the positive sense of a galvanizing tension imparting an impetus for a process to take shape. A constitutive problem energizes a coming trajectory with formative potential, but not without also lacing it with imperatives acting as enabling constraints that will orient its unfolding without predefining it. A region of problematic overlap is a better way of putting it than a point of contact. Two processes, strangers to each other, can intimately overlap in a problematic that is constitutive for both, without coming in any way to resemble each other in form, or even sharing content. Practices do not share content. They fashion their own, reciprocal to their singular taking-form. They may perturb each other or attune, interfere or resonate, cross-fertilize or contaminate, but each will ultimately incorporate the formative potential in their own problematic way, so that the overlap is also a forking. This is what Deleuze and Guattari call aparallel evolutioni: the intimate art of keeping a formative distance.
