Here come the “blobs.” The cloud-massing particles discussed so far were not topological figures. Their shape was invariant. What was topological in the sense discussed earlier was how their collective relation to the gradient field played out. Lynn’s trademark blobs directly figure topological transformations.xxvi A blob is a flexible sphere radiating a quasi-gravitational field of influence. The force of the field varies according to the blob’s surface area and assigned “mass.” When two or more blobs enter into proximity, their fields of influence interact, forming a zone of relation or reciprocal transformation. Depending on how their relation plays, they will either inflect each other’s surface amoebically in unpredictable ways, or fuse into a single super- blob. From the topological point of view, Lynn notes, a sphere is but a lonely blob: a blob without influence, isolated from neighboring forces.xxvii Once again, classical geometric figures can be considered isolates or extractive limit-cases of topological transformations.
