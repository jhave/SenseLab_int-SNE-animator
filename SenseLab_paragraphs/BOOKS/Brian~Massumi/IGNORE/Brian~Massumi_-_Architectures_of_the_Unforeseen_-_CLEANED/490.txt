"Housing": not the right word at all. It connotes a domestic space. The art place, arrived at from this direction, is not an analogue of the domestic place. What it is certainly not "about" is domesticating the horrible wild world out there. No balms allowed. Domestic place, as it is conventionally lived, is all about balming. It is just as necessary to peel the domestic away from itself as it is to lift the lid on site-specific consensual realities â€“ the accepted public sense of the "right" way to the live here. Don't take refuge from the public in the domestic. Float the difference. Refract them in each other. Lifebow between them.
