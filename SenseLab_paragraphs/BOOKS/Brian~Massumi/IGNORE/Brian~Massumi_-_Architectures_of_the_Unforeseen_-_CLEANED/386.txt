Priming was given earlier as an example of how semantic content is enacted at a more formative level than it is understood. In priming, the content of the word gets directly into the act at its bare-active incipiency. It is as active a factor in the individuation of the cultural act as any muscular effort that may also figure, even if its action is absent by nature to the present of understanding, acting as it does in the gap. In the gap-action of priming, the contrasts, level and scales distinguished by semantic content and its present cognitive present understanding are telescoped into action across their specific differences and grid-positionings. Old is in immediate proximity with young. Florida is as effectively here as there. This fusional wholeness or holding-together of disparate potential is always already tending toward a specific playing out. There is already an orientation on the way. In the example given earlier, slowness of step was the extraverbally performed evaluative accent of gap-acting "bingo." Vološinov's concept of theme asserts that this enactive on-the-oriented-way from indistinct potential whole to particular evaluative accent is the "meaning" of the speech act in its fullest sense – more than formally semantic; including the act's informal, even deforming, performative implication with the extraverbal. Theme is what effectively makes the speech act an act. It is the force of language as it comes more-than-meaningfully to pertain to content.
