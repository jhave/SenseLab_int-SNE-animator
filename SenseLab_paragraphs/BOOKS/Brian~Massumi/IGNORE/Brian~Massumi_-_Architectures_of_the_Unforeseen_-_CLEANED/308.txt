Culturability stretches from the region of clear expression that is the cultural act to the farthest reaches of the kinsethetic amoeba's multiplex potentiation. It stretches the plane of the cultural domain into a field – an open field, composed of intersectings of boundaries, while being itself unbounded. If the cultural domain is like the moving background against which the cultural act figures, the field of culturability is the ground of the ground: the ground's shading off in all directions into the unappearing. The cultural domain is what Whitehead would call the real potential of the act, in-forming its occurrence. The field of culturability is the shading off of its real potential into pure potential (Deleuze's virtual at its most really abstract). The real potential is the pattern of potentials that enter into close enough processual proximity to the act's occurrence as to palpably propose themselves for its expression, so that the act could be said to have infra-felt them – to have virtually "chosen" from among them to produce itself as their singular fusion, and thus in some sense to have known them, in the dynamic form of its own coming to pass. Pure potential is real potential shading off into the unknown: unknowable for this act, but perhaps not for the next, or another somewhere down the line. Pure potential is the reservoir of real potential, running out to the abstractest reaches of the real. It is the far-real. The aliennest memory of the real. The cultural domain in-forms the act with its real potential. The field of culturability out-runs it with maximally other potential, pure alien potential.
