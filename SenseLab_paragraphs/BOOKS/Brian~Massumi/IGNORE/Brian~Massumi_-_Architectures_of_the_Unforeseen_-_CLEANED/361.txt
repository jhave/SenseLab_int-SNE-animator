An archive of reportable speech is resting place of communication. But it still harbors an organizing force. Reaccessed, an expression inflects. It takes on an undertone and a new orientation. No utterance, as Derrida argued, is ever entirely original. A speech act is always a “citation” that regathers the force of the already-said, but with a difference, repeating it with a variation – modulating it (in analogue fashion).
