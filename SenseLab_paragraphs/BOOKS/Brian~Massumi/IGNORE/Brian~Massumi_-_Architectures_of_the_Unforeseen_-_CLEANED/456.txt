It could be anything, really. For when you are venturing out nosing for naught, with openness and attentiveness, something else is just as good. The expression of the passenger next to you on the train catches your eye. That's something. Where are they going? What ephemeral musing or mortal concern just flitted across their face? And: why for heaven's sake are they dressed like that? There's something else. You get off the train and a motled sunshine falls across a fa√ßade, dappling it, fleetingly, with patches of light and shadowed reminders of the building standing across the way. Strange, how what stands so stolidly in place takes account in itself for what stands away across from it. What more distant places might likewise, if less visibly, cross into this place? In what dappled connection at a distance does this place cross back to them? Could this criss-cross, this mutual refraction, this reciprocal taking into account, be what place is really all about, more than any proper standing or being here by right?
