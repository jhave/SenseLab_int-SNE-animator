The point about gossip is not that the gossipy content has increased. It was always high volume. It is that, with social media, the internet itself has brought to global expression and previously unheard-of prominence (at a level not even "they" would have suspected) the tendency of which gossip has been the most historically constant and reliable agent: the quasi-directification of social relation. The internet has taken quasi-direct relation to a global scale, and made it unmistakeably the dominant mode of expression. Under the impulsion of social media, the internet has ushered in the reign of the quasi-public. It has massively back-stepped the cultural act into the domain of sociability â€“ "pure sociality" as the "field of immanence" of expressive variation, "the intrinsic nature of association" in its reaching for language.lxxvii
