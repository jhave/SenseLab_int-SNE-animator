Lynn, of course, does not deny the existence of the phenomenal subject. The openness of his process to in-folding outside growth factors that include client preference and even belief is proof enough of that. But that is all the subject is to his process: one growth factor among many, all of which differentially populate the generative field of the design process. As we have seen, Lynn's own subjecthood, his own authorial agency, likewise figures as growth factor for the in-folding. Any constitutive or foundational appeal to a subject, embodied or not, understood in Cartesian terms as sovereign author of its actions or in phenomenological terms as a transcendental field, would vitiate the processual autonomy of the architectural process as self-running, for emergence. It would water down the animateness of animate form. It is precisely because Lynn is not a formalist that he needs a concept of animate form â€“ a concept of form that is processual through and through. "Animate" form has none of the characteristics of form in the usual sense: having a general or ideal existence lying outside process; being fully determined and categorizable according to inherent properties; appealing to the recognition and operating according to resemblance based on those properties; serving as a mold for a matter separate from the mold, such that formation is applied from without in an exercise of transcendent ordering reproducing the same, rather than arising immanently from within the playing-out of a generative field of difference producing yet more difference. It is for the same processual reasons that Lynn rejects the subject-path and that he is not a formalist.
