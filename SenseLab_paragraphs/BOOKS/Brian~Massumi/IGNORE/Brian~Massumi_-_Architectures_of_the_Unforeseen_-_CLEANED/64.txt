Characterizing the topological as I have, there is no choice but to say that if the figure is or is in a space, it is an absolute space of formal transformation: positionless; unclassifiable and therefore incomparable; only in its own ever-recessive process; pure immanence. It is perhaps best to call it an absolute movement instead of an absolute space, given its vanishingly durational nature.
