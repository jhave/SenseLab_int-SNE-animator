The human limit is an internal limit. An internal limit is one that can be reached. It is internal to a domain. When the movement reaches such a limit it passes a threshold, whereupon it expires. It is then taken back up, after what may be an imperceptible hiatus, and makes a movement of return. In other words, an internal limit is a threshold between exercises of the same kind of passage. For example, a message is sent and reaches its addressee. It has completed its communicational trajectory for all intersubjective intents and purposes. It has exhausted itself. Upon reception, all it is, is said and done. Said and done and owned. The sender has no choice but to own up to it, as the addressee takes it back up, to return a response, which she in turn must own. In crossing the threshold, the message's communicational movement has passed from first-person communicational call to  second-party communicational response. The sent message, received, perishes into its interactive follow-on effect on the two-party line of intersubjective communication. Internal limits are interactive in that they concern dual relations of action-reaction. They govern cyclic movements remaining internal to the same domain and exemplifying the same manner of event â€“ the kinds of events that are functionally intolerant of the amoebic mating of dimensions of experience and the nonlinear rhythms of third-party noise, and endeavor to filter it out to the extent possible in order to safeguard a regularized back-and-forth. Such is the cultural act at its most communicationally human.
