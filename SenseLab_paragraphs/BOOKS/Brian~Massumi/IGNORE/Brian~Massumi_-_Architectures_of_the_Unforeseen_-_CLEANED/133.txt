“On the hull’s surface, multiple points of sail are ... resolved in the form itself ... multiple vectors of movement are stored in the object itself as potential energy” (34). The constituted form itself is understood (and used) dynamically, from the point of view of potential for variation. The form’s variational responses to contingencies of force are carry-overs from the active space of the topological design process. They are abstract design dynamics that have entered into the object and are “stored” in it. What is potential energy if not a remainder of virtual movement in actual station? A surcharge of multiplicity imbuing the simplicity of an unchanging form? A surplus of variation animating a single spline? Something of the process has been effectively packed into the product, making it concretely multiple-singular. It doesn’t matter so much what the hull looks like as long as it meets generic expectations, in both its multiplicity and its singularlity. No matter what it looks like, there will be visual and linguistic associations. Granted. But they will have nothing to do with the operative identity of the design process, as it has successfully carried over into its product. The carry-over of potential energy is an invisible thread of connection bringing the constituted form back into continuity with its formation. The product still doesn’t resemble the formative process. But then it doesn’t resemble its own potential energy either. Or its own performance, for that matter. What shape is a toggling? The continuity of process remains invisible and without resemblance, even as it takes actual shape. Its rendering visible is never without remainder, and it is the unseen remainder that is of the essence.
