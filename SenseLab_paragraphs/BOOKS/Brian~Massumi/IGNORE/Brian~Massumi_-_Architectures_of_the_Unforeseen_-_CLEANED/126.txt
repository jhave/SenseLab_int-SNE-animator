It is here that a certain biomorphism will be noted. The forms Lynn generates do suggest organic metaphors, not all as loaded as the suckling critic's penta-breast. Lynn doesn’t deny this, and at times will play along with it, as when he presents his design for the Yokohama Port Terminal as architectural “sushi.” Other designs might suggest foliations or invaginations, pseudopods or flowerings, budding and couplings. Metaphors happen.xxxviii
