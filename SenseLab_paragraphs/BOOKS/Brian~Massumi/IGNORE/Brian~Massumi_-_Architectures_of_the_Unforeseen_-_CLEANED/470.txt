The edginess, the artist says, is somewhat addictive. From nothing has come an intensity of inhabiting otherwise. Art without alibi – or art as the alibi for having no alibi for being where you are – becomes a veritable life-style, a way of life. This art of no reason gives a reason for living, one that is no less effective for being empty. The no-reason is: to keep on keep on going, always on to somewhere else, in attentive openness to the surprise of relation. This is not a justification. It is a journey whose continuing is its own end.
