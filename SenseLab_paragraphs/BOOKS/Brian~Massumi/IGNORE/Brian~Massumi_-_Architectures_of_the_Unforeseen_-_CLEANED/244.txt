The theoretical implications of this account of the phenomenal reality of the body are enormous – not least, as we will see, for the way it extends the body beyond its phenomenal appearance. For present purposes, it is enough to remark that work like Lozano-Hemmer’s addresses itself to the “kinesthetic amoeba.” Projecting the shadow of a participant’s movements onto a façade creates an eerie kinesthetic feeling on the wall. If the body’s feeling fills the whole of the kinesthetic field, then the body stretches onto the wall, where the eeriness is. “Not limited by a clearly defined surface,” tendentially unconfined by the “contour” of the skin, it is free to stretch its limits to the built surface. There, its amoebically extended movements mix with others’ words. Through the words, local concerns of participants in Graz and across the globe, along with alien memories past and future, expressing a plethora of similarly telescoping tendings, fall within the body’s amplified field. On the wall, the body’s “volume” merges movingly, verbosely into other tendings. No assignable boundary between figure and ground, just a surface of tendential fusion. What  is “performed,” literally, is the creation of a collective body, in pseudopod fusion, like microbe sex (with words for genes).
