More than four: the flag is not the only common substance pumped with procreative fluid. The motherland got a 'facelift' for American Independence Day in 1986: school children across the country were asked to contribute their lunch money to scrub and refurbish another spirit of America, chaste 'Miss Liberty.' The unveiling of the new and improved Statue of Liberty coincided with one of the peaks in Reagan's popularity. Reagan himself was the prime-time master of ceremonies for one of the most expensive and self-indulgent displays of patriotic fervor in living memory. "WOW!," ran a cover of Newsweek announcing a "Portrait of Miss Liberty on Her Birthday Bash" [14 July 1986]. In this and countless other exultant press stories, every alleged American virtue and victory was described as Miss Liberty's personal accomplishment. Reagan, a kind of spiritual bridegroom bathed in a fountain of youth of floodlights and fireworks, stood faithfully by her side--when he wasn't standing on her pedestal. A New York Times illustration of a statuesque Reagan wearing Miss Liberty's crown was a typical image of the period.2
