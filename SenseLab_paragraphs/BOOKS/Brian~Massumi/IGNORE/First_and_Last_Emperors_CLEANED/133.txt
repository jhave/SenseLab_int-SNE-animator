Each move to a higher unifying substance requires the new Number One to subsume all preceding terms. That substance must therefore subsume in one way or another its own conditions of emergence. Every image of unity contains within it a trace of the dialectic of immanence and transcendence that produced it. Since the dialectic takes the form of an alternation between a lack and an excess inscribed in the unifying substance, images of that substance will also alternate between those two poles.
