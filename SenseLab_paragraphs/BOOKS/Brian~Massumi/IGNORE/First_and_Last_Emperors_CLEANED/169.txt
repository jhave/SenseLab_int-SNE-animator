We charted three drives to unity, three becomings-immanent. Two were subsumed by a proper name--"Qin Shih Huang-di," "Reagan"--the third by an impersonal apparatus--the Bush-thing. The first two we called heteronymic, the third apparatic. The becomings-immanent subsumed first and foremost by a name seized upon markers of excess as a way of conjuring away the impossibility of transcendence. They were obsessed with the body, whose potential for death and dismemberment is a material reminder of the failure awaiting. The tension between excess and the body worked into a frenzy involving spectacular disappearances, in the first case through a mythic quest for the other in the doubled self (the monster) and in the second case on a televised celebration of the fragmented self in the other (mass media technology)--ways of enacting the multiplicity unseen. The becoming-immanent subsumed first and foremost by an impersonal apparatus was haunted by its own premonitory signs of failure. It seized upon these, accepting the role of remainder. It melted to the point of imperceptibility on one screen apparatus only to reappear explosively on another. "Reagan" and the "First Emperor" played out the Emperor's conundrum by spinning off series of doubles and fracturings. The Bush-thing favored straddling a single split, enabling a decisive blankness where once was a proliferation of meaning and image. Each of these kinds of becoming-immanent, of course, involve names and apparatuses, myth and celebration, doubles, fractures, and splits, and many other things besides: an infinity of components. It is a question of composition, of how the components hold together. Determination is extrinsic: it is in interrelatedness.
