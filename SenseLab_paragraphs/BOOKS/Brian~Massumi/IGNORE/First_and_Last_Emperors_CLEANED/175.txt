The history of the State is the story of its progressive separation from itself through a proliferation and increasing differentiation of the apparatus. The only linearity in State history is this steady intensification of the becoming-immanent of the lost sovereign, the relentless "endocolonization" of the earth by materialized pre- and exhuman functions.4 The First Emperor had a restricted number of apparatuses at his disposal: the army, the mutual-spying machine, agriculture, hydraulics and other public works, all under the control of an overarching bureaucracy. Reagan had variations on all of these, plus many more. He made masterful use of spy apparatuses, using intelligence connections to make the famous pre-election arms-for-hostages deal that won him the presidency by thwarting a Carter "October surprise." Once in office, he could not have "healed the wounds of Vietnam" and prepared the nation for the infinite dissemination of his glorious image without ample support from such domestic apparatuses as the mass media and the police machine he mobilized for the "war" on drugs.
