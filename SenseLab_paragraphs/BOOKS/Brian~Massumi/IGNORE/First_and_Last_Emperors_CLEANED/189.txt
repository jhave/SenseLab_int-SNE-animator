7. Anti-State. We can't offer any conclusions, in the sense of final solutions. Those we leave to men of State. We can only offer a desire, counter to theirs. We can only incant: don't turn back. Call the Bush-thing's bluff. Take the drive to unity out of the missile, and the missile out of the apparatus. Do not jog. Take the remnants of self out of machinic possession. Refind "one's" strength. Return force to potential, remainder to excess, history to its underside. As the failure of Enlightenment has shown, liberation is never of the human, it is only ever from it. Invoke the body without an image in a postgender, posthuman, sovereignless world--even in the uncertainty of where it will take us. One thing is certain: we won't have "Reagan" to reassassinate anymore.
