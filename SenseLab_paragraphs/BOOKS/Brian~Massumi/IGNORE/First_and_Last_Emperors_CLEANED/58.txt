National unity oscillates between paranoia and hypochondria. It is in any case a sickness. The hypochondria is written into the paradox of the substance of unity described earlier. A seamless whole has to have parts, otherwise it would have nothing to totalize; but it cannot have them, otherwise it would not be a seamless whole. The whole is continually undermined by its parts. The body politic is always under attack by its own organs in one form or another. That is why it has such a pronounced tendency to want to cut them off.
