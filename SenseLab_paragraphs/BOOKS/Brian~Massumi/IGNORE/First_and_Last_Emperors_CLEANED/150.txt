If the citizenry indulged in phallic phantasies in relation to Reagan's body, it was not likely to take the form of them imagining him having what they wanted. Rather, they became what he lacked. Whenever his anthem played, they would pop up proudly erect and pledge allegiance to his magic fabric. If dangerous marauders (like Grenada) loomed on the horizon, they would shoot off their missiles in eager defense of Miss Liberty. Reagan's followers, like Hitler's, stood in for his phallus, which was detached from his body and multiplied, as scattered as his TV image.
