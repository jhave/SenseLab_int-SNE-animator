3. First and Last. The repetitive difference of the State Idea means that its every incarnation is in a sense immortal--or always already dead. Take your pick. It could be argued that Ronald Reagan was already present at the foundation of the Chinese empire, or that he is an avatar of the "First Emperor": that he has been alive since the dawn of history, or has died countless deaths, from fishly suicide to a failed assassination that in a sense succeeded because he walked away from it the corpse he already was. It always comes down to the same thing: equating the population with a bounded space or territory, saturating the territory with executive apparatuses, beaming onto every resulting surface projections of a despotic body whose form embodies an idea of unity as it disappears, shattered, into a dialectic of transcendence and immanence. The Bush-thing involves all of these components, but in a different mix. It takes one of them to the extreme: the apparatus (in one of its many variations). Bush has also been to China. The characteristically imperial apparatus--the bureaucracy--is an Asiatic Bush-thing with many an American cousin.
