Reagan repeatedly drew attention to a structural homology between his body and the body politic ["Reagan's Nose Could Change the Whole Face of the World," International Herald Tribune, 10 August 1987]. Any difficulty he encountered was apt to be expressed in somatic terms. His triumphant first address after his assassination centered on a metaphor linking his recovery to that of the economy ["Reagan Appeals to Congress for His Economic Plan, Saying He Is Recovered but US Isn't," New York Times, 29 April 1981]. Criticism struck him physically, with hysterical regularity if not anatomical accuracy ["Reagan Lashes Out: 'There Is Bitter Bile in My Throat,'" Time, 8 December 1986, cover].
