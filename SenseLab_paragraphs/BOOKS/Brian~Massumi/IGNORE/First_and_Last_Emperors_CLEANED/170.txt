There is at least one other kind of becoming-immanent (and probably many more): what we called nomadic desire. The difference between the becomings-immanent of the State Idea and the becomings-immanent of nomadic desire is not that between reason and unreason, or between constancy and passion. All becomings-immanent are desires, in the sense of tendings toward: they are drives or vectorial dynamisms inhabiting the in-between of bodies, images, ideas, and words, and many other things besides. The difference is that the State idea becomes-immanent in the service of unity, whereas nomadic desire openly embraces that singular multiplicity its State nemesis admits only under duress, like a dirty secret.
