What at first seemed to be a simple, stable structure of three homologous terms turns out to be much more complicated. The would-be substance of unity takes its place in a proliferating series. It is as though the structure were undermined by an imbalance it could not permanently correct. A lack in the brute materiality of the three base terms is compensated for by a supplementary term operating in a higher dimension. The supplementary term succeeds in filling the lack; but it overfills it, turning it into an excess. The imbalance is still there, but has changed signs, from a negative to a positive.3 There is always a remainder of spirit that cannot be contained in a given substance of unity, and must therefore be absorbed by another: from flag to statue. The excess haunts the reunification series, turning up again at each successive term. Its omnipresence is acknowledged in an image of a life-giving fluid suffusing all solid states of unity, acting as the energetic principle of their serial progression. The minus sign of brute human existence has become a series of pluses embodying the flow of the American spirit in fateful progress toward the pinnacle of history. Progress as a serialized redundancy of Number Ones. Plus, double plus.
