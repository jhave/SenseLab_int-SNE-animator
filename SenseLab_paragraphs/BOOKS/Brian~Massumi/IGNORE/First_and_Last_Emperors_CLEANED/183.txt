Any counterstrategy to the Bush-thing based on a becoming-woman would short-circuit. The feminine is as much a part of the masculine system as the neuter. None of these terms have any meaning apart from the others. The masculine is the historically predominant human expression of the excess of transcendence (the phallus). The feminine is the historically predominant human expression of the remainder of immanence (castration). The neuter is the reversal point or the vanishing point of human transcendence and immanence: it is the point toward which the irresolvable dialectic of transcendence and immanence set in motion by the drive to unity leads, as if to its solution. But it is not the solution, only the human point of contradiction. If masculinity is the phallus, and femininity is castration, then the neuter is the cut of the knife, the blast of the missile. Masculine, feminine, and neuter are all part of the same system: the personified organism. If a body precipitates toward one of these terms, it inevitably carries one or both of the others with it, eventually rebecoming what it left, or being assailed by it, haunted by it at every turn. As long as there is personification and organism, there will be gender, and where there is gender, there is masculinity, and where there is masculinity, there is almost certainly a despotic body ready for launch. A further indication that the belonging-together of men and despotism is symbiotic rather than essential is the fact that a biologically female body can sometimes serve as the launch site. The Kuwaitis are building a museum for Margaret Thatcher--European "Reagan" turned tireless Bush-thing champion--to immortalize her pro-war activism.
