5. Masculine, Feminine, and Neuter. We noted a symbiosis between the masculine gender and the State-form. Despotism itself seemed best defined as privileging of maleness in collective symbolization and the preeminence of the masculine voice in collective ideation. We used the term symbiosis, and referred to the masculinity of the despot as a kind of home base to which his imagings and discourse, his vocal and visual bodily residues, return more often than not. These were ways of saying that the men and despotism go together almost without exception, that they belong with and to each other, but that this is more a complicity than the result of a shared essence: the relation between men and despotism is extrinsically determined. In other words, it is not a destiny. Bush's self-neutering in technology attests to that.
