Ventriloquism, lipsynching. Rites of possession. Bush made a career of repeating Reagan's moves. That is where the rest of "Reagan" went. Into Bush's body. Bush strove to make his personal space coincide with Reagan's virtual geography. Had Bush stood on his ground, he would never have had a chance. He was not 'presidential material.' So rather than trying to stand on his own two feet, he became "Reagan"s better half, patiently waiting by the White House door for the footfalls of his master's missing limbs. But Reagan's ghost deserted him in the fall of 1990 when he voiced his most famous ventriloquist phrase, almighty in its negativity but now flipped into the affirmative: "new taxes." Bush had just learned to talk in complete sentences and control his spastic oratorial style. He had become a man. A mere mortal, with an image problem. In other words, with an image. He momentarily lost what connection he had to the body without an image. He fell into direct speech in the first person singular. As a consequence, his popularity plummeted to historical lows from which only a well-timed enemy, obligingly supplied by Saddam Hussein, could rescue him.
