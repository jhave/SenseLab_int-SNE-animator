Like Reagan, Bush withdrew into an audio-visual relay. But where Reagan had disappeared into his own self-aggrandizement, receding flag-bedecked into an infinite feedback loop provided by television as political apparatus of entertainment, Bush took the country with him on a one-way ride to oblivion. The Bush relay consisted in a video-mounted missile superimposing its point of view on the home-viewer's set as it zoomed for the kill, followed by blackness, the mark of efficiency, as the target blew. Reagan disappeared into the disseminating entertainment screen, multiplying himself beyond measure in a burst of color. Bush stepped aside from it, making room for another screen, a targeting screen, fatal in its monochrome finitude. Of course, the oblivion that was screened was not Bush's or America's per se, but that of the "enemy," the tastelessly moustachioed Arab. But in a way it was Bush's: the missile screen was his proxy body, a graphic incarnation of the willingness to kill in the name of all that America stood for (in this case, the "democratic" principle of non-intervention that he had not long before flagrantly violated in Panama). Bush missile vision: the look of America at war, standing, living and killing, whatever, for "freedom."
