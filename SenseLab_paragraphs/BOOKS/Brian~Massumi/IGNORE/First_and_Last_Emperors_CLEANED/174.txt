The State Idea is always arriving, never abiding. In itself, it is outside time. It is eternal (or nonexistent, take your pick again). History lies in the alienation of the State Idea from itself: the apparatus is the history of the State. When we argued against evolutionary theories of social development, we said that the State and its transformations always arrived from outside, which we described as liminal, the in-between. That relational outside is the in-itself of force. The apparatus is an interiorization of force, its capture (regimentation, channelization) in the name of unity. Any capture leaves traces. As Foucault has shown, it is possible to use those traces to chart "genealogies" of institutions. It is possible to write history, but only if rupture is given precedence over continuity.
