His phallus was fuzzy. Reagan could play the role of a father figure. But when he did, he was more like everybody's uncle than a mighty patriarch. And as we saw at his home birth, he had a propensity to embody the motherland. As a matter of fact, he did not customarily have a penis. During his prostate saga, the New York Times published an anatomical chart of the presidential body [18 December 1986]. Despite the proximity of that gland to his alleged genital apparatus, the executive organ fails to appear. Reagan does get both an anus and a rectum, suggesting a tendency of the phallic to disappear into the anal. Reagan agenitality, however, just as often veered toward the vestal virgin roles of the Statue of Liberty genre. In anti-genital mode, he did not even tolerate the sexual activity of others ["Ardent Dogs Killed as Risk to Reagan," San Francisco Examiner, 19 October 1987].
