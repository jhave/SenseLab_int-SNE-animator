The question reporters were asking when Bush fleshed out the only good pun of his career was: are you or are you not going to propose the tax increase we read away last year on your lips? Running away with his hips earned Bush few friends. He had flip-flopped four times on the tax issue in the preceding week. The jogging, meant to signal strength and decisiveness, only embodied the side-to-side vacillation. That's when Bush's popularity fell sharply for the first time: 20 percentage points in one week. The pun came on October 10, 1990. Three months after that (a matter of days after Time magazine's analysis of how he dealt with his splitting image), the Gulf War began. The rest is history: that record-breaking 90 percent approval rating at the polls.
