2. Immanent and Transcendent. Another way of putting the Emperor's conundrum is to say that the whole is either apart from or a part of that which it unifies: transcendent or immanent. A drive to unity is by design apart from what it unifies, and by default a part of it--both by nature. The State-form attempts to elevate the world to a level equal to its unifying abstraction, but in order to do so it must concretize itself enough to move brute matter. Every whole is immanent in its transcendence. Transcendence is nothing other than a particular mode of becoming-immanent to matter.
