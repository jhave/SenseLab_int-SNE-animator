The Bush-body goofs, his voice gaffes. Bush-mind and Bush-body are never completely in harmony, however carefully scripted. He lacks a unifying will. His speaking style is to this day distracted. Despite his Ivy League past, Bush is painfully, embarrassingly, vomitously, down-to-earth. He's an ordinary Joe. The director of ABC's docu-drama of the Gulf War, "Heroes of Desert Storm," said that he asked Bush to appear because the film (which bombed) "was meant to be a salute to  the ordinary people who did extraordinary things" in the war, and he "thought having the president would be a nice touch" [The Arizona Daily Star, 6 October 1991, 4A].
