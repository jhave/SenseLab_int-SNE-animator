Reagan's body is struck with the same inescapable contradiction as that of the First Emperor.  It is trapped in a dialectic of immanence and transcendence that can have no synthesis. The closer the nation comes to embodying its own unifying subjective substance, the farther that substance recedes into another dimension, until it approaches the vanishing point. The more exalted the unifying substance, the more ethereal it is;  the more ethereal it is, the more painfully inadequate it proves in unifying the heterogeneous material terms for which it strives to provide a common substance. The unification drive leads only to disappearance and fragmentation: the physicality of the unifying body disappears, leaving only its image, which is then relayed to infinity, composed, decomposed, re-membered, and dismembered.
