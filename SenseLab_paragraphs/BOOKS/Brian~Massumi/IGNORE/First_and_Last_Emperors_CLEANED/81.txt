George Bush has the distinction of being the first candidate to win an election with a slogan he never spoke. "Read my lips" ("NO NEW TAXES"). Bush, lacking his predecessor's 'charisma,' resorted to reading his lines. It was Reagan who first rejected a tax increase by quoting Clint Eastwood (in 1985). A quote of a quote whose speaker remains unidentified: free indirect discourse. The 1988 campaign Bush, with his annoyingly squeaky voice and staccato, windmill-like gestures at the podium, was not a rousing orator. He had no choice but to be Reagan's "other fellow," to let himself be possessed of the spirit of Reagan-America, giving free indirect voice to it like a ventriloquist's puppet---turned ventriloquist. It was the voters who sounded the words. The most dramatic stage-event of his inauguration celebrations was a variation on Reagan's Statue of Liberty unveiling. As fireworks lit the sky, 40,000 picnickers on the Washington Mall brandished miniature flash-lights at an oversized statue of Abraham Lincoln (the "1000 points of light" of Bush's nomination acceptance speech of the summer before). Bush encored by singing along to a rendition of an obscure patriotic song by a second-rate singer (Lee Greenwood doing God Bless the USA). Barbara stood faithfully by her husband's side, wearing an American flag as a shawl. 'Old Glory' had figured prominently in the campaign. Bush's most successful issue after taxes was the pledge of allegiance to the flag. The bizarre but almost universal American ritual of forcing students to begin every school day by reciting, in unison with a recorded message piped into classrooms over a loud-speaker system, a pledge to give themselves over body and soul to the flag had been declared unconstitutional by a disloyal Supreme Court. Bush rose to the defense of the fabric the outgoing president had worn so well. ["More Flags Are Waving, as  Bush Encourages Patriotism and the Pledge," New York Times, 20 September 1988].
