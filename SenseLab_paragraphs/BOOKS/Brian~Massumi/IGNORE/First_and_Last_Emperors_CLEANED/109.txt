Much, of course, had happened to the Iraqis. The Gulf War was not Ballard's World War III. It was simultaneously less grand and a great deal bloodier than the fable: another difference between Reagan and Bush. Bush's splitting image freed him to kill with impunity on a much more massive scale numerically, but in a markedly less grandiose geopolitical frame than Reagan's mock-epic battle with an Evil Empire that barely outlasted his term in office. According to Pentagon estimates, a minimum of 350,000 Iraqis died during the war or in its aftermath, of which 200,000 were civilians ["Taking Stock," Montr√©al Gazette, 9 May 1992, B3]. It never sank in. Not even the haunting images of what Stormin' Norman called his "turkey shoot," when defeated Iraqi soldiers fleeing the rout in primarily civilian cars and trucks were picked off as they inched their way up the "highway of death" leading out of Kuwait. Miles of twisted wrecks dotted the landscape as far as the camera could see. Charred bodies were slowly covered by wind-swept sand, after being picked at by dogs with less discriminating tastes than modest Millie. No reaction. It was all on TV. Over and over again. At least as many times as missile vision. Still no reaction. No sadness. No second thoughts. No shame. No guilt. No sympathy.
