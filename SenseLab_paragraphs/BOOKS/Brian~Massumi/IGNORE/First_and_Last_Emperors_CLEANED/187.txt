6. Force and Potential. If apparatuses operate by capturing or interiorizing force, and if the relational outside is the in-itself of force, then the apparatus, in interiorizing force, alienates force from itself. Force = unbounded relationality = infinite connectability = pure potential: the capture of force is the reduction of potential. There is a reciprocal history to the State's progressive separation from itself through a proliferation and increasing differentiation of the apparatus: an equally complex separation of force from potential. What we called power. The actions of the State foster the crystalization of power, what Lord Shang praised as the "elimination of strength": regimentation, channelization, induction. Walls and roads, functionalized things and allegedly harmonious movement of bodies, utility and organism: these are power phenomena, left-overs of force, post-capture. They are remainders of unspent potential, traces of unknown excess, hieroglyphs of an unreadable history of rupture shadowing, shattering the continuities of State-crystalized powers, whose linearized histories they also write, in the same words, different language.8
