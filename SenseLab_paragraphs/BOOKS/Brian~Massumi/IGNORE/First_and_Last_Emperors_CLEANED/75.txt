To see yourself as others see you. But not as in a mirror. Not an inversion or reversal. A surrounding--of the body in motion. From all angles simultaneously, and in all qualities of movement, front, back, walking, standing. To leave "my" self-perspective, but not for "yours." Not for the Other's I; for others' eyes. To see oneself as "one" would see one: an impersonal (objective) perspective conceivable only as the sum total of subjective perspectives. To be the division, not only between the "I" and the "you," but between all I's and all you's at once. To be "one"--in all its multiplicity. Unity as a supertopological overlay of all possible inter-geographies of bodies in motion. Subsumed by a name.
