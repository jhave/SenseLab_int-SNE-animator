As if to underscore the difference between the two presidents, George fell sick after the cessation of hostilities, perhaps spent by the effort of golfing in wartime. He did not even manage to be original at illness. The major health event of his presidency was the onset of Graves disease, a condition that had already been diagnosed in Barbara. Although lacking in originality, Bush's malady did have an element of mystery to it. The exact cause of Graves disease is unknown. The statistical chance of two people unrelated by blood developing the disease is infinitesimal, so even though it is generally accepted that it is not contagious, the press of late May-early June 1991 was filled with rumors about a hidden carrier. Suspicion immediately fell upon Millie. Some argued for the First Dog's innocence, blaming an unknown environmental factor at the Vice Presidential mansion (which, incidentally, raised the specter of Dan Quayle being similarly stricken). The insistent protest by doctors explaining that Graves was not due to environmental factors any more than it was contagious went unheard. In other words, Bush was not suffering from his eight years playing second fiddle to Reagan any more than from over-familiarity with his dog. The disease had no meaning and no cause. Reagan's infirmities, by contrast, had a surplus of meaning and multiple yet specifiable causes. "Reagan" is a dirty joke. Bush, at best, is a banal mystery.
