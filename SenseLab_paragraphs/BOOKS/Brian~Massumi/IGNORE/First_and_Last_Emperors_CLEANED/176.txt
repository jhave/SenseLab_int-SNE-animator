Two of the "First Emperor" apparatuses that have been hyperdeveloped under late capitalism are the army and the mutual-spying machine. Variations on each abound. Both are being technologized, relegating human perception and judgment step-by-step to the periphery of integrated circuits acting more and more automatically: poll responses relayed into computer analysis relayed into the mass media; satellite spy images relayed into computer analysis relayed into missile guidance systems. As human mental and perceptual functions are supplemented or even supplanted by technological translations of them, the leader and his subjects become increasingly peripheral to their own activities. The apparatus is expelling them. The human is less and less central, occupying instead the end-points of autonomic circuits: the human gives the poll response, and receives the results in the next day's paper; a human presses a button and a "soft target" blows up. It is the humans who are at the extremities of the apparatus, rather than the apparatus serving as the right hand of the exemplary human. Each autonomic circuit peripheralizes the human only in order to connect through that human end-point with itself, initiating its next operation cycle: the publicized poll results feed back into the next opinion poll, making or breaking a political career; satellite-gathered information on missile hits and misses feed back into the next push of the button and the next "soft target" blows. The space of human intervention is reduced to the minimum, to instant reflex action: a canned answer to a prepackaged question; a programmed gesture urgently responding to incoming information.
