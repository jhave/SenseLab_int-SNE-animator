A Bush without a Gulf War is like a pilot without a raft. Less than one year after the foreign Persian Gulf Crisis, on the eve of the election season that was to feature its home-front reprise, Bush's popularity rating had plunged from a record-breaking 90 percent to a miserable 37 percent [CBS-New York Times poll released 25 November 1991]. The education-thing reared its ugly end zone again. A student at a televised school meeting asked a question out of order, but Bush went on following the script. "I don't listen to the question. I just look at this," he explained, referring to his answer sheets. Everyone knows these meetings are scripted, protested his press secretary. Why the big fuss? After all, Reagan did it and nobody minded. ["Foot-in-Mouth George Reveals Gift of Gaffe," The Australian, 29 November 1991]. Then Bush erred by departing from the script. He ad-libbed during a speech prepared by then chief-of-staff John Sununu, suggesting a ceiling on credit card interest rates. The next day, the stock market dove, deepening an already serious recession. Bush tried to pawn it off on Sununu, claiming it had been in the script all the time. Sununu contradicted him on national TV, and was promptly sacked, a victim of Bush's ill-considered attempt to speak for himself. The rigors of the early 1992 Presidential primary campaign made effective post-Sununu rescripting impossible. Bushspeak resurfaced with a vengeance.21
