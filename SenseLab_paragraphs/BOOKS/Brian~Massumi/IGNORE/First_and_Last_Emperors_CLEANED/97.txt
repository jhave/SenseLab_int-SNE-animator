Old Glory's magic dust didn't stick to Bush's lapels. Try as he might to pledge himself to it, it fell from his shoulders like dandruff. Whenever he drew attention to himself, it was in a way that highlighted his inability to rise above, or even remain seated--to maintain his presence at all. For example, Bush could never garner for himself the kind of political capital Reagan did with second-hand war stories, even though he had a true one to tell. Bush actually was a fighter pilot in World War II. The story he tells is about being shot down. It ends with him floating aimlessly in a little yellow raft thinking wistfully about his family as he waits for rescue. In his hour of danger, a raft away from death, the thought of family did not unify the Bush substance(lessness) with that of the nation, as it had for Reagan reminiscing about his birth; rather, it led him to reflect on "my faith, the separation of church and state."17 Church/state ... mind/body, spirituality/materiality, self/other. This split, which Reagan tried so hard to overcome, was a given for Bush, his "faith." It was his ultimate element, his destiny, it was to Bush what the sea was to his doomed fighter plane.
