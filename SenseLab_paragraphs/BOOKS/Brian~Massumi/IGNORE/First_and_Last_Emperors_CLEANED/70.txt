It is perhaps less useful to say that Reagan was neither a father figure, a phallus, nor a simulation, than to recognize that he was all of these things. He was not fundamentally an actor in a family romance projected on a nation, nor the constitutive agent of an intersubjective structure of lack-in-being, nor a hyperreal optical effect. He was a surface on which all of these processes had equal play, like different channels to which a viewer's brain could turn as at a press of the remote control. His screen-body was the interface in a many-dimensioned interactive medium.
