"One of us." A hero of the ordinary. Floating in the Patriot sea. Immersed in separation, the perceived separation of mind and body, the absence of a strong persona. The inevitability of goof and gaffe engulfing Reagan's hapless successor condemned him to abject immanence in the familiar, imperfect, everyday world. When Bush did manage to rise above, he did it by temporarily reversing the direction of the slide into immanence without, however, transforming it into a climb to transcendence. The colors of the Reagan-American flag ran in all directions. The Gulf War Bush-bomb went air-borne. But it rose only in order to zoom back in, converging explosively with the vanishing point at the center of the militarized home-viewing screen. At which point it became blankly apparent that Bush had missed his own ride, that he was at no time any less earthbound for having fired his body-double missile than he was for piloting a plane.
