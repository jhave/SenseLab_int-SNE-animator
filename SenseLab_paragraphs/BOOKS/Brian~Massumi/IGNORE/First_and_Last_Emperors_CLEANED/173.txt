Call this excessive remainder of absolute immanence force. Force is not material in the sense of being a determinate thing. And it is not necessarily negative, or prohibitive. In fact, its prohibitive mode is a special case, an exception to prove the rule, which is creative--productive of difference. For force is relational, it is the very stuff of relationality: non-coincidence, differential, vector, less a thing than matter and energy at their point of indiscernability.2 Perpetual motion: as soon as a force exerts itself it has become other than it is, because its exertion alters the relationality it was. Not only is force not determinate, it is not determinable: it is the very movement of determination. It is becoming. No ruler rules without making his person coincide with selected forces gathered into an apparatus. But force is becoming, unruly. The ruler becomes-immanent in the territory to the extent that he alienates himself in an inorganic life he cannot hope entirely to control.3 The organic model evoked directly or indirectly by every image of State unity functions only to the extent that it is a becoming-inorganic: yet another expression of the Emperor's conundrum. He effectively commands only to the degree to which he unlives his and others' lives.
