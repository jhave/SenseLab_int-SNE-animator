America may get more than it bargained for if Bush really does turn his talent to domestic issues, as the prevailing political wisdom of the moment says he must to win reelection. For what he has done--or rather, a long-term process that has culminated during his presidency--consists in enabling a split between the leader's body/mind and the technological apparatus with which they meld but which continues to double them. Reagan's fracturing was an attempt to overcome just that split. His vision-thing was to personify the nation, to embody it, to give it voice--an unattainable goal in pursuit of which he lost himself in his chosen apparatus, the mass media. Bush, on the other hand, lost himself in a technological apparatus embodying an impersonal command function: computer-operated military hardware. It was not a side-effect of pursuing a higher goal; it was the goal. "I will not tie the expert's hands," Bush proudly and repeatedly declared during the Gulf Crisis and ensuing war. Political leadership cedes to technocratic control. Schwarzkopf stands as testimony to the fact that this command function can be personified. But only peripherally. Even Schwarzkopf had to stand aside when the videos came in, passing center stage to the high-tech equipment upon which his credibility rested in this push-button war headquartered hundreds of miles away from the front. The President turns control over to the experts, who turn it over to the machine.
