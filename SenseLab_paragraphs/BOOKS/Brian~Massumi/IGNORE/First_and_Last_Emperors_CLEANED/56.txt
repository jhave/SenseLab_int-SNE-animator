A consequence of the structural homology between the body of the unifier and the body politic it unifies is that the country sets up a defensive self-other boundary analogous to the skin. Any uncooperative element appears in one of two ways: as a rival body attacking boldly from without, threatening to pierce the body's protective shield; or as a disease that slips in through the pores to enter the country's bloodstream and sap its strength from within. The military-industrial complex under Reagan strove to produce a technological skin. Star Wars was to be a skin prosthesis made of lasers.
