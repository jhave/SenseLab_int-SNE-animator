Reagan's body functioned as a surface. There was no depth to it for an unconscious to hide in. The 'teflon president': all shimmering surface. As we have seen, a substance of unity functions by combining in a homogeneous medium heterogeneous terms drawn from a multiplicity of levels. It does that by extracting or abstracting certain qualities and not others, and projecting them onto a single surface. In Reagan's case, the qualities were predominantly visual, and the ultimate surface was the TV screen. That particular surface is almost omnipotent in its combinatory powers. Logical and symbolic associations pertaining to what psychoanalysis calls the secondary processes get equal billing with what normally would be considered primary processes. The primary processes become visible. Reagan's public pronouncements consistently displayed distortions characteristic of the dream-work. Nicaragua, for example, was displaced to a threatening position just south of the Texas border. Film and TV residue from past viewings were condensed into present perceptions, such as when Reagan called his dog Lucky  'Lassie,' or when he told a story about a heroic fighter pilot drawn from a movie he had seen as though it were a true story. In Reagan's America, the psychoanalytic distinction between the unconscious and the conscious, and the ideological distinction between the fake and the real, ceased to be pertinent.
