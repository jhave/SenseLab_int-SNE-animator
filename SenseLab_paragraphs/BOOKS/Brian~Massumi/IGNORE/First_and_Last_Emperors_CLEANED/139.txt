Reagan, like the First Emperor,  manifested his amputational nature by disappearing into his ceremonial residence. His mode of being in the White House mimicked the transcendental nature of the substance of unity he continued to be despite his tendency to lose bits and pieces of himself. His comment about building a Great Wall around the White House was directed at the press corps, which he was likening to invading Asian hordes--bothersome 'lice.' But it could just as well have referred to the ground-to-air missiles and elite combat units ringing the White House to ward off attacks by terrorist lice. Or to his increasing deafness ["Reagan's New Hearing Aid Has a Remote Control," San Francisco Chronicle, 11 February 1988] and the hearing aid he would shut off to avoid reporters' questions (as much a technological cure for hypochondria as a political ploy: "Reagan Feigns Laryngitis to Avoid Query" ran a pre-hearing aid headline, New York Times, 3 March 1985). Or to his overall lack of accessibility to the press--despite his reputation for being a media president, he had fewer press conferences than any president since the advent of radio. ["The Disappearing Presidential News Conference," New York Times, 17 October 1988, A20] Or to his ever-increasing aloofness and lack of engagement in the everyday running of the country ["President 'Strangely Passive,'" The Australian, 10 May 1988; "Memo Suggested 'Inattentive' Reagan Be Removed: Book," Montreal Gazette, 16 September 1988, A10]. Or his tragi-comic propensity to nap during meetings and international crises and his growing inability to distinguish politics from film scripts.6 When the body of unification is not being cut up, it is cut off, separating itself from that which it unifies.
