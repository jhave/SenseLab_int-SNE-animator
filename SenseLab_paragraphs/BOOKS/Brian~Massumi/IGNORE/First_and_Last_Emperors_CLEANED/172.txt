4. Alive and Unliving. The State-serving apparatus is the despotic expression of the impersonality of matter: the ordering voice of the "faceless" bureaucracy, the commanding might of the smart bomb's eyeless sight. The apparatus is matter that has been regimented as part of a becoming-immanent in the territory of the functions of the ruler, but which resists personification, in other words effective subsumption by a proper name. It is the inhumanity of the State, that which instrumentalizes State unity. Acting as the ruler's right hand without ceasing to be inorganic, the apparatus is an insistent remainder (excess) of absolute immanence. It is what the becoming-immanent of the ruler cannot entirely incorporate, but without which it cannot function. The ruler cannot act over a distance without the apparatus. Without it, his rule would not be the measure of the social field.
