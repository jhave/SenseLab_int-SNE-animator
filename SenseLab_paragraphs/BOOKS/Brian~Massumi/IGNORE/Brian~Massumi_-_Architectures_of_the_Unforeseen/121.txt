Put another way, what belongs?
	Not I. I'm a bad citizen, the artist confesses (with a twinkle in her eye). She never knew her place, she explains. The traditional role reserved for her by family and community as a Sikh woman was not one, from the earliest age, that she would allow to contain her. She was the unruly one. As a result, her community itself could not contain her. She would marry a Chinese Malaysian whose familiar postcolonial trajectory into overseas education, coupled with the ethnic tensions agitating the nation-building project of post-independence Malaysia, had left him a non-citizen in his own country, with only the passport of an adopted country to his name. With the resulting move to Australia the artist found herself the non-citizen, on top of the "bad" citizen she started out as. Her family had internalized the tension between citizenship and non-citizenship. It incarnated in its very structure the gap between being in a place and being of a place, between living there and belonging here. 
	Oddly, Australia itself seemed to echo this tension. "When I first lived here I used to imagine a vapour rising above the city, a confounded, teeth-gnashing, collective sigh of what am I doing here? and I added my angst to that imaginary cloud … In fact what I thought was my personal mantra – what am I doing here? – was something of a national chorus. I would say that this lament has a long lineage, probably going back to the time of white arrival and settlement."ii A cloud of agitation rising up from the city: in the eye of a storm, of impossible belonging. As the mine is to the open land, I am to the city (and the city to this nation).
