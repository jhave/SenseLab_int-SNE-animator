The art of this inhabiting otherwise is also strongly procedural. The collecting of little nothings provides the template for its procedure. Venturing out with open-ended attentiveness, coming back, and then going over the harvested traces with an abstract movement. The abstract movement will not be the minimal one of counting. It will be the more taxing one of reexpressing, through the traces, the lived quality of befalling that recommended them for harvesting in the first place. It will be a re-tracing of their happenstantial allure in an artistic movement of abstraction. The reexpression, although not minimalist, must retain something of the economy and neutrality of collecting's counting procedure. 
	This is not an art that starts with the adornment of a concept. The artist is acutely aware that she must beware of being led on by verbal propositions. It is necessary to be wary of words, because the weight of history and the authorized associations they carry predesignate a destination. For the surprise of connection to take – for being in place to take place – one must clear the way for it. Place must be emptied of the meanings already embedded in it. Otherwise, all paths will just lead back to designations that were already in place. To avoid this circular journey, the procedurality of the art process must take the lead. It must do so without the security of an alibi, without a framing concept or already elaborated analysis in place, with studied indifference to known categories.
