In the artist's home town of Port Dickson is found an oil refinery as well as the largest power station in peninsular Malaysia. There are also ancient cemeteries and shrines. Some of the shrines house rocks. Some rocks, we know, are deities. What makes a rock a deity, the artist asks? What gives power to a rock, and through it, to its place? What draws one in to the power of a place? 
	Whatever its nature, the draw in this case was not well disposed to respect the divisions of the official social order. The artist has an "alternate tour" of Port Dickson on which she likes to take visitors. One stop is a shrine next to the power station. It is dedicated to a paving stone. The stone is marked by a red spot, reminiscent of the bindi Hindus wear on the forehead. It also bears Chinese characters. Its power drawn in two traditions, wed together in this place. This syncretism is characteristic. Or was, in earlier times. Images of the Hindu god Ganesha are still to be found in the Chinese cemetery. A short journey away, near the border with the next state, there is a site where Chinese shrines, Hindu temples, and a keramat shrine of the local Sufi folk tradition honoring spirits of the land cohabit. Muslims no longer go there. The authorities, in the service of the State project of imposing a proper Islam more in line with the Saudi Salafist model, threatened to blow the site up if the worship continued. What was now deemed "proper" to this place swooped in from another place, half a world away. A power of a far-off place visited itself upon this place, to divisive effect, in the name of unity, of building a national identity to which it must belong. What is proper to an identity that divides? 
	What is proper to an identified place?
