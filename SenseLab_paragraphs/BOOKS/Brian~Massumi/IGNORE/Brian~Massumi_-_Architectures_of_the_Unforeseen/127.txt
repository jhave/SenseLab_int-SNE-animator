If it is, then the question "what am I doing here" cannot be construed as asking if I am where I belong by right of origin or reason of identity. As asked by the artist, it is the open question of how, wherever I happen to chance, I am dappled by my elsewheres as I go, and how I might dapple them back in my passing. To answer questions like that, you don't look inward and you don't look back. You just venture out again, and continue on your way. In search of little nothings. That way, you encounter "smll epiphanies." That is what the artist calls being taken by surprise by an unsuspected connection. A little joy of happenstance.
	Small epiphanies, unlike their Romantic or religious cousins, are mundane. They do not stand out from the everyday. They rise up into the everyday, from its refractive background. You wouldn't go so far as to call them sublime. They are not spectacular, but they do have a certain power. They have an allure, a drawing-in-ness, the artist will say. 
	What draws one in to the power of a place? Sometimes it's the little things, nothings really, more modest than even a minor deity. It is the this-worldly things with the unimperative allure of happenstance that softly, almost surreptitiously, draw one in.
