Our orienting abilities, then, combine the resources of two different dimensions of experience. The places we plainly see as we go about our daily lives are products of a cooperation between two sense systems. A synesthetic system of cross-referencing supplements a systemic duality, exo-referential and self-referential, positional and moving, Euclidean and self-varyingly monadic. Synesthetic cooperation links these dimensions to each other, always locally--specifically, where we are lost. This cross-sense referencing forms a third hinge-dimension of experience. This “lost” dimension of experience is where vision and conscious form-configuration feeds back into the vectorial tendency-plus-habit of proprioception, and where proprioception feeds forward into vision. It is where the two fold into and out of each other. It is this fold in experience.
