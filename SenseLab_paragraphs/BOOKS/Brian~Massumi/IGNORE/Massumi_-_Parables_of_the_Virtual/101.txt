The event lies at the intersection of at least two (and in reality many more) process lines. One is the adoption and imposition by the experimenter of the institutional set-up of the experiment, as defined linguistically, architecturally, and on any number of other interlocking levels. Call this the context. Context pre-exists. The possibility of maintaining objectivity in the face of surprise comes from the context’s relative stability as a more or less determinate given. The second process line is the self-insistence of an autonomy of experience. Reserve the term situation for the event of an autonomy of experience pushing into and moving across a context. The color-singularity, by virtue of its self-motivating experiential autonomy can, in and of itself, be considered a kind of impersonal subjectivity. The owned subjectivity with which the experimentee leaves--the public memory of having personally misremembered--is a contextual expression of the insurgent, impersonal subjectivity that is the singularity of color. The personal and impersonal poles of subjectivity lie at two ends of the same process line. At the beginning of the line, a self-activity pushes in from outside. By the end, that vivacity has settled into a stable structural coupling that gives it reportable meaning, as the asymmetrical opposite of the objective. Except that there is no beginning, because the insistent singularity is immemorial, arriving, as far as this context is concerned, out of nowhere. The beginning is an indeterminate givenness, which by virtue of its indeterminacy cannot be said exactly to have pre-existed. But neither can it be expected to end. The next time the subject remembers his friend’s face, those familiar eyes will still be too-blue. Think of Frank Sinatra. The structural capture of the vivacity of color co-exists with its continued autonomy: dead, objectified ... but still.
