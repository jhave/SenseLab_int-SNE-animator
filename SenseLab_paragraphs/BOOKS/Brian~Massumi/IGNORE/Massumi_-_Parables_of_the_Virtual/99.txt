If, in the interval between triggering and testing by “blue,” the subject is not doing what the experimenter is doing--setting up a correspondence between a past and present perception--then what exactly is he or she doing with color? Or is that even the right question? Isn’t the question rather: What is color doing to the subject? For the subject is not even aware of the excess she is producing until the experimenter reports the results. Until then, she is left in the belief that she has made the match. The exaggeration that she effectively produces is the result of some “absolutely striking” peculiarity of color. The subject has been singularly struck by color. Color has struck, and without either the subject or the experimenter willing it so, it has exceeded. It has gone over the instituted line, pushed past the mark set for it by the laboratory setup, as unwilled as it is unmatched by its human hosts.
