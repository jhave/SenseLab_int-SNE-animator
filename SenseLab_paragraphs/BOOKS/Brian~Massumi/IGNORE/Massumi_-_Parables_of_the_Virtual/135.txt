The very notion of cognitive overcoding implies that we orient with two systems of reference used together. The contradiction between them is only apparent. Pragmatically, they co-function. Visual cues and cognitive mappings function as storage devices allowing us more ready reaccess to less habituated proprioceptive patches. They also serve as useful correctives, when we find ourselves hallucinating buildings that positively aren’t there. The reverse is also true: proprioceptive orienting can act as a corrective to visual awareness. When we are momentarily lost, the buildings in front of us are in plain view. They may be strangley familiar, but we still can’t place ourselves. Oddly, the first thing people typically do when they realize they are lost and start trying to reorient is to look away from the scene in front of them, even rolling their eyes skyward. We figure out where we are by putting the plain-as-day visual image back in the proper proprioceptive sea-patch. To do that, we have to interrupt vision, in the same way visual awareness interrupts proprioception. The alarmingly physical sense we feel when we realize we are lost is a bodily registering of the disjunction between the two. Place arise from a dialectic of interference and accord between sense-dimensions.
