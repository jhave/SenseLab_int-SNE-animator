What would it mean to give a logical consistency to the in-between? It would mean realigining with a logic of relation. For the in-between, as such, is not a middling being, but rather the being of the middle--the being of a relation. A positioned being, central, middling or marginal, is a term of a relation. It may seem odd to insist that a relation has an ontological status separate from the terms of the relation. But it is in fact an indispensable step toward conceptualizing change as anything more or other than a negation, deviation, rupture or subversion. The terms of a relation are normally assumed to precede their interrelating, to be already-constituted. This begs the question of change, because everything is given in advance. The interrelating simply realizes external configurations already implicit as possibilities in the form of the pre-existent terms. You can re-arrange the furniture, even move it to a new location, but you still have the same old furniture. Assuming the precedence of terms in the relation is common to approaches characterized as empirical. Taking pre-given terms, extracting a permutational system of implicit positionings from their form, projecting that system to metaphysical point before the the givenness of the terms, and developing the projection as a generative a priori mapping--these moves are common, in varying ways, to phenomenological, structuralist, and many poststructuralist approaches. They retroject a stencil of the already-constituted to explain its constitution, thus setting up a logical time-slip, a vicious hermeneutic circle. What is given the slip, once again, is change.
