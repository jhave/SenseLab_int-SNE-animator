Which came first, the individual or society?
Which is the chicken and which is the egg?
Too much cultural and social theorizing has proceeded as if this were a reasonable place to begin. On one side are those who look first to the individual, and see feathers. When notions such as function, exchange, contract, or reason are used to explain the constitution of society, the individual is the chicken. The inaugural gesture is to conjure away society with the fiction of an atomistic flock of individuals who forge a relation with one another on the basis of a normative recognition of shared needs and common goods. These "foundationalist" approaches have been roundly criticized, in particular since deconstruction, for appealing more or less explicitly to a myth of origins. But what has not been remarked often enough is that approaches defining themselves against the individual-chicken wing in their own way just as foundationalist. Approaches privileging such notions as structure, the symbolic, semiotic system, or textuality look first to what the other wing puts second: an intersubjective frame. Society now figures as an a priori, a principle of intersubjectivity hatching individual subject-eggs. The "foundation" in this case is not a mythic origin, but a foundation it is nevertheless. It effects an inversion of the first foundationalism. The inaugural gesture in this case is to conjure away the individual, in order for it to return as determined by society rather than determining of it. The individual is defined by its "positioning" within the intersubjective frame. The foundation is transposed from a time axis to a spatial one, becoming topographical, the lay of the social land: we are no longer in the once-upon- a-time, but in the realm of the always-already. For in this approach, the individual is in a sense pre-hatched, since the topography determining it is itself pre-determined by a mapped-out logic of base-line positions, and combinations or permutations of them.
