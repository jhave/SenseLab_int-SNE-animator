One of the things that happens in the lapsing is a fiction. Libet determined that thought covers up its lag: the awareness is “back-dated” so that each thought experiences itself to have been at the precise time the stimulus was applied. Thought hallucinates that it coincides with itself. The simplest perception of the simplest stimulus is already a fairly elaborate hoax, from the point of view of a theory of cognitive authenticity that sees truth in plain and present reflection. To accept the implications of the Libet-lag, cognitive theory would have to accept that its own model is an even more elaborate hoax: a sophisticated version of thought’s self-coinciding, matter aside. The cognitive model would have to recognize that it too has been a matterful hallucination, on the half-second installment plan.
