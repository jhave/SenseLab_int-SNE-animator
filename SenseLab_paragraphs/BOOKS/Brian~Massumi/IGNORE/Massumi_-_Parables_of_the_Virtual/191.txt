When you place a brick next to another brick you are not placing matter against matter. You are placing effect against effect, relation against relation. You are building a conglommerate economy of movement. You are hinging molar stabilities to build larger molar stability. What we think of as Euclidean space is a mutual holding in relational stability of incorporeal event-spaces, relative to kind of movement, scale, and speed. Incorporeal: abstract. Euclidean space is the relative concreteness of the abstract. It is a certain kind of abstract-surface hinge-effect.
