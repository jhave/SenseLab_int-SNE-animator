The biogram is not lacking in order. It is over-organized, loaded with an excess of reality. It is deformed by experiential overfill. It is a hypersurface. Its hyperreality explains  why it is so stubbornly abstract. Since it cannot concretely hold everything it carries, it stores the excess fused in abstraction, ready for useful reaccess. In other words, the hypersurface of synesthetic experience is “real and abstract” in precisely the way Deleuze describes the virtual: as an intense, torsional coalescence of potential individuations. “Pulling out a thread,” or decompressing a differential strand of the fusional weave of experience, involves actualizing a virtuality. That is why the synesthetic perception is always an event or performance pulling determinate form and function out of a larger vagueness, like a rabbit from a one-sided hat.
