The point is that the idea that we live in Euclidean space and in linear time excludes the reality of change. The things with which mindful bodies interact, involuntarily and otherwise, also change. As do the buildings they live in or with. Things too coincide with their potential. Anything that endures, varies. Anything that varies in some way carries the continuities of its variations. The difference between minds, bodies, and objects are perhaps not as essential as philosophies stuck on the subjective-objective divide make them out to be. Perhaps it is not the presence or absence of any supposedly essential properties, for example consciousness or life, that distinguishes a mind from a body from an object. Perhaps they are distinguished modally, by their ways of carrying variation: by their different dopplerings of potential (different “speeds”).
