It has taken me many years to get used to seeing myself as others see me, and also seeing myself instead of my mental picture of the character I’m playing. First of all, very few of us ever see ourselves except as we look directly at ourselves in a mirror. Thus we don’t know how we look from behind, from the side, walk­ing, standing, moving normally through a room. It’s quite a jolt. Second is the fact that when you read a story you create a mental picture of each character. For the first few years this is true even in reading a script. You don’t see yourself because you haven’t had much experience in seeing yourself. Thus as you act the part, in your mind you envision your mental picture of the author’s character. You go to the rushes and somebody has stolen that heroic figure, and there you are‑-just plain old everyday you‑-up on the screen. It’s one hell of a letdown.
