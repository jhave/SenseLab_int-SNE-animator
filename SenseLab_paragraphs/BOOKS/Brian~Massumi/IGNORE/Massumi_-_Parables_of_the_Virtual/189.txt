Regulating movements is a question of scale and speed. An architect or engineer is not concerned with the swarming micro-movements of matter occurring in insane velocity at the molecular level of the materials used in construction. All that concerns her is that at a certain level those unpredictable movements settle into a dependable patterning. It is the undependable movementsâ€™ aggregation that can be depended upon: their manner of massing. The solidity of a brick is a mass mannerism, a crowd phenomenon: a molar relational effect.
