The synesthete uses her biograms, for example, to keep track of birthdays. On the birthday biogram, each region stores a conjunction between a date, a name, and a color. When she has to recall a birthday, she will use the color as a landmark, and when she approaches the right colored region, the name and date will appear. The shape and sound of the letters and numbers are stored in the colors, diaphanously merged into them as in a dissolve, or like strands “woven together” in a patch of fabric. They are accessed by a reverse dissolve that is like “pulling out threads.” Shape, sound, and language: of a fabric with color.
