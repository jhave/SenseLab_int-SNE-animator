Call this transsituational dimension of the differential object “blue,” by which it escapes confinement in its objectivity, its quality. Contextually, the object owes this elusive excess to an accumulation of familiarity and fondness that the triggering of the memory automatically brought to the situation. In other words, the quality is an expression of affective “investment.” The process line that jumps the interval from one situation to the next is a continuity of uncontained affect, pre- and post-personal. Affect is the connecting thread of experience. It is the invisible glue that holds the world together. There are, of course, other connecting threads. The interlocking pre-given levels mentioned earlier as defining the context also have their lines of continuity. These were levels of conventionalized discourse and institutional practices like architecture that are heavily discourse-delimited (following Foucault’s analyses). The continuity of these lines hinges on nominal identities. The discursive definition of a context delivers up already-identified differential objects for further growth. This evolution will take place within bounds of recognizability and predictability already implicit in the nominal identity. The circumscribing of evolution by discourse is precisely what makes the context useful--if a bit dead. The line of affect, on the other hand, carries unpredictability into the context, making it eventful. With affect comes vivacity of context: situation. Affect enlivens. Its situation-rocking transsituational drift is the life-glue of the world.xii It is the quality that gives affect its most direct processual expression in the situation. A quality is an expression of the world’s amalgamated liveliness.
