When you place bricks together to build four walls and then put a body inside, something similar is happening. The memories, habits, and tropisms the body carries with it, in the associated, intensive event-space of incorporeal or abstract movement evoked repeatedly in this essay, constitute an aggregate of relation. All the goings-on and passings-by around the building constitute another aggregate of relation: a sea of movements, each of which has a potential effect on the body, capable of modulating which determinate threads are pulled from the relational continuum it carries. Which threads the body re-expresses is regulated by the modulatory sense-interferences that the walls, doors, windows--not to mention screens and speakers--let pass. Certain tendential headings, perceptions, and cognitions are backgrounded, peripheralized, or blended out by the synesthetic economy of movement-across regulated by the architectural regime.
