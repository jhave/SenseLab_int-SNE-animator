Experience, hinging as it does on the pure potential out-leapt in the emergent sign, immediately enjoins a multiplication of process lines. Along those lines serially repeated contexts are strung. The contexts, which capture the potential for their own furtherance, are separated by gaps in expression. The gaps are glossed over by discursive groupings of contexts (and of their objective contents, and of their objectsâ€™ attributes), organized along axes of declared similarity (nominal identities standardly splayed across object differentials). The ingress of singularity, its expressive leap out of the gap of relation into a particular context or discursively-prepared interaction--this is sensation. Sensation: the ever-again of the never-before; the shock of vivacity; the eternal pushiness of the event-already.xv The rhythm of experience is punctuated by the transition-effect of the sensed, unforeseen. To the discourse-determined linearities of history glossing the gaps of emergence respond periodicities of renewal, unsayable even in their repeated committal to language.
