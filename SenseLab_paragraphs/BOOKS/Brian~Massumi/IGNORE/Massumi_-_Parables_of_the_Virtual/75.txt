Movement-vision is sight turned proprioceptive, the eyes reabsorbed into the flesh through a black hole in the geometry of empirical space and a gash in bodily form (the hole in Reagan’s stage bed; amputation). Vision is a mixed mode of perception, registering both form and movement. For it to gain entry into the quasicor­poreal, the realm of pure relation­ality, pure movement, it must throw aside form in favor of unmed­iated participation in the flesh. Movement-vision is retinal muscle, a visual strength flexed in the extremities of exhaustion.
