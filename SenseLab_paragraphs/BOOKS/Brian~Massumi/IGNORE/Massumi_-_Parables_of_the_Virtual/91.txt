PASSAGE PRECEDES POSITION.
Rethink body, subjectivity and social change in terms of movement, affect, force and violence – before code, text and signification. These latter reiterate ar­rest (the Law: where bodies cease, only to mean, and where meaning carries a sentence).
Even an arch-conservative politician can see and reach beyond the law long enough to catalyze a movement. A special case of reiterative movement (that allowing misrecog­nition: of the fractured time of the virtual for future Unity). This is becoming‑-against itself, because subsumed under that Ideal. Against itself, because its self-assigned meaning (“our Unity!”) contradicts its own senseless, eminently effective, rallying cry (“the rest of me?”). Remember the becoming-Reaganoid of America through the 1980s. And well beyond.xxiv Remember how one bad actor shed his self-likeness to steer a nation sameward. This is becoming – at once highly virulent and self-arresting. 
What is left of us, after “our” unity has completed “his” amputation?
Do we, cultural theorists, recognize ourselves in the rushes?
Rig writing, unarresting.
DISSEVER THE IMAGELESS FROM THE IDEAL.
