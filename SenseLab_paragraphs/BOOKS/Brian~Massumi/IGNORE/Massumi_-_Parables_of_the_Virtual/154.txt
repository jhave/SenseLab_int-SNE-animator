That the personal is the finale distinguishes this synesthetic ontogenesis of experience from phenomenological approaches. For phenomenology, the personal is prefigured or “pre-reflected” in the world, in a closed loop of “intentionality.” The act of perception or cognition is a reflection of what is already “pre-” embedded in the world. It repeats the same structures, expressing where you already were. Every phenomenological event is like returning home.xii This is like the déjà vu without the portent of the new. In the circus of synesthesia, you never really know what act will follow. The rabbit might turn into a dove and fly away. Experience, normal or clinical, is never fully intentional. No matter how practiced the act, the result remains at least as involuntary as it is elicited. Under the biogrammatic heading, the personal is not intentionally prefigured. It is rhythmically re-fused, in a way that always brings something new and unexpected into the loop. The loop is always strangely open (with just one-side, how could it ever reflect itself?).
