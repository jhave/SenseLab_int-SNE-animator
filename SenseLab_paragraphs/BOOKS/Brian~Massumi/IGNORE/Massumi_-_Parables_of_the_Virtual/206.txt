It is only by asserting the exteriority of the relation to its terms that chicken and egg absurdities can be avoided, and the discussion diverted from an addiction to foundation and its negation to an engagement with change as such, with the unfounded and  unmediated in-between of becoming. The need for this diversion is nowhere more evident than in terms like "body" and "culture" or "individual" and "society." Is it possible even to conceive of an individual outside of a society? Of a society without individuals? Individuals and societies are not only empirically inseparable, they are strictly simultaneous and consubstantial. It is an absurdity even to speak of them using notions of mediation, as if they were discrete entities that enter into extrinsic relation to one another, let alone to wonder which term takes precedence over the other in determining stasis and change. If they cannot be seen as terms in extrinsic relation, then perhaps they can be seen as products, effects, co-derivatives of an immanent relation that would be change in itself. In other words, they might be seen as differential emergences from a shared realm of relationality that is one with becoming. Seen from this point of view, the "terms" might look very different, to such an extent that it might be necessary to redefine them thoroughly, reconfigure them, or perhaps forego them.
