Biograms cannot be described without resorting to topology: centers folding into peripheries and out again, arcs, weaves, knots, and unthreadings. Face it. That is to say, you are always facing it. Wherever you are, whoever you are, whatever day or year it is, the biogram is in front of you. The synesthetic form of experience is faced, in something like the sense in which writing is handed.ix Except that a left has a right, and this front doesn’t have a back (yet still has shadow). This means a biogram is a one-sided topological surface--really, strangely, usefully. This is not a metaphor. If there is a metaphor in play, isn’t it rather mathematical representation that is the metaphor for the biogram? The biogram is a literal, graphically diaphanous event-perception. It is what is portented when you remember seeing time in space.
