Bedded in passivity, Reagan cannot jolt himself out of his condition. He is freed from the body without an image and returned to the everyday world, albeit a changed man, by the words of another called out as a cue: “Action!” Call the cue-call an order-word. Call the question-response an expression – keeping in mind that the express­ion is precon­ceptual and even presubjective, more an existential cry than a communication. The expression is the unmedi­tated and unmediated speaking of the event by the flesh. It culminates Reagan’s trans­form­ation into half a man. It gives him a demi-self. What it expresses is less an idea or an emotion formed by a signifying subject than an ontological problem posing as an open question the very possibility of constructing such a subject. Feelings and ideas will follow from the expres­sion and, before solving the problem it poses, will develop its problematic nature even further. The line Reagan speaks makes him feel like a cripple, and gives rise to the idea that he has become a semi-automaton. He has found half of himself, but he happens to have found it in the “body of another fellow.” He is on the road to completing himself, to identifying his body, but he got there by mouthing a pre-scripted line that made him into a foreshortened other. Many secondary questions arise. All of them can be condensed into one: how can exalted difference be derived from banal repetition? Repeat: how can a difference born of becoming-other be self-identity? Again: how can higher being arise from abject becoming?
