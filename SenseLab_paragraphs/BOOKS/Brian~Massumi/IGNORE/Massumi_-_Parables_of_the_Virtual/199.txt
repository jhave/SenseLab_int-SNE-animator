Look only at the movements--and they will bring you to matter. The  perspective suggested here displays a tropism toward realist materialism (without reflection: especially not “pre-”). At virtually every turn in the discussion, dynamics that seemed “subjective” to the extreme made a literal end-run back to impersonal matter. The end-run of mindedness back to matter always somehow coincided with its emergence from it, the exemplary case being Libet’s feedback loop between the dawning of perceptual awareness and the ever-present previousness of movements of brain matter capable of coloring experience without themselves becoming aware. Accepting this insistence of the material and impersonal (the “involuntary”) in bootstrapped personal experience distinguishes the current account most sharply from phenomenological approaches. Its claims both to realism and materialism paradoxically depend on it--paradoxically, because the “backdating” of matter-driven consciousness is also an argument that there is no essential difference between perception, cognition, and hallucination. This is a realist materialism with a paradoxically creative edge, summed up in the mantra: involuntary and elicited (autopoietic).
