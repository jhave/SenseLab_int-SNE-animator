This marks the end of the first phase of the process. The second begins with a “deception” prepared without Reagan’s knowledge and to which he is passively subjected. He is loaded into a “rig,” a bed with a hole in it to conceal his legs. His activity in the real world is now suspended by artifice; his anticipation of the event is turned into dramatic suspense as he sinks, quilted, into the scene. Will it happen? For a painful hour, he contemplates his torso. A feeling slowly wells within him. The time of contemplation is like an infolding of his previous activity. As if all of the relative perspec­tives he placed into communication were overlaying themselves on one another and on the disjunct but encompass­ing perspec­tives of the before and after between which he now lies suspended. In this state of suspended animation, he is more than himself, but less than whole. His eyes close. “Action!” His eyes reopen.
