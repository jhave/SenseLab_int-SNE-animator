It’s very simple. The researcher asks a subject to match the blue of a certain friend’s eyes. The friend, of course, is absent. The procedure is repeated with the black of the subject’s hat, the red of his own lips, the brown of the bricks of the house he lived in. The idea is to test the effect of memory on color constancy. The researcher is David Katz, working in the first decade of the century.
