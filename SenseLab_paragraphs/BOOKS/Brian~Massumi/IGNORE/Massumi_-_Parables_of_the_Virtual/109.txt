When the feat has been accomplished, a life cycle has been completed. A stream of experience has, in James’ and Whitehead’s vocabularies, reached a “terminus.”vii It is important to reiterate that a “terminus” of experience is neither a beginning nor an end per se. Once again, it is a threshold. The object has an afterlife. A technical object continues to evolve, but within the bounds of its definition. It changes, but not noticeably enough to merit a new official name. If it does jump the bounds of its nominal identity, it is because an event has transpired. Something new has arrived in the world. In a very particular context, a new singularity has irrupted, making the context a genitive “situation” again. “More” has come. A new life: more to reality.
