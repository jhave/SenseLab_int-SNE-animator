in ROUND-UP--intro distinction between signal (culminating of a process of preparation, and inductive of the prepared event) and sign (beginning of a process of abstraction = deterr: level of organization among deterr'd signals--semiotic image systems, language--can be inductive, as disseminated and reimplanted; always transductive [although transduction is not limited to this level, eg player's body, sensation as undeterritorializably transductive])--sign and signal are two axes, most often both functions fulfilled at once--these two do not in te least exhaust the differentiations of signs
