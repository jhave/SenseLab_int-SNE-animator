The anomalous memory-color, for its part, was self-sparking. It is true that it enjoined other lines of process and entered interactions underway, furthering them, unforeseen. But it was unbidden. It was not pre-defined by the context’s type and predictable interactions. If the memory-color was an effect, it was directly that of a self-relationality of color dimensions: a belonging of color to its own peculiarities and vivaciousness. If the memory-color was a content, it was that of a self-active process, a process noncontextual (if invasive of context): purely situational. If the memory-color was an attribute, it was purely that of a potential, rather than of any recognizable object, differential or otherwise. In other words, the “ingredients” and “interaction” it emerged from were virtual. A memory-color, emergent, has all the reality of a spark (and no more). The belonging-together of which it is an expression is virtual, in itself imperceptible. The coming-to-expression of that imperceptibility ended in the actual color-patch selected by the experimentee to stand for the experience in the present, public context. The unseen genesis of that coming-to-an-end was an unmatchable, nonconscious, impersonal, self-expressing autonomy of relation: a “singularity” of no present, neither personal nor public.
