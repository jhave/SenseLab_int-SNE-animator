Phase three. The suspension of the suspense by the director’s signal transports him across a blackout of vision into the space of transform­ation. The feeling that was welling inside his body bursts forth in a gesture and a phrase. He bolts up, crying his line. At that moment, he enters the body of another fellow. It’s for real (short of actual). This time, he cannot recog­nize himself in the rushes.
In a way, it is both real and actual. Reagan has been changed by the experience. An actual event really did occur. He feels afterwards that as an actor he is “only half a man” (6). He is cut to the quick by his moment of triumph. The event he recreated has bled into his everyday life, coloring it forever. Reagan laments that he has “become a semi-automaton” (6), and will remain one as long as he is just an actor. The autonomic repetition into which he collapses during the preparatory phase leading up to the event has carried over into his everyday life. He can’t go on that way. He resolves to find the rest of him. He will look for it in conserva­tive politics.
If the event was in a sense real, and if it made him a semi-automaton,  does that mean that finding the rest of him entails becoming a complete automaton? The question is answered by his subse­quent career.
