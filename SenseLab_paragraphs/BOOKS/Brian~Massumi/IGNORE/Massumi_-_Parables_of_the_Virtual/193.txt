A building is a technology of movement--a technology of transposition--in direct membranic connection with virtual event-spaces. It functions topologically, folding relational continua into and out of each other to selective, productive effect. It functions abstract-concretely to inflect determinations of potential experience. A building is an experiential supermodulator device: a modulator of modulations. It is a way of placing relation against relation, toward inflected variation. Its 3-D closure effect is a regulated coupling between virtual seas of relation, swarming and smudgeable. We build in Euclidean space when we design the kind of aggregate hinge-effects between swarmings and smudgings of experience that shake out in favor of maximum stability of cognitive result  (“there’s nothing like home”: recognition). To build in Euclidean space is to build in predictability.
