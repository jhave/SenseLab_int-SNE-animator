	This is the only way to play. For potential is the space of the play, not a motley collection of already-constituted objects on a stretch of turf. Potential is inseparable from constituted objects, but is not them. Potential movement or potential energy is logically and ontologically distinct from objects that move, and through which it discharges.
In the interplay of the substantial elements as they circuit into and out of their collective becoming and the empirical history doubling it, potential emerges and is contained.
