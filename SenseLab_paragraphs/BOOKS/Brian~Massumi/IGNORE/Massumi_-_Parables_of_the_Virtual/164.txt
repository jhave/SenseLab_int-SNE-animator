How complex a recursive duration it is only started to emerge later. Libet found that stimuli applied during the thought-o-genic lapse could effect the outcome. You’d think that a stimulus applied at the quarter-second would have to wait till three-quarters of second were up to make its mark. It would come in orderly succession after the half-second awareness emerging from the first stimulus. That way you’d get a reasonable succession of discrete perceptions or cognitions, even though each would still be a bit of a cheat by virtue of having backdated itself. The backdating would just be a quantitative peccadilo, a simple, measurable lag we might find it in our cognitive selves to forgive our brains for. But if the intervening stimulus affects the outcome of the first, then things get much less reasonable. If a later stimulus can modulate an earlier one before it becomes what it will have been, the recursive durations start to meld together. Experience smudges. You get a thirdness: a supplemental effect not reducible to the two stimuli’s respective durations considered separately. You get a supernumerary difference, a qualitative difference arising from the interrelation of recursive durations. To put it bluntly, you get a relational time-smudge. A kind of hypertime. Since any lapse of time is infinitely divisible, and at every instant there must be some kind of stimulus arriving through one sense channel or another, if you try to fill in what happens in the half-second lapses of awareness, things get downright hallucinogenic. At .01 seconds a second loop begins; at .02 seconds another begins ... but at .015 seconds there will have been an intervening beginning, and also at .0125. You’re left with an infinite multiplication of recursively durational emergent awarenesses, madly smudging each other. You get an exponentially self-complicating relational mess.
