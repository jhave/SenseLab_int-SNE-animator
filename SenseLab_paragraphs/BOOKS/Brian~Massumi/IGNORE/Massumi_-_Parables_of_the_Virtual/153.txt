Reaccessing the biogram and pulling a determinate strand of organized experience from it is to reapproach the point where the materiality of the body minds itself. It is to catch the becoming-minded of the movements of matter in the act. It is to re-perform the immemorial trick of experience pulling itself rabbit-like out of the black hat of matter. This is quite an ontogenetic contorsion. It involves a hyperreal looping between the impersonal and the “peripersonal.”. It is out of that non- to near-personal loop that a personal strand as such is pulled, at the grande finale. After which there is nothing to do but introduce the next abstract act.
