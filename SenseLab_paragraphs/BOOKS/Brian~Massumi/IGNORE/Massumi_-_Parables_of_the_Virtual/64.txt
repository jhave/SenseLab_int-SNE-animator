“Wan and worn” from a sleepless night, a despairing Reagan stumbles into the studio for the shoot: I found the prop men had arranged a neat deception. Under the gay patchwork quilt, they had cut a hole in the mattress and put a supporting box beneath. I stared at it for a minute. Then, obeying an overpowering impulse, I climbed into the rig. I spent almost that whole hour in stiff confinement, contemplating my torso and the smooth undisturbed flat of the covers where my legs should have been. Gradually, the affair began to terrify me. In some weird way, I felt some­thing horrible had happened to my body. Then gradually I became aware that the crew had quietly assembled, the camera was in position, and the set all lighted.... There were cries of “Lights!” and “Quiet, please!” I lay back and closed my eyes, as tense as a fiddlestring. I heard [the director’s] low voice call, “Action!” There was as sharp clack which sig­naled the beginning of the scene. I opened my eyes dazedly, looked around, slowly let my gaze travel downward. I can’t describe even now my feeling as I tried to reach for where my legs should be.... I asked the question – the words that had been haunting me for so many weeks – “Where’s the rest of me?” There was no retake. It was a good scene and it came out that way in the picture. Perhaps I never did quite as well again in a single shot. The reason was that I had put myself, as best I could, in the body of another fellow.... No single line in my career has been as effective in explaining to me what an actor’s life must be.... Seeing the rushes, I could barely believe the colored shadow on the screen was myself.
