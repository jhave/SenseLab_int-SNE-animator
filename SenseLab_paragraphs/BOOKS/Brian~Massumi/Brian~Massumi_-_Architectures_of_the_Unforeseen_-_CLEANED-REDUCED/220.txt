Not even the environment is “dematerialized” in the sense in which cyberpunk wished to dematerialize the body. It is not lost, or left behind. All of Lozano-Hemmer’s work takes great pains to bring local historical and social determinations into the performance. But it does this in order to connect them to “alien memories” which concern the site but are uncontainable within its confines. The internet discussion appearing on the Graz Landeszeughaus used the building to connect the forgotten medieval fears of plague and threatened invasion to contemporary fears of a different order and magnitude. These are “decentered, distributed phenomena or syndromes” that are difficult to attribute to a single cause (God’s wrath, the invading Turks), attaching instead to elusive risk factors that can only be grasped statistically. They operate at the extremes of scale: at microscopic levels below the threshold of the human (AIDS, genetic modification) or at a planetary level beyond the control of the State, the largest “local” level of human organization (global warming, transnational migration). Risk is in a mode of futurity. It hangs over the moment without ever surrendering itself to it, ever-present alien. It is an impending you cannot forget: an alien “memory” of the future. In “Tele-absence,” contemporary modes of fear connect across the façade of the building with their historical counterparts: memories of the past, alien by forgetting. Forgetting, not being able to forget; the historical past of the present and the ever-present statistical future; the below and the above of the human scale; the medieval arsenal and the postmodern State ... These connect with each other and with the everyday movements of the body acting in measure with itself, on the ground before the façade and amplified on it, projected into direct connection with the monumental scale of the built and the immeasurably proliferating world-wide network.
