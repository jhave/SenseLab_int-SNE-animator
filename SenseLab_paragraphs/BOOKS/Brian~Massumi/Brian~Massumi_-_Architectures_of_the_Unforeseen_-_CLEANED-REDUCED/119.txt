What is the analog of a sailboat’s hull for a building? Perhaps the use of interactive materials whose performance changes in response to variations in light or temperature. But isn’t that missing something? That kind of dynamic variability operates in the absence of anyone in or around the building. A building without human bodies is like a sail without a wind. Is there a way of making the process continue in relationship with the turbulent forces of the human body? Potential energy may be a mode under which virtuality passes into the actual. But it is not the only one. In fact, it is arguably the lowest degree of the virtual in the actual. The potential it packs into form is restricted to variations on extended movement, lending itself to a necessarily a limited number of selective postures. How can that envelopment of potential be reintensified? For example, what virtual powers might be accessed in connection with the human body’s forces of perception, sensation, and expression? Is there a way to build in potentials for variation that fold out in other ways than extended movement? That imbue form with even greater dynamism and multiplicity – without falling back on metaphor and its resemblance-trafficking co-conspirators?
