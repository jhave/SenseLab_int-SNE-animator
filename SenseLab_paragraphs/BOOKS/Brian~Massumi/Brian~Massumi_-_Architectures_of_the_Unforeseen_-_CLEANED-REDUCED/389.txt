"Life," Vološinov remarks, "begins only at the point where utterance crosses utterance."lx The life of the social is where words co-generatively react upon words. The mutual reaction of words upon each other survives in shriveled trace form even in the public sphere, in the way in which every expression "constitutes a germ of a response."lxi If the present act of expression constitutes the germ of a response that may come next, then it stands to reason that it was itself a response which a preceding expression likewise contained in germ. But might not that preceding expression very well have germinated into more than one response? There is, after all, a whole population of individuals co-habiting the public sphere. Could not that ancestor expression have contained two germs? Or three? Or four? Or n ... Each expression is an infectious forking of the paths of sociality away from well-regulated call-and-response into a potential infinity of lines of transmission. In all that complexity, how could the lines not get tangled? How could each act of expression not resonate with any number of others? Is it not undeniable that every romantic pop song lyric is filled with the echoes of any number of other love songs, as if it were citing them en masse in its specific difference, as an individual variation on their never-ending, ever-branching collective theme? Is it possible to hear an individual political position-taking without a ring of the déjà-heard? The regulation of the public sphere is designed to background this endemic third-party noise on the line as much as possible, holding it to a residual minimum in order to safeguard the private/public split, its accompanying forms of individual recognition, responsibility and ownership, and their historic deadening of expression. But neither the deadening of the social nor the implosion at the end of the social were ever total.
