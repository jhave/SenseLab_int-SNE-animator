Vološinov saw something similar happening in the nineteenth-century bourgeois novel, already chomping a the bit of the well-regulated bourgeois individual, under cover of art. A new mode of reported speech came into prominence. The conventional markers that formally separate the reported speech of a character from the author's reporting speech in traditional indirect discourse (he said that …; she said, " ….") are eliminated. The character's speech is directly inserted into the author's expression. This creates a "paratactic" connection between the two utterances: a direct contiguity without any marked subordination, as if "both the author and the character were speaking at the same time."lxiii "The boundaries of reported speech become extremely weak," as if the two activities of speech generation were "breaking into each other."lxiv Each retains its own evaluative accents to some extent. These "collide and interfere."lxv "Two intonations, two points of view, two speech acts converge and clash."lxvi The result is a single "varidirectional"lxvii stream of language which envelops within itself a social "interorientation."lxviii This "merging of differently oriented speech acts is quasi-direct discourse": "speech interference."lxix Expressive social noise.
