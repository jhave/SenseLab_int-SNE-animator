The artist delicately suggests that success as an artist has its challenges. She has made it. She has made it to the pinnacle. She has won. She is in the Venice Biennale. Few art places are as identified and categorized and overlaid with meanings and versionings as the Venice Biennale. It's like an Olympics of arts. Can you imagine? Putting art in national pavilions. Overlaying national identities onto art practice, in this postcolonial day and age? Making the individual artist inhabit that overlay? Housing that individual inhabiting in a pavilion flying a home nation flag? All very good for the artist's official biography, to be sure. Even though a good deal of lumping is afoot. For example: what is non-citizen Simryn Kaur Gill Ajaib Singh Gill's "home nation"? Still, good for the official biography, and good for the nation-building history of art of which this exhibition will enter the books as a recorded episode. But what about it is good for the living art â€“ not to mention the art of living?
