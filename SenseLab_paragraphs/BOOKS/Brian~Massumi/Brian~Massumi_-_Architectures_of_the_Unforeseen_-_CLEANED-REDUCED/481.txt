Art for the artist is a procedure for living, for staying afloat to the fullest of her potential. Yet she professes to be extremely uncomfortable with any biographical framing of her artistic journeying. Is there life beyond biography? Wrong question. Again. Ask instead: is one's own biography liveable? Not with the constraints that come with being so identified. A case in point is the artist's complicated relation to her own official name.
