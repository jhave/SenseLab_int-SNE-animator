The internet-led back-stepping of the cultural act into pure sociality has been decried as the death of culture. The internet has also been lamented for underminig the objectivity of public sphere expression. It has been demonized for undermining the implementation of responsible social positioning in speech and tainting the seriousness of the ideational content of expression (just a minute, haven't we heard that before? Isn't that Vološinov's version of intellectual property? Except … who did he get it from?). The internet's malevolent effects on the "inner personality," particulary in its tender childhood shoots, have been voluminously fretted over (not least of all, on the internet).
