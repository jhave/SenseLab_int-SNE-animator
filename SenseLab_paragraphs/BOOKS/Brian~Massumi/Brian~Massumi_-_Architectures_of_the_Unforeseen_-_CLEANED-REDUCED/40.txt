The word “extraction” is important. You can only get something particular out of the ongoing transformation by wrenching it from its immanence in that process. The topological figure is in principle endless. It could just as well go on forever, generating an infinite number of forms. To end up with any particular form, you have to extract it from that ongoing. You have to stop the process. A classical geometric form is a topological station.
