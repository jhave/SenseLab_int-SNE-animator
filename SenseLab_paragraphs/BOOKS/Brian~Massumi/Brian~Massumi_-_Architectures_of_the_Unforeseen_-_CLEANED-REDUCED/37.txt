Rather than treating discrete forms composed of isolatable elements, topology deals with continuums. Topology will take a traditional geometric form, say a sphere, and torture it. It will twist it and turn it, stretch it and compress it, until it turns into something else entirely, say a horse-shoe. The topological figure itself is neither the sphere nor the horse-shoe. It is the continuity between them. The continuity is of a transformation. The transformation is a deformation. The Euclidean form you end up with is secondary to the deformation. It arises as an effect of a transformational process. Topology concerns continuities of deformation more directly than static form.
