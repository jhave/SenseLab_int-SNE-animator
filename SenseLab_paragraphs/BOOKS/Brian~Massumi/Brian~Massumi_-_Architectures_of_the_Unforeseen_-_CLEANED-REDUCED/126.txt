It is noteworthy that the optical effect built into the Korean Presbyterian Church triggers a symbolic association of just the kind against which Lynn so carefully defends his design process as a whole. The symbolism takes the form of an optical effect. Like all optical effects, its appearance stands out from the conditions of its appearing. Its pops out from its production, to occupy a separate plane from it. Here, it pops out of the singular-generic into a genre; from operativity into symbolism; from experimentation into belief; from the generativity of process into perception experienced soulfully; from open field conditions mobilizing the never-before-seen of the virtual to subjective reception confirming the already-felt. The ceiling fins, from this poiont of view, are a kind of gear-shift mechanism between vastly different compositional planes.
