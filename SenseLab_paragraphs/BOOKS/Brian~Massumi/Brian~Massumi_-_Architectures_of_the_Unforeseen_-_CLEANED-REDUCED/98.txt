But isn’t this true of any design process, topological or otherwise? If design were architecturally pre-defined, how could designing change architecture? How would architecture itself ever evolve? It would be trapped in the vicious circle of its definition preceding itself, only ever to become what it already is. The very fact that architecture has a history necessitates the paradoxical view of the design process as a real becoming integratively outside the history it changingly enters. What is new and different about animate architecture is neither its virtuality –its self-immanent proto-reality – nor its co-variational emergence. What’s new is that it admits to and nurtures them. That it admits to being just emergent (rather than always already defined). That it brings out its coming out. And revels in it, taking cheer in its own creative incompletion. Never does Lynn claim to be the end-all.
