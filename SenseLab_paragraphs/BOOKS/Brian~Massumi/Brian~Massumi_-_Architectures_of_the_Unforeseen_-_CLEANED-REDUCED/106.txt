If Lynnâ€™s architecture were miscontrued as taking for its guiding principle a style or formal aesthetic, it would doubtless be characterized as biomorphic. It is in fact a common perception that Lynn sets out to produce architectural forms conveying biological metaphors. His designs do seem to burgeon or exfoliate, amoebate or grub. But it is entirely missing the point if this metaphoricity is taken to characterize the design process. That the process does not exclude metaphorical associations is attested to by the regularity with which they are voiced by viewers. But if the process gives rise to metaphor it is by non-metaphorical means, as a by-product of its relational operation. Any metaphorical associations that may set in between a topological design and a preexisting biological form are produced resemblances, in the sense discussed earlier: derivatives. When a metaphorical reading begins, it is a sure sign that the process has stopped. It has been taken up by or flipped over into an entirely different process, one based on formal assimilation rather than formative differentiation.
