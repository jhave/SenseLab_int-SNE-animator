Hollowed out by their own shape, naughts have none of the charm or personality of the fully collectable. Having no meaningful origin, their happening to be in the particular place they are found betokens no attachment. They are traces, but of nothing of note. The artist does not collect them in the key of melancholy and nostalgia. They are kept, but not cherished. They are not for display. They are not for decoration. They are not an indulgence in a trash aesthetic. They are there, simply to be kept. And counted. Counting: the most minimal activity to which a collection lends itself.
