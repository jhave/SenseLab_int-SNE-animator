Mindful not to be on about, the artist often proceeds by indirection. For example, she is going to Venice, so goes to the outback. She is drawn to the mines without yet knowing how they might possibly relate to what she will end up doing as the Malaysian Australian representative to the Biennale. She returns to Sydney, and her collections of small epiphanies, with more to add. She takes her curator on her alternative tour of Port Dickson. Still more additions. The count rises. The ground also rises. This latest reencounter with Malaysia, as always, triggers things from the past, including from the family and social histories she worked so hard to unrule herself of. She is drawn to a kind of Hindu bronze ritual vessel, and collects that drawing-in. She is drawn into a certain style of chair she associates with her grandfather, and collects a number of them together. She remembers the small epiphany from her childhood of realizing that after they fell the leaves of a certain local tree, called the sea jumbu, dappled themselves with abstract patterns that she felt  anticipated modern art. On an earlier trip, she ventured round the town nosing about, seeking, talking to people, and finally found a still-living specimen, halfway down a cliff to the sea. Talk about looking over a cliff.
