A gash in emptiness. From a plane's eye view, it is hard not to see it that way even though one knows better. The land below, we know, is vibrating with history. It is one of the oldest geological formations on earth. It is also country to the world's oldest continuous culture. It is alive with traces of passage, as animated with care and rejuvenated with ritual as it is worn by the elements. This is not to say that it is without scars, that history does not also burden it. The gash in the emptiness that it is hard not to see as both the culmination of a conquest and a new iteration of it.
