In chapter 2 on Lozano-Hemmer, the problem of the relationship-specific in contradistinction with the site-specific raises the follow-up problem of the status of the historical references, cultural codes, and social conventions activated and played upon in the work. This inevitably raises the issue of language, and of mediation in general. Lozano-Hemmer's work is predicated on the bodily involvement of participants, in an immediacy of shared experience. And yet they speak. Can the language be construed, not as a mediating structure, but as a directly bodily involvement? Is participation, then, an immediation, even in the use of language? If the specificity of what happens is in the relationship, then the event of participation is not confined to the individual body any more than it is confined to the locality. Does that mean that it involves a collective body? What sort of thing is that? Is there a transindividual level of language corresponding to it? If we say yes to these questions, how does that change what we understand by culture? By the social? Is there difference between them? If so, what is it? And what is their relation to the political? Thorny, forky problems all. In the case of Lozano-Hemmer, it seemed more feasible to attack these problems through an intensive engagement with a limited number of works from a particular period, rather than following the full length of the processual arc of the work, as was attempted for Lynn. The chapter, as a result, does not reflect the full breadth of Lozano-Hemmer's prolific and ever-ramifying creative production.
