The literary use of quasi-direct discourse is one thing. What worries Vološinov is "the social tendency it expresses."lxx He saw quasi-direct discourse gaining ground outside literature, around the edges of respectable public discourse. It was clear to him that "quasi-direct discourse lines on the main road of development of modern European languages, that it signalizes some crucial turning point in the social vicissitudes of utterance."lxxi Without giving specific examples, he laments that in the rising tide of quasi-direct discourse "typifying and individualizing coatings of the utterance" become "intensely" differentiated, hypertrophied to the point that they undermine the "responsible social position implemented in it."lxxii In other words, the extreme of typicality and the extreme of individuality converge and clash. Not unlike in gossip. The two extremes combine, without mediation, in a single interorientation, a varidirectional stream of de-positioned – deterritorialized – language from which "serious ideational consideration" has been been quasied out.lxxiii What is left is the "expression of an adventitous, subjective state" of indeterminate personhood, as intensely typical as it is  hypertrophically individual. First person? Third? … Fourth it is. Folding together. Topological personhood?
