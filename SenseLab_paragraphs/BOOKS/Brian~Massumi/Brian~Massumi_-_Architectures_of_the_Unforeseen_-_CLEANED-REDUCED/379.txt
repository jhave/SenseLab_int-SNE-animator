Volo≈°inov's calls the in-forming of an act of expression by the open field of culturability and sociability, in their overlap and interfusion, "impletion."lii Etymologically, that means infolding. "Personality, from the standpoint of its inner, subjective content," he writes, " is a theme of language." Personality is a theme of language. The implications are enormous. It makes it nonsensical to speak of speech as being subjectively owned in any fundamental way, as if there were an isolable private person lurking "behind" the act. There is no behind, only in-folding in folding out again, in a to-and-fro of the open field folding in on itself. What we call our personal thinking is anything but. It is the thinking of the open field, as passes languageward hrough a given point in a simultaneous two-way movement. Our thinking is integrally in-formed by the thinking-feeling of the open field. Our thinking rides astraddle scales and dimensions of experience, telescoped into processual proximity in the material quality of thought-signs. Our thinking is not effectively separable from this bare activity. It is not effectively ownable. It ultimately belongs not to me, but to the process expressing itself in and through my acts. My personality is the unique way the open field of thinking-feeling impletes my acts of expression: the way the field inflects and modulates itself through the following one upon the other of the ongoing series of acts I claim as  my own and experience as manifesting what it's like to be me. "The inner personality is generated along with language."liii It is the way the open field of relations channels through the ambulent locus for the production of acts of expression whose proximate neighborhood is my individual body. My personality is my theme.
