The manyness of the mini-fields in a particle cloud means that the chaotic effect of order out of resonance can be achieved with just one ambient gradient field, modelling for example the earth’s gravitational influence. The particles’ rigidity factor can be relaxed to give them extra chaotic bounce. The architect can take the resulting anexact cloud shape and extract a useable Euclidean form from it. This can be done as simply as by taking a freeze-frame and cleaning it up. Another procedure uses an animation “sweep” technique to produce a “phase portrait” of selected particles’ trajectories. This consists in capturing images of a particle at regular intervals over the course of its movement, superimposing the stills on the same frame, then repeating the procedure for several particles, and finally superimposing the portraits.xxii The resulting form is useful because, by the very nature of the process of its patterning, it automatically embodies gravitational effects. The Euclidean translation of the anexact chaotic form is pre-engineered for gravity. It is fit, for example, to be an exit ramp. It must be emphasized that the usefulness comes out toward the end. The process leading up to a functional result is not itself functionally determined. It is intensively determined, through resonance and re-run. It is proto-functional in the same way that it is proto-formal.xxiii The functionality emerges in the same movement as the form itself, both as expressions of a relational process resembling nothing other than its own process, its own iterative intensity. FORM AND FUNCTION FOLLOW INTENSITY (not as catchy, but still not bad for a motto).
