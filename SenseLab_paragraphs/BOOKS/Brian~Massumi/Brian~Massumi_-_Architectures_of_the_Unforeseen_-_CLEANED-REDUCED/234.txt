The word “fusion” requires another vocabulary check. Digital media are commonly spoken of in terms of “connectivity.” Michotte says that the tending body is without specific organization and without connection. At each step it reconnects differently with the world. With each connection, it modifies its posture toward the world, inflecting its tendings, adding memories and impendings, modulating its capacities and desires, stretching itself across a different range of dimensions, remixing in live performance a varying selection of the available registers of life activity. Moment to moment, it reorganizes its living in the world. It becomes through its reorganizations. The reality of the body, at any given moment, includes the potential to make a next connection differently. This potential carries across the connections, in-forming each in its incipiency with the tendency a next step is coming to express. The body is without any specifiable order of connections, because at each one it is amoebically astraddle any number of them, extending through into its own potential.
