Vološinov goes on to say that there is a reservoir of past communications into which each message dissipates. A message never disappears, especially in this digital age where everything can be recorded and automatically archived. A speech act doesn’t disappear; it relaxes into the archive. Every message ever produced subsides in the potential for reported speech – the potential to be taken up again and reactualized in a third party report of what was said. In its widest sense, the Archive is the pure potential for speech. It is the abstract surface of rhythm and sound relaxing to the far-real and contracting noisily toward speech. An actual digital archive doubles the abstract surface of the Archive in far-real sense, contracting selected crestings on the sea of reportable speech into its own element – in this case digitality, the dominant manner of archival appearing in our age.
