The implications of this are wider than generally recognized. The means of creative production cannot be relegated to the status of outside elements belonging to biographical or historical “context.” If the means of production enter into the definition of the product, they are nothing less than factors of creation. The “instruments” of an artistic discipline are internal variables of the creative process. They are generative factors, intrinsic to artistic form: formal co-conceivers. Face it: no achieved architectural design has ever leapt fully-formed from the Chronos-skull of a gloriously autonomous creative “author.” An architectural idea meanders through many a channel of technique, each of which inflects it, before pouring into the concrete ocean of the surrounding city. The most static of built forms embodies a fluvial movement: of its own making. In progress, a building’s only context is its own formative process – to which nothing with which it streams is extrinsic. Only after it is constructed does a design idea stand still enough to have an external context. Before, it has only growth factors.
