The elements in the open fields lying on either side of the walls are so various, the complexity of their interactions so complex, that each field taken in its own right, and both together, in their folding into and out of each other, exceed the visible. The concrete architectural surface lends its own visibility to this excess over the seen. The concrete surface stands in vision for the dynamic form of this fielding and folding. Its static form is the visible instantiation of the dynamic form of architecture, of its animate form. The concrete architectural surface expresses the multi-dimensioned, many-fielded, formative forces of architectural body-events in three dimensions â€“ just as the particle clouds, blobs, and splines of Lynn's design process expressed the many-dimensioned formative forces of the design process on his 2D computer screen.
