Its stations, the classical Euclidean forms that can be extracted from it, do belong to a type or class of geometric entities. The sphere is a discrete member of the set of spheres: a particular instance of its ideal class. The topological transformation doesnâ€™t subsume its formal expressions under an ideal type. Rather, it effects them. In crowds. It proliferates them. Classical Euclidean forms are included in the overall topological figure in the sense that they populate its process. Their mutual inclusion is their population of the same generative process. That transformation has no invariant features. Having no shape that is proper to it, it has no figural properties. It has no properties except the plastic parameters its own continuous inclusion (of the de-form).iii
