Now imagine that all the hands are covered by a thin membrane. They are holding up a diaphanous tarp. When they wave, the membrane's surface ripples, deforming into the rolling of the wave. The dynamic form of the event would be the same. But now a concrete surface – the tarp – is doubling the abstract surface that doubles the collectivity of the wave's formative elements. Doubling doubled again. The concrete surface shares the same dynamic form as the abstract-surface wave, which it makes actually visible. The membrane doubles the abstract form of the stadium wave with a sensible form whose rhythm and patterning is identical to it. Even though this dynamic form is shared, there is still a minimal difference that makes all the difference: between the nonsensuous and the sensuous. This is the difference between intensive matter (which is nonlocalizable, as an all-over effect) and extensive matter (which, concretely extending over an area, has physical location). The affective matter of the wave is redoubled by visible matter. The nonphysicality of the body-event concretes. The touchable membrane covers the event, contributing its own physicality to it. That physical resurfacing interposes itself between the formative factors of the wave – the crowd of stadium fans – and the home fans populating the wider context of the media environment.
