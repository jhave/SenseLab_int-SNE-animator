It is important to note that the limit is not a formal feature. It is an event â€“ an accident befalling the transformation. Like the figure itself, the limit is durational. Meaning: it is also shapeless, scaleless, and positionless. It cuts the topological figure off in a vague space of its own process. Like an atom of continuity floating in the void. Where is it in that space? Once again, it is not in any one of the forms expressing it. It passes through them all. Between any two classifiable forms populating it are stretches of formal mutation. But the topological figure as such is not in those stretches either. If you stop the process in-between, you get a mutant Euclidean form. But even in the mutant, the topological transformation, in its process, its continuity, has already passed on. It is in no particular station or transition. It is irretrieveably recessive. Wherever it is seen to be, it has already passed. It is formally elusive. Not only logical or abstract, but always effectively elsewhere: virtual. Its transitional reality is a virtual reality.
