This "priming," or subthreshold modulation, is very much a part of “normal” perception as well. Blindsight only provides a dramatic illustration of a process native to perception. There is a temporal blindsight at the heart of vision. The “attentional gap” is a hiatus of a fraction of a second after the cresting of a conscious awareness and the rising of the next to replace it. Micro-events occurring in the gap do not register consciously, but as in blindsight they orient what comes. For example, a written word shown so quickly that it falls into the attentional gap will not be remembered. But its affective tenor will register (whether its valence was “positive” or “negative”).xiii This orienting effect also occurs with events on the periphery of attention, which might have registered consciously had the focus been there. The modulation even co-occurs with conscious awareness, without the effect itself being perceived. In these cases, the orienting is like a spin affecting an otherwise conscious activity unawares. Laboratory subjects exposed to a sentence containing the words “Florida” and “bingo,” for example, experienced word-induced premature aging: they walked away from the laboratory building at a rate fifteen percent slower than controls.xiv Affective toning/action inflection: “emotional-volitional.” The emotional-volitional moment of language occurs in immediate, fusional proximity with extra-linguistic dimensions of experience that “blindly,” bodily, inhabit its performance, and to which it owes an effective orientation. It is these dimensions which give language its immediate force for existence: a direct life-altering power.
