Material qualities fast-forward themselves into what comes. As operative thought-signs, they inhabit the phenomenal gaps, in precipitate nextness. The life of what Michotte calls the “phenomenal body” is the issue of nonphenomenal gap events: virtual events occurring in the attentional off-beat of experience, appearing only in and as the modulatory effects they precipate. These gap-events are no less real, no less bodily, no less operative, no less tendentially determining, for passing actually unfelt. The scalar plasticity of the proteiform “kinesthetic amoeba” Michotte describes marks the phenomenal limit of the life of the body. The thought-signs, the material qualities, from which the kinesthetic amoeba’s next stretch pluripotently emerges belong to a nonconscious dimension of already-not-quite experience stirring. Experience never quite goes there. It is always already issuing from there, into itself, across a constitutive gap. The virtual events occurring in the gap are not only infraindividual, they are infraphenomenal: effectively unappearing; appearing only in effect. The infraphenomenal is the constitutive limit of life where body is event: where the life of the body is integrally absorbed in the already virtually occurring of what is coming to pass.
