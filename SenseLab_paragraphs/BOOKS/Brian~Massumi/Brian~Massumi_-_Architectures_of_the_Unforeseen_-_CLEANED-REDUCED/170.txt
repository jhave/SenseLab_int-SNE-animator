Focusing on the problem of the surface brings with it enormous advantages for a topological architecture. A surface can undergo topological transformations to yield proto-forms that can be scaled and adapted to feed forward into any genre of architectural construction, house, office, station, tower, kiosk even. Lynn's projects extend to all of these genres â€“ and beyond (even so far beyond as extraterrestrial habitatslxvi). His design practice from the turn of the millenium encompasses interiors, art installations, household objects like tea sets and cutlery, furniture, boats, and high-performance vehicles. This breadth of design activity is not an eclecticism. It is not a leaping hither and thither at whim. The diversity inheres. All of these divergent lines of development unfold from the same source, which is not an origin so much as a generative matrix for the continuous production of variation.
