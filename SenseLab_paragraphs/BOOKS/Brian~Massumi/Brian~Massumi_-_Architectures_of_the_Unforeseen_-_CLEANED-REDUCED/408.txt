Thought is not necessarily connected with a brain. It appears in the work of bees, of crystals, and throughout the purely physical world; and one can no more deny that it is really there, than that the colors, the shapes, etc., of objects are really there. … Not only is thought in the organic world, but it develops there. . Admitting that connected Signs must have a Quasi-mind, it may further be declared that there can be no isolated sign. … Accordingly, it is not merely a fact of human Psychology, but a necessity of Logic, that every logical evolution of thought should be dialogic. You may say that all this is loose talk; and I admit that, as it stands, it has a large infusion of arbitrariness. It might be filled out with argument so as to remove the greater part of this fault; but in the first place, such an expansion would require a volume – and an uninviting one; … so that, should it be incorrect, the utmost certain effect will be a danger that our system may not represent every variety of non-human thought.lxxx
