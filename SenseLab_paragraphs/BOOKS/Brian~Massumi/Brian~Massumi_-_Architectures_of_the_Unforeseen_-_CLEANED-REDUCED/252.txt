A further major consequence: this forbids any distinction between “raw” experience and enculturated experience – as it does any empirical distinction between the physical or physiological on the one side and the cognitive on the other. Cultural factors associated with “higher” cognitive operations are already materially entering into effect in the attentional gap, in whose inaugural stir they are as already-abstract as they are still-bodily. The feeling-motions of the material quality of coming experience agitate in a zone of indistinction between body and thought.
