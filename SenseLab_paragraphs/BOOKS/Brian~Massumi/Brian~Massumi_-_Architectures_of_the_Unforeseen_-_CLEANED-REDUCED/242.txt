There is a misunderstanding of words similar to the misunderstanding of the body as an object. It is the belief that words are inert, general reflections of “psychic experiences,” cognitions or cogitations, which they would represent in the way a visual image is said (equally erroneously) to represent an object or a body. Bakhtin, however, is clear: it is not the “linguistic form” or its reflective content that “enters the aesthetic object” (which in Bakhtin’s account is in point of fact always a performance). Rather, what enters the artistic work is the singular “emotional-volitional moment corresponding to that form”: the eventful reality of the embodiable tendencies, with their attendant affectabilities, that the words present (integrally reactivate and selectively trigger).
