“The transitions between positions [of the light arrays] were as important as the positions themselves,” Lozano-Hemmer said.xxxiv It is in the transitions – accordioned into the gaps between stimulus and response – that relation is really, nonconsciously felt. What the project presented overall was less a series of discrete patterns than “a coordinated state of mutation.” Collective mutation, minus the actual weight of collectivity: that practiced gravity of being functionally and interpretably limited to a particular cultural group. Between positions, lightness. Beam and motion. Tending-to planely rendered in intersecting vectors of light saddling each other, rays re-arraying. Relation reduced to its visible minimum of luminous appearing. The shadow of a shadow of culturability illumined. Penumbra of relational light. The human environment beamingly dematerialized through the relay from computers around the globe to searchlight on site to spectators on site and around the globe, accordioning into the gaps between positions. The distributed immediacy of that event could not fail to spark thought-signed feelings-motions in the individual bodies factoring into the collective becoming event-body on the continuum of community and alien memory. Felt movements that were certainly an incipiency, no doubt a tending, or many. Together. Locally-globally unified in the aesthetic effect of a shared transitioning of positions.
