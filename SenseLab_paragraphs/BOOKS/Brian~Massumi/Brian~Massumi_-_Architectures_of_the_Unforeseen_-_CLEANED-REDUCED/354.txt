"Amodal Suspension" suggests that instead of language being one with culture, it is of-a-many with it: integrally imbricated with it, yet not equatable to it. More than one domain overlaps in the cresting of language. There must be a distinction, for example, between the cultural act and the social act, each peaking from their respective domains and -abilities. There must be a field of sociability that overlaps with that of culturability, but it is not reducible to it. If so, each expression in language contracts both fields. But the distinction between them is not erased by this mutual inclusion in the event. Sociability and culturability are like two co-composing tonal systems. They are both in on each act, but only one gives the act its dominant tonality. In "Displaced Emperors," "Re:Positioning Fear," and "Vectorial Elevation," the emphasis was on contracting into the event political and historical references and codings, across many a level and in many a register, from the angle of their infra-stirring, astraddle the translocal movements that intersect in the event's taking place in such a way as to also stir alien memories of the far-realest kind into the meiotic soup. Culturability was the dominant tonality: its element. In "Amodal Suspension," by contrast, the emphasis is on contracting reported speech and the anonymous murmur into the event and its archive. Here, sociability is the dominant tonality: the element. Political and historical references and codings are suspended, in the hijacking of communication. Culture hangs in the air, unrequited. Sociability, however, persists. In fact, it comes out for itself. It flashes forth to express its native force.
