When Lynn launched the rallying cry of “folding in architecture” he was not referring to a new style. “It is important to maintain a logic rather than a style of curvilinearity.”xxix Although topological design technique facilitates curvilinear form, there is no necessity to its dominating any final architectural rendering. As Bernard Cache has also vigorously argued, there is no intrinsic connection between topological design technique and any particular look.xxx “Folding in architecture” connotes not a style but a dynamic “logic,” a quality of process: “the formal affinities of [topological design projects] result from their pliancy and ability to deform in response to particular contingencies.”xxxi The folding “in” architecture is a contingent “folding-in” of the archtitectural outside.
