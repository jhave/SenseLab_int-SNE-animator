In Lynn's practice, techniques proliferate for the emergence of proto-architectural elements providing the taking-off points for architectural body-events which include as one of their dimensions affordances for the physical body. These result in nonstandard fusions between architectural elements and types on the one hand (the Room Vehicle, 2012, being the epitome),lxxxvi and architectural surface and perceptual surface on the other. For example, the technique of finning returns in the X-Ray Wall shelving system that was Lynn's contribution to the 2000 Venice Biennale of Architecture. Here, the fin assemblage combines "varying modules" in a way that "integrates structure, envelope and domestic landscape into a single system" composing an architectural-surface overgesture. "A single surface is reponsible for structure, lighting, aperture, and spatial inflection" as "the striations of the CNC tool path [become] modulations of light, reflection, and translucency."lxxxvii Many new geometric techniques are added to the menagerie of proto-forms, already populated by particle clouds, splines, and blobs, to multiply the potentials. "Blebs," for example, are curvilenear surfaces composed of networks of curves which sometimes whorl around each other to form pockets constituting proto-interiors.lxxxviii
