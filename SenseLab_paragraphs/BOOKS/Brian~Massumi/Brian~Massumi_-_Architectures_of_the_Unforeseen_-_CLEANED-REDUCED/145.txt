The body is duplex: that which folds itself double. The fusional multiplicity of the collective effect stands out from and doubles the individual bodies forming it, without physically separating itself from them. Rather, it abstracts itself out of the in-between of them, into its own dynamic form. It couches itself in its own intensive matter, which overlaps with the physical activity of its elemental, fleshly bodies, while distinguishing itself from their elemental forms. The becoming-body of the wave brings the multiplicity of flesh-and-blood bodies to a singularly eventful, affective expression, on and as its own register of the real: intensive, expressive body-event.
