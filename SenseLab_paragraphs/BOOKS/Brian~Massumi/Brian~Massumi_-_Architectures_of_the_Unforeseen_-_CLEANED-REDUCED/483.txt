But is not every biography overkill, in one way or another? Even when one is free to self-label? It still loops into redundancy: I-me-mine. Even a biography rightfully inscribed in its community of identity is redundant: I-you-we. Who "we"? Who are you lumping in with that I of yours? Do I-and-I have to mirror you? Are we under obligation to mirror the emptiness of your excavation of your biography in our expanse? Are you to we as a "mine" is to the open land of community?
