Felt without actually being felt, thoughtfully passing unawares; directly lived but registering only on the level of its effect; just-beginning what is going on, as yet undone; blinked forward into life’s nextness; materially operative, unappearing … What it all adds up to is a real but abstract bodily experience. Material quality is where thought and body really come together, at the just-stirring again of the “animal body” tending as yet abstractly toward a next-inflected amoebic stretch.xxii
