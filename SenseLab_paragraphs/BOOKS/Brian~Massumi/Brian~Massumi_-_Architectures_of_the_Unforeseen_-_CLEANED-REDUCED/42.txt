The topological figure may be thought of as the form of all the forms that express it. But it is not a “form” in the same capacity as they. They are forms of expression. It is a form of transition. If the topological figure is not in any of the particular forms that stand out from it, then it can only be in-between them. It has only transitional reality. It is a space of pure transition.
