The wave is a singular effect arising from no one cause. Every effect has some kind of cause. But some causes are more-than-one. These cannot be localized, in one subject or at particular point in space. The cause of the stadium wave is by nature distributed, akimbo the in-between. It is simultaneously here and there in the originating group, in the intervals between those existing bodies, all at once. The existing bodies are not acting as separate bodies. They are acting as correlated wave-formation factors. Their vitality enters selectively and partially into the wave. The participating individuals do not enter into the wave as who they are. Their identity is not important to the wave or what it expresses. In a full-stadium wave, even the participants' identity as fans of their particular team is suspended, as fans of both camps may act in concert to pump up the atmosphere. What the participants are is how they are, together, for the wave-making. All that is relevant is their concertation as formative factors for this event. They do not figure in the event as individual persons or identified bodies. They figure purely operatively, from the precise angle of their wave-making activity. They only figure in this capacity, in pro-wave efficacity. They are proto-wavers, in much the same way blobs are proto-architectural elements. They are elemental forces for formation, correlating into a composite movement. Each individual's gesture movingly fuses into the dynamic form of the wave. One wave, many bodies. From many subgestures, an integral overgesture. A singular "fusional mulitplicity."xlix
