The cultural domain is an unmediated “participation” of heterogeneous levels of organization and registers of activity in each other, collectively mutually including, in a proximately neighborly way. It is a region of relation. The relation in-forming the domain is autonomous in the sense that the edgy in-each-other of the heterogeneities composing it abstractly doubles the singularity of the coming event with its own self-inflecting potential – with its as-yet unfully determined -ability extending, fold upon fold after fold, across the spectrum to the alien unknown. Once again, given the splay of levels and registers that fuse into continuity with each other in the dynamic unity of the cultural act with which the cultural domain is co-emergent – plagues now and then, invasions, memories of the past, memories of a future, past suffering, future fears, the strangeness of unknown potential, the comfort of community, the constructed local environment, the global network, the online chat, language and gesture – only one adjective can embrace the -ability of all of this to come effectively together: cultural. Culture -ability. Culturability: an autonomous participation of levels and registers in each other, toward the taking-place of a coming cultural act, already almost-there on the abstract event-plane of its own incipiency.
