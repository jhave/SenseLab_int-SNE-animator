It is a working assumption of the architectural practice of Greg Lynn that the instruments of design are not incidental to the creative process. They are not neutral tools through which a conceptual program passes on its way to realization. “Throughout the history of architecture, descriptive techniques have impacted the way in which architectural design and construction have been practiced.”i The tools contribute to the definition of the trade, partially determining its outcomes. Their practical action cannot be entirely subtracted from the final design form.
