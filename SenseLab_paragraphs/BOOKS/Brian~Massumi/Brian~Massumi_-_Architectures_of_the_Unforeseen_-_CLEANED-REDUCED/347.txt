Reported speech, Vološinov reminds us, bears testimony to an “active relation of one message to another.” That active relation is the condition of emergence or real potential of communication: “words reacting upon words,”xliv to new but analogous effect, in a continuity of variation. At rest in an archive, that active relation becalms itself. Words already-said relax back toward the collective sea of communication, subsiding into Lozano-Hemmer’s social soup, rejoining what Maurice Blanchot called the anonymous "murmur” that is both the Archival ground of language and its outside limit.xlv Actually archived words are in communicational reserve, poised for reactivation. Upon reactivation, they leave their backwater of repose to reenter the active stream of language. They come back in citation, undertoning and inflecting the cresting of a new event of language. Words regained, reacting again upon words. Language ebbing and flowing, relaxing into stagnant eddies and contracting again into the wave-crest.
