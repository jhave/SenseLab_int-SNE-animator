Earlier, Lynn’s design process was qualified as “adventitious,” as said of buds. This does assert an identity of sorts. But it is not fundamentally between buds and buildings. It is less that buildings are budlike than that the processes from which both buds and buildings grow proceed adventitiously, in like manner. In other words, Lynn’s architecture is “animate” in the sense that it marshals for architectural design some of the “same” relational growth processes – those native to generative fields plied by flexible and adaptable systems of integrating differences – as have led to the proliferations of life. It runs with the same exuberance of variation and evolutionary abandon as is everywhere apparent in nature outside the studio. The concept of identity at issue here does not hinge on visible resemblance. It is not a formal identity. It signifies nothing. It runs (away with itself). It is an asignifying operative identity. Operative, or processual, identity has its own logic. It is not subject to the formal likeness-driven classificatory thinking underwriting metaphor. By the same token, it is free of imitation. The concern is not to imitate biological form, any more than it is to produce metaphors of it. "Building are not organisms but merely provisional structures that are already multiplicitous."xl The concern is for the de-form, as it happens: the multiple, the singular, and the generic, in differential continuity and continuous differentiation. Imageless, ongoing, iteratively divergent and divergently emergent.xli
