There is an “autonomous participation” or “participative autonomy” occurring at an intersection of levels: of thought and feeling, of words and actions, of actions and perceptions, of mutations and organizations. This intersection of levels composes the domain of culture. Except that it is not a domain, in any sense of the term as a spatial whole. The domain of culture has no inner territory. It is composed entirely of the boundary lines of the levels intersecting. At the intersection, the levels edge over and into each other, forming a saddle. The lines composing the domain of culture are not outlines separating off an interior space. They are saddles, thresholds, over which relays may occur. Lines that intersect and overlap compose a plane. A surface. A domain of culture is a surface drawn of different levels and registers of life saddling each other, delineating potential relays, from thought to feeling and back again, or between words and actions, actions and perceptions, mutations and organizations, all overlapping in the material quality of bare activity.
