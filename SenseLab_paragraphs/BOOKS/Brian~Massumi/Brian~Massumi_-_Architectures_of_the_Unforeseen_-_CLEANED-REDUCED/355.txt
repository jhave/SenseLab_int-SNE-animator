Culturabilty and sociabilty are overlapping fields. Both are ultimately open fields, meaning that they are unbounded. This makes it nonsensical to try to demarcate a boundary between them. How then can they distinguished, in their indefinite overlap? The distinction cannot be one of content type, because what defines them as -abilities afield is precisely their self-abstraction from content, which takes place in the very same movement by which their acts performatively peak into a clearly appearing dynamic unity of expression. The dynamic form of that expression fusionally folds the fields of emergence into the sensuous form of the content's cresting. In and of themselves, these fields are the potential for content. In and of themselves, they have only virtual content. The only way to adequately distinguish them is, rather than by trying to establish boundaries between them, to define their effective limits.
