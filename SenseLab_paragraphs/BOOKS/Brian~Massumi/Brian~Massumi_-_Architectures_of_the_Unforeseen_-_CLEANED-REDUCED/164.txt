Lars Spuybroek generates his own modes of practice that are also explicitly topological, in alliance with proto-forces of the architectural outside. Unlike Lynn, Spuybroek retains a central concern for the perceiving body in its transductive relation to its environment (as witnessed in such projects as Vision Machine and his later theoretical work on sympathylxiii). Spuybroek's transductive process of architectural design continues the continuing problem in an original way: by folding the proto-architectural expressions of digital form-generating into and out of materials-based analogue computing. Spuybroek's architectural practice extends topological design techniques into the analogue world it supposedly left behind. Although Lynn's and Spuybroek's practices are very different from one another, their processes are fellow-travellers in the sense that they both pursue, each in its own way, the transductive deployment of topological thought. Both constitute abstract expressionisms.lxiv
