This is taking “medium” in a different sense than usual. Understood in this way, a medium is not a technological or material support for the transmission of a content. The technological and material supports for relational architecture are architecture, writing, the body, the digital, the electronic, light, movement, silicon. In Lozano-Hemmer’s work, by conscious design, they do not self-transmit or transmit something else that might come across as a specific message. What they do is come together. Not only dynamically, but materially qualitatively. When they come together, something happens: a tendential fusion relationally giving next-ability. This effect is not the sovereign province of any its contributing levels taken singly. It happens between them, differentially, in and as their gap-active coming-together. A taking-place in media res.
