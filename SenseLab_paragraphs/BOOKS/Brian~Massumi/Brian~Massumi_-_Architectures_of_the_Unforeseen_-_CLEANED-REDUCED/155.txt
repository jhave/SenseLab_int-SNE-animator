This is another way of saying that architecture must be defined in the first instance in terms of proto-architectural forces, from which architectural forms proper are processual precipates: derivatives. When a built form precipitates from the design process, dropping into the open fields of life, the "derivative" reactivates, becoming a derived force. Its now concrete surfaces become transductive membranes actively modulating architectural body-events of inhabitation. In a way, the "continuing problem" discussed earlier, the question of how the design process feeds its fielding of its elemental formative forces forward into the built environment, is a non-issue. The process cannot but restart. At the first laying of a brick or application of drywall, it's up and re-running, enjoying an active afterlife. Across the interval of construction, it has transduced from a proto-architectural design-event to an architectural event proper.
