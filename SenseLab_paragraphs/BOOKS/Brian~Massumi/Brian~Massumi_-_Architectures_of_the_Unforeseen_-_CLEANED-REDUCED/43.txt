This is a decidedly odd space. Outside any of its stations (in which it is outside of its processual self) it has only twists and turns and stretches and compressions. That is to say, it has no shape of its own. It is defined by vectors of transformation rather than figural components. In addition, it is unbounded. It can go on endlessly, in any of the three dimensions of Euclidean space and the two dimensions of time (being reversible). Further, it can be zoomed up or down. It has no inherent scale. Being endless, shapeless, unbounded, and scaleless, it cannot be said to have position. Being endless, shapeless, unbounded, scaleless, and positionless, it cannot constitute a univalent type. It includes any number of geometric types. It mutually includes them: it is hypertypological.
