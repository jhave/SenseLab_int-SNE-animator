Lynnâ€™s gesture of building something like what he is building, and building for the people who use the building, his modestly allowing a symbolic becoming-Christian of his own steadfastly ungodly design practice, is a manifestation of the processual generosity alluded to earlier. It would be pure arrogance (not unheard-of among architects) to build in defiance of the clients' perceptions of their own needs. At the same time, this processual generosity in some ways amounts to a processual abdication. The generative process gear-shifts out of itself onto another plane, of a very different nature, where it culminates in a re-production of the already-felt rather continuing on its generative way. In the optical effect of the ceiling fins, the architectural process in-folded right out of itself. Emergence peaks out of itself, perceptually. This is one way of dealing with the continuing problem. But to judge by the subsequent evolution of his work, Lynn felt that this way, if generalized in his work, would lead to an impasse.
