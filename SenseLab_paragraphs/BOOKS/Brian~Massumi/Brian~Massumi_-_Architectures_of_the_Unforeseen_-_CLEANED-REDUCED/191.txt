Architecture, it was argued earlier, is less a discipline than an open field of practice formatively infolding foreign practices belonging to any number of domains. Understood in this way, the processual "generosity" of what was characterized earlier as "affirmative" architecture consists in creatively allying itself with other processes, and loving it â€“ geometry, engineering, interior design,  and urbanism being the obvious candidates, but also including the dreaded client preference. Lynn's practices of alliance are particularly promiscuous, and increasingly so, spanning Hollywood animation (from which he imported the topological software tools that launched his process on its deformational way), installation art, graphic design, aerodynamics, sail design, and high-performance vehicle design.
