This “thirdness” (to speak like C.S. Peirce) is the basic articulation of the signal. But three’s a crowd. Each of the variations punctuated by the off-state is multiple, consisting of a population of intensities. This complexity translates as a pulsation. The result is very different from the strobe effect ordinarily used to transmit code visually. Most if not all of the messages will consist of more than two words. Coming irregularly in the midst of a series of changes in intensity, the moment of near darkness will meld into the continuing pulsing, its threeness into the multiplicity it parses. Rather than an off-state that is the opposite of an on-state, it will come across as the low note on the same scale (brightness). In other words, the compositional principle of the signal, as experienced, is more a continuous modulation of a dimension of perception, than an encoding of separate bits of data or a sequencing of units of meaning. Modulation is the very definition of the analogue signal—a continuous variation in amplitude and time (that is, a smoothly varying value).
