Architecturally, this is not uninteresting. The appearing of the optical effect is an event, and as such activates the architecture, and does so differently than archtiectural gestures that invite "reading" or "critique." The eventness overcomes the ornament/structure dichotomy that traditionally framing architecture, since what appears is a unitary stand-out effect fullfilling its own (symbolic) function and (non-architectural) aesthetic value. There is no application of a decorative element to a functional structure. The optical effect's function and aesthetic value are indissociable from each, innhabiting the same plane of their eventful standing-out.
