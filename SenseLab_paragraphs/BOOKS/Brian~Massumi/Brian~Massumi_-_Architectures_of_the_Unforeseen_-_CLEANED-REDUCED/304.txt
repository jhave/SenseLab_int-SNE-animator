Tens of thousands of people watched, at home or in the square. What they saw was culturally and politically loaded. The ZÃ³calo is ringed by central Mexican government buildings, and because of that has a long history not only of government, but as a major site of demonstration and contestation against it. The spectators interacted with the apparatus. They could attach messages to their designs on the website archiving them. They interfaced. They gave the event personal and ideological content. But they did not only interact. The interaction accordioned them into relation, from which their accomplished acts of expression telescoped back out.
