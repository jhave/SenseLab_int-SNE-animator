Culturability: the fielding of relation underwriting interaction at its most incipiently abstract. This is the element of relational architecture in this period of Lozano-Hemmer's work. Culturability is what folds into the cultural act's coming to its own expression as the manner of event it stages: in other words as medium of expression. It is the ever almost-there of the cultural act, in-forming. Culturability is the forerunner of the cultural act: its -ability to come (again). Thought-sign of culture re-coming to figure in relation.
