There is no reason to stop there. You can always continue the continuum. You could go on deforming in either direction, past the demoted sphere or the tortured horse-shoe. You could twist and turn some more, stretch and compress, on to any number of other forms. The thing is: they all belong to the same topological figure. They are all effects mutually included in the same transformation. Their relation to each other is one of mutual inclusion in one and the same process. The process itself is their mutual inclusion. It is the continuum that sucks them in, one and all. There is another word for “mutual inclusion.” The relation of the overall topological figure to any of the forms that can be extracted from it is that of immanence.
