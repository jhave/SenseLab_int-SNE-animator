Lynn loves it. There is a palpable sense of joy and even abandonment in his discussions of topology.iv Yet love it as you might if you want to design with it you have to figure out how to instrumentalize it. You have to domesticate the beast to some extent. Lynn unironically regards his topologically-trained computer as a not entirely house-trained “pet” introducing a degree of “wildness” into the designer’s “domestic habits.”v When you instrumentalize the topological creature, you find yourself loving your instrument. This is one of the things that stands out most in Lynn’s design practice. He enters wholeheartedly into a relationship with his tools. He joyously embraces what are traditionally considered incidentals, mere practicalities, and welcomes them to the life, and heart, of architecture. As we will see, this embrace extends from the incidentals to the outside: to what are usually considered constraints on architectural design, or even downright obstacles. That is how the many extra-instrumental things an historian of architecture might see as external “contextual” influences are apt to appear to the practicing architectural author. Obstacles: all that cluttery stuff out there that leaves unsightly sedimentary traces in the purely conceived forms of authorial prerogative. Dirty little things, like zoning, budgets, prevailing tastes, preservation movements, the weather, engineering considerations, clients with an irritating tendency to have preferences, gravity, people who live or work in buildings, so annoyingly-often in ways contrary to their program. Messy little things, like the world.
