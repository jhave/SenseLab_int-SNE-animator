What Lynn is against is not the body, but the subject, understood in any foundational way. And as the foregoing discussion of his concept of animate form should have made clear by now, he is not a formalist, but a processualist. What animates his work is a commitment to a process of becoming-architectural that is its own dynamic subject: a subjectless subjectivity one with its running; driven by its own on-going in-folding of formative forces; constituted by that very movement, which it can only recursively call its own.
