The edginess comes from the same place the procedure's power comes from. Art as a means without end for re-tracing life's happenstances in a minor key of joy and emergent sensibility has no predesignated style. The artist does not think of herself as having a medium, and says that she does not work from materials. She works from passing through. This makes her hard to place. It is not clear what category she belongs to as an artist. The impossibility of belonging threads through every stage of the journey. She is never cured of it.
