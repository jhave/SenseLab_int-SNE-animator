In the case of the architectural surface, the membrane, though physically static, is active. Its physical form co-organizes the body-events that occur in the fold between the fields. As with the hypothetical stadium-wave tarp, the concrete surface doubles an abstract surface. It is the sensible index of an eventful becoming-body that as such is nonsensuous. The body-event occurs once again on the affective register – now of inhabitation rather than fandom. Unlike the stadium wave, the concrete form does not physically present the dynamic form of the abstract body-event. The configuration of walls, roof, floors does not have the same rhythm and patterning as the body-event – which is so many-dimensioned as to defy geometric expression in itself. In this sense, the concrete architectural surface is a disjunctive expression of the fusional multiplicity for which it stands. Architectural body-events are made visible in concrete architectural form, while having their own form different from theirs. It is because of this disjunction that it is possible to consider the concrete architectural surface "formally." By that I mean separately from the dynamic form of inhabitation; in extension, as a standing geometric configuration, bracketing the intensive matter for which it stands, in its very making visible of it.
