Lynn’s refusal of metaphor sometimes comes across as a refusal to think beyond the design stage. What of the completed design? What of the built form? When he sidelines metaphor, and with it symbolism, stylistic allusion, and signification – so dear to so many twentieth-century architects – is he abandoning the building to its literal functioning? When all is said and done, does he end up a default modernist in topological clothing, allowing form to meld with function yet again? Is there any way the “station” extracted from the topological design process can retain something of the relational dynamism and multiplicity of the process that generated it?
