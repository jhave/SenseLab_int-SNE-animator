In part one of this chapter, relational architectural works such as "Displaced Emperors," "Re:Positioning Fear," and "Vectorial Elevation" were seen to operate in the element of "culturability," the field in which cultural acts gestate, and from which they emerge to single themselves out as determinate relational moves. The region of real, proximate potential in-forming that event – its processual neighborhood – was termed the "cultural domain" (with reservations as to the spatial connotations of the term). Does "Amodal Suspension" swim in the same element? Is its operative domain also cultural? Is the cultural act its event-medium as well? How could it not be if, as in the first three works discussed, "Amodal Suspension" also harnesses the emergent force of human language, in a zone of indistinction with gesture? Isn't language one with culture?
