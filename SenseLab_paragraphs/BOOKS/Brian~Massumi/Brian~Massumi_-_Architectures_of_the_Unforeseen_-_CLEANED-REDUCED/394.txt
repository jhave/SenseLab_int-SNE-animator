Gossip is a machine for bringing expression a step back from the deadening internal limit of regulated intersubjective interaction toward that zone of indistinctly potentiated fusional marking the fold where the social act overlaps with the open field of culturability. Gossip backsteps from the historic achievement of culture that is the speaking bourgeois subject toward an ever-rolling, sometimes rollicking, movement of unregulated sociability, in overlap with culturability but mundanely off-set from its cosmic continuum. Gossip has been characterized as many things, but cosmic is not one of them.
