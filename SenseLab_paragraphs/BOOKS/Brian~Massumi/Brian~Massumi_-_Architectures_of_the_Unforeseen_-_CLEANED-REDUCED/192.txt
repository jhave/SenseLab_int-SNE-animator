At any moment, the process can turn back on itself, fold back in, and start over again, reenergizing the generative field for a renewed iteration. Every stop is a potential return and recontinuation. The generative matrix accompanies the process. It is present potentially at every step of every run – requiring only a cut to continue again, a stop to rebegin. This does qualify the matrix as a certain kind of origin, but one whose nature is in displacement: a vagrant origin that follows the movements of its offspring like a wandering spirit – without actually going anywhere, because it is more that their process that returns to its always accompanying virtual ubiquity. Simondon solemnifies this kind of origin with the official moniker of "absolute origin."xcii
