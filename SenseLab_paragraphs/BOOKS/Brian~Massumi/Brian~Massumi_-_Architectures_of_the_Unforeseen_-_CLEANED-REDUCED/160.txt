The surface of perception is an abstract membrane. Bodily subgestures fold out across it, into the overgesture of action. At the same time, in lock-step, the process folds back in-across, in an affective reflux returning the action to its source, readying another go. The folding-in takes the form of memory and habit, and their joint production, anticipation, all affectively tinged and weighted. Memory, habit, and anticipation bathe the entire multi-level architecture and all its component proto-actors with differentials of potential. The differentials are between the affective tinging of various elements, and the way that variable weighting tips the traces of present, just past, toward the future. The differential between the past and the future is the primary differential. It marks all of the elemental proto-actors, defining them as tendencies, needs, or desires â€“ future-facing dynamics conditioned by the past. These come in crowds, in tension with one another. The differential between the tensions energize the coming iteration. The next whole-body step is the the working out of their tensions, their resultant. Their resultant expression vectorizes life's generative field, orienting its coming issuings into action in the ongoing expressive movement of variation that is life. These energizing, vectorizing differentials are abstract formative forces: a differential sets in between. It has no form but that betweenness, which is nonsensuous. It has no concrete form. It is purely abstract;  so abstract that the formative activity is largely nonconscious. These differentials compose the virtual field of emergence for life's taking integral dynamic form. They in-form the generative field's issuing, across its many levels and multitude of components, into iterative action-sequences globally addressing the continuing problem proper to life: how to act so as not to die; how best to live.lix
