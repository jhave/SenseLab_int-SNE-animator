Lynn is silent on this question. But it is his own ideas of the body that might provide a starting point for an answer. Body-events are never neutral. They are never on an equal footing. Their manner of unfolding from the generative field continues across many an asperity. Their coming to expression straddles many an asymmetry. Most of all, the affective force of their taking integral effect distributes itself unevenly, in a tensional field riven by separatrixes. The open field of life into which the design process flows is, like the generative field of the design process itself, a differential field. In the field of life, the differentials between the design process's basins of attraction and repulsion recapitulate as differentials of economic and cultural access, and in different manners in which the follow-on effects can be further transduced: different degrees and kinds of capacitation or disenablement; different dispositions and tendencies. The affective force of the design effluviates into a complex landscape throughout which its effects are unequally distributed, and qualitatively vary. The transductive process cannot but continue on this, political, level. Iterate that. The topological design process owes it to itself to fold this dimension in to its foldings-out.
