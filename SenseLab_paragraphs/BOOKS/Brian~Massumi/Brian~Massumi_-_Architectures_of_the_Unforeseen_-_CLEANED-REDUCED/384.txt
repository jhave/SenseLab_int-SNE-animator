There is only one word for language segregated from theme and reduced to its semantic content and formal structure: "dead."lvii Society, understood as a public sphere at a decorous remove from the "inner personality," is the death of culturability as it is understood here: as a relationally mutational regenerative movement running the nature-culture to the cosmic limit. Ironically, the death of culturability is an historic cultural achievement. It is a product of enculturation taking itself to the public-private extreme (corresponding, not uncoincidentally, with the fixing and regulation of the internal limit of the human).
