One of the things she did here (there) was to begin collecting. Collecting things normally plays on a strong sense of origins. The thing collected is a token of attachment to the place and time of its origin, of which it stands as the enduring trace, carefully identified and labeled. The attachment to the collected thing is to an enduring out of its place after its time. The investment in the collected thing, in present time, care and attention, in anticipation and temporarily satisfied longing, draws one in to this. There is something inherently melancholic and nostalgic about collecting. It shares this characteristic with all endeavors playing on a sense of origin. Is not any original sense of identified-labeled belonging, whether to a nation or an ethnicity or even a city or a neighborhood, or again to a gender or an age or a stage of life, a melancholic-nostalgic attachment to enduring traces? Are these not ways in which we collect ourselves? Ways of regaining our composure in the essentially out-of-place? For an origin is by nature out of place â€“ forever at a distance in the always-before of this after-time. Like birth.
