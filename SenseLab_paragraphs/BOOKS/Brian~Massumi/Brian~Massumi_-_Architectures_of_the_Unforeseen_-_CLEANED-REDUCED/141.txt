The presence of the in-stadium cameras highlights the affective dimension of the event. Affect provides a way of answering the question of whether there is such a thing as a body without a surface. The answer is no. At least, not concretely. The dynamic form of the stadium wave is a self-propagating rhythm, not a surface in any usual sense. But it does agitate something: affect. Its rhythm rolls and rises: affectively. The wave has the shape of an enthusiasm.l Affect is the abstract surface upon which the wave inscribes itself. It is into affect that the myriad formative factors of the open field of conditions in-fold. The affect then eddies on itself, through the feedback provided by the in-stadium cameras. The eddying doesn't' stand in place. It energizes the unfolding of the wave's continuing formation. This is not a standing wave. It is a wave that rolls affect in, to roll itself over and onward, in the process transmitting the affect to bodies not participating actively in its production.
