It is after the construction of the Korean Presbyterian Church that the problem of surface becomes the organizing node of Lynn's work. The word "body" all but disappears from Lynn's vocabulary in the 2000s. The body-event continues to figure, but largely implicitly, wrapped in surfacings. Body-related questions of perception, even of aesthetics, are by no means absent. They resurface in new ways, although not entirely divorced from the traditional concepts of form in the history of architecture. But as always, form is subjected to a decidedly processual twist whose dynamic it is important to understand in order to appreciate Lynn's adventitious relation to the discipline whose interiority he never respected, but which he never rejected.
