The eventuating of a next step is the other half of the two-way movement. The move that comes is determined in the course of its occurrence to have been just as it was. It has specifically taken place. It will become a specific difference. Its having specifically, differently taken place has given grist for memory. It has expressed a memorable affective orientation all its own. It has renewed behavioral or ideational tendencies, in a new variation, or it has run counter to them. It has furthered or confounded habit. It has rescaled its potential reach. It has achieved particularity. What it has been, has been determined. It has individuated. Its taking place has taken its place. In its individuality, it is positioned vis-Ã -vis other similarly determinate acts, occupying reciprocal positions in a cultural landscape. It has become a coordinate in a territory, or a domain. The movement of the cultural act toward its individuality is a territorialization. The inverse movement whereby it rejoins its relational potential in expectant suspense of what it will come to be, in and as the incipiency of that becoming, is a deterritorialization. The two movements, though inverse, are coincident: two facets of the same event. When Lozano-Hemmer spoke of "dematerializing" the environment, he could have said "deterritorializing" the act instead.
