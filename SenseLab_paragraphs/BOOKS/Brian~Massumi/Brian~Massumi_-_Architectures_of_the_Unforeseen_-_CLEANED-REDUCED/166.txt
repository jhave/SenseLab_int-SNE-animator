Lynn's work converges toward the surface as his privileged angle of attack. Spuybroek focuses on perception (as do Arakawa and Gins). That difference in approach imparts an angular momentum to the respective design practices that makes all the difference when it comes to their techniques and the terms in which the problem of design is posed and theorized. In the course of Lynn's practice, the question of the body segues into a concern with the problem of the surface.  The concern for the surface in turn segues into a concern for how surfaces perform. For Spuybroek, on the other hand, the question of perception unfolds into an exploration of material potentials, guided by the problem of intensive matter.lxv Lynn's move to surface and then through surface to performance circles the design practice back toward questions of functionality. Spuybroek's work does not of course ignore function, but because of his perceptual angle of attack, function comes wrapped up in the material qualities of experience carried by the ebbs and flows of intensive matter, rather than streamlining into a vector of performance.
