The extra-effect or force of language – the experienced something-extra that conveys an emphasis, accent, tone, or mood – that is staged in "Amodal Suspension" is the power of language to rhythmically regather its active relation to itself and the open field of its murmurous outside, in a pulsed continuation of the always-crossed lines of communication. To assist in the regathering, the project includes its own automatically compiled digital archive.
