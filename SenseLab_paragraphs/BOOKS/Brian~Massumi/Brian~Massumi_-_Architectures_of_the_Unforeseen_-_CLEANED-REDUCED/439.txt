The emptiness of the artist's little nothings clears a way for her. She, like them, is without alibi in the city into which she has landed. The knowledge that whenever she ventures out more collectable nothings will have fallen in whatever path she takes becomes a lure to go out and move through the city. Her movements are not purposeful, for example in the way a worker's beelining to the office is. They are not exactly purposeless, either. The lure of the naughts yields a third way: a direction without a purpose. The direction is not toward any particular point. It is toward venturing out, and passing through. Just being out, in movement through the city, with a heightened attentiveness to what may present itself, but no agenda. "Just nosing," she calls it. Or in Malaysian pidgin, "looksee looksee."
