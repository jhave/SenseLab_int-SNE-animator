Now if you ask what space two different topological figures share, you’d have to imagine atoms of continuity in the same virtual void. But lacking scale or position, they couldn’t be spatially distinct strictly speaking. It’s a misnomer to call their mutual inclusion a “space.” Although in their immanence they are not spatially distinct, they are still differentiated. The image you end up with is of tirelessly (and coffee-cuplessly) differentiating atoms of continuity in a state of virtual superposition. Like dynamic monads swirling about in the same animated abstractness.
