Unlike the earlier works, "Amodal Suspension" contrives not to stretch itself amoebically out-of-scale to the maximum extent. Its falls shy of full-force becoming-other, setting its approach to the immanent limit at the point where the force of language enters a zone of indistinction with the animal. This is the zone where language shades into gesture, and the coded linguistic sign into the firefly flash of the signal. Gesture remains intimately tied to the emergent force of human language (the better to be in a position to disenable the internal limit of the human) even as it enters a zone of indistinction with the animal. However large the installation, however long the beams, however sprawling and complex the technological apparatus, the participant act remains a grab at words. The kinesthetic amoeba is suspended in its reach for language. That reach is performed independently of the content of the words, which may never be known to any given reacher, and is in every case detoured, thirded, and set a-sea in the sky.
