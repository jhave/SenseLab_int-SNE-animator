The cosmic limit, by contrast, is an immanent limit. There is no going beyond an immanent limit.xlvii However far the present stretch, there is a still a potential further reach. The immanent limit is always ever-more approachable. It infinitely recedes from reach. The closer a movement comes to it, the more intensely it recedes, into its own potential. At each approach to this limit, the cultural act is amoebically reborn. It rebounds, renewed by a reinfusion with potential. It relationally rearises, in sea-tossed variation. Rather that backing-and-forthing in call-and-response, it rises and subsides in an abandon of mutational heaving. Rather than responsibly safeguarding, it rythmically mates its eventful fate.
