With Malaysian-Australian photographer and installation artist Simryn Gill, the duration was more constrained: basically, a month. But it was a month that offered an opportunity to make the kind of processual fellow-traveling I had experienced with Lynn and Lozano-Hemmer a planned practice, distilled into a procedure suited to the time-frame available. I proposed a series of recorded discussions where Gill would describe her process, what moves it, and what concepts she mobilizes in order to move with it. Key terms would surely stand out in the discussions, proposing themselves as formulae: terms that both trouble and potentialize the work, standing for problematic nodes around which Gill's practice bestirs itself and takes shape. I would take these constitutive problems up into my own writing, in the exact terms in which Gill articulated them. I would then nudge them into a becoming-philosophical. By that I mean giving them the kind of consistency native to philosophic practice.
