The divergences are a function of the angle of attack. As the foregoing analysis of the body was meant to demonstrate, the concrete surface of architecture and the abstract surface of perception are reciprocals. They fold into and out of each other in many a manner, fusing-forth integral effects, lived as body-events – without in any way blurring of the essential difference between abstract and concrete surfaces. It goes without saying that we do not confuse perception with architecture, or vice versa, even though they bodily interfuse. It is perhaps because of that nonconfusion we don't appreciate often enough the nature of their processual embrace – its dynamic abstractness. Embracing topological architecture is not a question of choosing the coolness of form over the thickness of lived experience. There is no alternative between concrete and abstract. That way of construing it, and the associated deprecatory accusations of formalism often addressed to architects like Lynn, miss the point entirely. The point is that the abstract and the concrete go processually together. The sensible, concrete surface of architecture and the abstract surface of perception, waving with intensive affective matter, on which architectural body-events nonsensuously register, are two facets of the same topological figure. They are in as intimate an embrace as the two sides of a Möbius strip.
