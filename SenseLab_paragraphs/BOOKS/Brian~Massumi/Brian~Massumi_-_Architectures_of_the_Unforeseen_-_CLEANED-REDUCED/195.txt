A benefit is that this approach operationalizes mass customization. The streamlining of the technique overcomes the opposition between mass-production and custom-tailoring. This creates economies that take curvilinear design out of the architectural stratosphere and make it generally affordable. The direct feed-in to CNC milling is the great economizer. The end-forms can be sectioned, as was done with Predator, milled with CNC, and then assembled. This gives techniques predicated on topological continuity, not so long ago the province of the international archtiectural elite, the democratizing practical advantages of modularity. The CNC tool-paths may be used again, as in Predator, to crown the fusion of form-generation with atmospheric aesthetic effect. Because they share the same basic generational matrix, different projects can be promiscuous, coming together in a family way, across their differences.
