Even while the body and its movements continually resurface in the mention of things like lighting, aperture, and spatial inflection,lxxxix the concept of body is never again appealed to explicitly. And why should it be? Saying the word would just cause confusion. Inorganic, nonhuman bodies are difficult for organic, human heads to wrap their heads around. Body talk would just bring phenomenological misunderstandings back in force. This is not a loss of the body, because surface talk implicitly includes both kinds of bodies: the inorganic nonhuman body that is the dynamic form of the architectural body-event, and the organic human body that serves as one of the conditioning limits, in transductive relation to the concrete surface of the event's construction. Talking about surfacing is just a shorthand for talking about bodying. Techniques for one are techniques for the other. Which means that the converse is true: speaking about the body is speaking about surfacing. "Dynamic form" is a handy synonym for this mutual inclusion. The term "embodied" cognition as applied to this is something of a misnomer. The "surfacing of experience" as a bodying would be the more accurate way to say it. When Spuybroek or Arakawa and Gins speak of the perceptual body in ways that suggest embodied cognition, they are figuring the body as a co-generator of emergent dynamic forms rather than as a receiver of already-constituted static forms. This is a way of speaking about the intetgral abstract surface of archtectural becomings-body in other words.
