It takes little effort to see how different this metaphorical process is from the topological design process, for which no form is pregiven. The starting point is force, rather than form. The forces are multiple, cohabiting an active space. They figure in that space as differentials composing an intensity rather than exhibiting an identity. To be more exact, they prefigure in that space, because they are proto-formal and proto-functional. No set of visible formal properties or determinate function can be assigned to them as yet. These will come of the process of the intensity's playing out. The form of that playing out – the continuity of topological transformations involved – is hypertypological. That is, it is constituvely multiply and irreducible to a general class. Neither can its constitutive multiplicity be reduced to a plurality of particular cases belonging to general classes. It is not particular-general but singular-generic. What defines the nature of the figure are the transitions it effects toward its own mutual inclusion of potential forms. The process does not labor in the domain of function; it moves in the realm of potential. Virtuality is its element. The figure is not fundamentally functional, symbolic, or signifying. It is purely operative. It has no inherent properties, only parameters of movement and transformation. Likeness – sameness, identity, resemblance – are not of its nature. Its nature is in transformation. It is only at the end, after the process stops, at the point at which a freeze-frame is extracted and the topological figure falls out of its immanence to its own playing-out, that any of the formal characteristics that ground the possibility of metaphor take root. Taken as a stand-alone form, its marking by the process is interpreted as an expression of architectural style against the background, no longer of its own formation, but of the history of the discipline.
