In "Amodal Suspension" people send short text messages to each other using a cell phone or web browser. But rather than being sent directly to their intended recipients the messages are encoded as unique sequences of flashes and “deposited” in the sky, awaiting collection. A searchlight designated by the sender beams the message and rotates. Then a random second searchlight picks up the code, and the two beams intersect, flashing in unison. No sooner do they connect, however, than the first beam extinguishes. A third random searchlight then takes up the message, intersecting with the second. The messages are relayed in this fashion from one pair of searchlights to another, in a dance of lights. This touch-and-go mating of asexual rays is the only coupling that effectively takes place.
