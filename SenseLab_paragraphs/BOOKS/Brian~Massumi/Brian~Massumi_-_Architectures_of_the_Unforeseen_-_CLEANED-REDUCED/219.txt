Lozano-Hemmer is quite clear. The absenting of the body is not what is at stake in his work. It is not the body that is dematerialized but the “environment.”iii This means something very close to another formula he is fond of: “the object becomes performance.” Relational architecture takes the body to be what it performs. What it performs in this work is extending connection to out-of-scale activity.
