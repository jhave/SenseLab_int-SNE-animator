This might be considered a cop-out. Or it might be considered a principled practice of a different artistic politics: one that does not see its role to inculcate a particular awareness or analysis so as to make certain predefined follow-up actions seem necessary or inevitable. More modestly, this is a practice of programming conditions of incipiency. What might follow is pointedly vague, left tendentially open. It is up to the participants to stoke their own follow-up (or not). The role of relational architecture is not rigidly inculcative, nor even mildly instructional. It is modestly expressive, despite its flirting with the monumental. It expresses changeability – change felt but as yet undefined – through modulatory fusion occurring across the collective surface of a building. The expression is exemplary, as opposed to prescriptive.
