In chapter 1, the encounter with Lynn's work cascaded from the problem of the reality of abstraction to the problem of the body. Where is the body in animate form? The question is a common one often raised in a tone of accusation against Lynn's, dismissed as a mere formalism from which the body is absent. The body, however, was a central concern of Lynn's in his writings on architecture of the 1990s. In keeping with the problem of abstraction, this was an abstract body. What ever could that be? And why does the very word "body" disappear from Lynn's vocabulary in the 2000s? Where did it go? The central concern of his designs and writings seems to shift to the surface. Surface, after all, is a squarely (or in this case, curvaceously) architectural concern. What is the relation between body and surface? What else shifts when the body surfaces? The essay strives to follow the vicissitudes of Lynn's evolving practice through these shifts. Since Lynn himself has never enunciated the shifts in so many words, the more concertedly the philosophizing follows his process, the more monstrously it drifts from anything Lynn would ever say. The more problematically overlapped the processes become, the more fork-tongued is the outcome.
