It's "with." It's the "with" of processual fellow-traveling, in the mode of immanent critique as I understand it: the aparallel evolution of processes entering into mutually constitutive overlap, the better to transductively diverge again to further their own singularity. If it's about anything, it's about becoming-different-together in a relationship-specific movement courting the limit of the thinkable.
