"It is noise," Evens writes, "that binds the signal" and that serves as "a baseline, a plane of relief against which signal stands out."xxxvi He describes noise as a background to signal, but not in the visual sense, where the static background is in contrast with the discreteness of the form that stands out against it. His use of the word “relief” suggests a geological image. Noise is like the underlayer from which signal, with its message content, rises in relief, upfolding under pressure from tectonic forces. Signal stands in relation to noise as a mountain rises from the continually shifting ground. A mountain is mute testimony to the past action of forces of emergence of the earth, and to the certainty that future tectonic shifts will continue to reshape the landscape. Like a peak, signal stands out against the generative, and regenerative, forces of its own tectonic formation.
