By effective limits is meant processual limits: the poles between which the process of their coming to expression passes, and whose polarity must be seen as activating that passage. Processual limits must be counted as formative event-factors. They are constitutive, akin to what in chapter 1 was called the performance envelope of an emergence. The creative tension of their polarized differential describes the shape of an open field of emergence as it passes into domainal proximity. A careful recap is necessary to distill the constitutive limits of culturability and sociability as co-operating open generative fields.
