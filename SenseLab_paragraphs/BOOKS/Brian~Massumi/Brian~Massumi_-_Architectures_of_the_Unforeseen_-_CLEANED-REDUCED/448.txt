Say, in addition to collecting little nothings, she also collects the small epiphanies she encounters en route. That would raise different questions, beyond what am I doing here? For example, can the happenstance of a place be transferred elsewhere? Can its quality be conveyed? Can you put it into words? Unlikely, because one wouldn't be liable to call it an even small epiphany if there were not something of the ineffable in it. Then can it be photographed? How do you go about photographing not an object or a place, but a happenstantial quality? What happens when happenstances from different places are combined together in an elsewhere stranger to them all? Through this displacement can one reconstitute the lived refractive background of place? How can that encountered connectability be conveyed so that it does not allow itself to be weighed down by the history of a place, or contained by its identity, or tethered to the official belongings attaching to these? Can one capture that elusive background, whose appearing comes precisely from emptying the place of just such ballast, in favor of a drift in the purposeless direction of a different kind of care and attentiveness open to an emergent sensibility to place?
