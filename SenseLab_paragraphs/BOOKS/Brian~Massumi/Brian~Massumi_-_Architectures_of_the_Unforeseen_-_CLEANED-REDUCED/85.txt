As the most cursory glance at the history of Newton’s laws of motion show, however, the determined behavior of gravity has been less than exemplary. If you have two bodies – two gravitational basins of attraction – the interaction is calculable. The movement expressing their relation is regular and predictable. With three bodies, something happens. The interaction between three relational sub-fields is mathematically incalculable and empirically unpredictable. A margin of indeterminacy enters the interaction. The interference patterns between the basins of attraction create thresholds of undecideability. When one of the bodies approaches a threshold, it is impossible to know its subsequent path with certainty. Gravity is exemplary after all: it is the text-book example of “deterministic chaos.” That term refers to the fact that relational-field effects (“resonance” in Poincaré’s vocabulary) can be counted on to undetermine what by formal definition are the most predictable of things: natural forces.xx
