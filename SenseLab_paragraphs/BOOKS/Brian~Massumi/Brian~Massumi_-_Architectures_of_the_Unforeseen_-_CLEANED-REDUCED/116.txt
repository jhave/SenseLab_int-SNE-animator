Entirely in character, Lynn uses a geometric concept to tackle this problem. The thresholds discussed earlier between basins of attraction and repulsion in the active topological field are termed “separatrices.” A separatrix is a curve featuring in a dynamic interaction of different orders of forces whose difference plays out across a threshold to selective effect. In the cloud example, the cooperating forces of mass and rigidity made visible in the spherical form of the particles interacted with the topological field in such a way that the particles separated themselves out by crossing thresholds into different basins. Their distribution could not be predicted in detail, on a particle by particle basis, but it nevertheless followed a certain probability pattern. The selection effected at the separatrix carries a margin of indeterminacy that does not preclude stability. The stability, however, is not foundational. It arises from a dynamic process after a certain duration, and for a certain duration. A stability of this kind is called a “metastability.” A metastability emerges. It has the character of an event. It cannot erase the indeterminacy of its generative process or the expunge specter of ultimate instability that goes with it. Still, it has probability on its side. For this reason, it remains stable within certain parameters, or within a “performance envelope.”
