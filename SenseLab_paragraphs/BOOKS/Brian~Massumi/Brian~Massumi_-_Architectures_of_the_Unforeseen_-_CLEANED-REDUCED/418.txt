"Hardscrabble (ORIGIN early nineteenth century): place thought of as the epitome of barrenness." The hardscrabble labor of massive machinery has hollowed out the land. It has overlaid the history of the place with a hole, which now epitomizes it. It is as if the surrounding land were under obligation to mirror the emptiness of the excavation in its own expanse. What else is a mine, other than a taking of the earth for tabula rasa? "(ORIGIN Latin) 'scraped tablet,' denoting a tablet with the writing erased."
