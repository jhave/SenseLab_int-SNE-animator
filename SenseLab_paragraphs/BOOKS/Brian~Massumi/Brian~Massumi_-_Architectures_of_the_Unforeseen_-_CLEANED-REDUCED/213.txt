Most times, my shadow hovers close, its tip a modest leap away. Not that I can reach it. It shies one step ahead. Although I can never catch up with it, I can easily reach where its end just was (where it now begins). It is perhaps for this that I have never lamented my shadow. I have never experienced it as a negative of my body, wraithlike symbol of a haunting absence to myself. It has always seemed to be just what it is: a projection. Not so much of my body’s outline as its action. Its always beginning where my moving to catch up projects my action one step ahead of itself, in modest measure, on a scale with my body’s everyday gestures. Rather than foreshadowing death, my shadow gives me a measure of my next human step. It casts my coming action in the world. It is the shape of my body in a future tense, penumbra of potential. My shadow comforts me. As long I fail to catch up with it, I know I am alive.
