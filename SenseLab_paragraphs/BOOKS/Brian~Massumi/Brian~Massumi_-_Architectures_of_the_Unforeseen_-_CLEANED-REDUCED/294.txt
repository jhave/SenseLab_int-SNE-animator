The cultural act is "participative," partaking. It partakes of the potential of the cultural domain in-forming it. The act’s accomplishment is triggered by a bodily response on the part of a participant to what actually appears on the concrete surface of the interface. That response is interactive. The cultural act, in its surface manner, is interactive as opposed to relational (as is its domain and its domain's open field). The cultural domain potentiates the cultural act. It primes and modulates it. But it does so vaguely, in “dim” nonconscious “apprehension,” shadow of an act, forerun. The priming, or forerunning of the event, does not predefine the coming act in its particulars. That actual bringing to clear expression of the potential, in the form of a specific move, would not occur were its actual appearance not doubled by its forerunning (which simultaneously in-forms the act with real potential and out-runs it to limit of pure potential, in a simultaneous rising of the ground into the figuring of the act and its receding into far-real, ground of the ground). Cultural act, cultural domain, and field of culturability are coordinate degrees of each other. They are not substantially different, but differ by the degree of effective contraction of potential into the actual event's expression.xxxiii
