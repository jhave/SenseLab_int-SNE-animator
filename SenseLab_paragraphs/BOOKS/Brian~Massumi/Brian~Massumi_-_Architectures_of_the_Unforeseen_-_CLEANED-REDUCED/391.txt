And there is more. The receiver of the tidbit of reported speech is not involved in the exchange with a clearly individual status. He or she is equally present as the representative of what "people will think." Where there is gossip, there is a teeming crowd of "he saids" and "he said she saids" and "what people thinks" and "theys." In gossip, two's a crowd. The crowding is such that the distinction between social type ("they": people of an interested ilk, however ill-defined) and self-representing individual "I" is expressively blurred. The vagueness of the subject of speech is compounded by the fact that the evaluative accent with which the speech is reported does not distinguish between the present speaker's individual accent and the implied evaluation of the third- and fourth- party speakers whose potential voices echo on the line, or between the present listener and the virtually overhearing "they" that overpopulates the exchange. The "theme" of the language act is collectively owned in its speaking. It is no sooner emitted than it is already recognized by a virtually listening multitude pregnant (in the sense that a significant pause is said to be "pregnant") with an oversupply of implied response.
