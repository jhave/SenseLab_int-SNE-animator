Next question: can there be a wave without matter? Again, the answer is no. But this is a trick answer. The matter of the wave is not the hands of the wavers, as it might be tempting to say at first impression. It is not exactly hands that form the wave. Rather, it is their expressive gestures.  It is only because the hand motions are already in the gestural register, and the gestural register is already in the key of affect, that the wave is the body-event that it is. The hands lend themselves to the affective effect â€“ and disappear into it. Watching a stadium-wave is not to watch a bunch of hands waving. It is to see their integral effect, directly in the key of affect. The matter of the body-event is affect itelf. Affect is the intensive matter of the event. It constitutes the abstract surface registering the integral intensity of this singular event, bringing to affective expression the differential intensities of the contributing factors actively folding in to it.
