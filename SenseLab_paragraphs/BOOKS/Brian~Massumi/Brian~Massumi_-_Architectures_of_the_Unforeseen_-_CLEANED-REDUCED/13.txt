No, it's not "about." It's not about Greg Lynn, Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, or Simryn Gill, as biographical entities. It's not about architecture, digital art, or installation art, as disciplines or genres. It's certainly not about art history: how those biographies embed themselves in and contribute to the progressive development of their disciplines. At no time do I perform the gesture, considered de rigueur in academic discourse, of "situating" the practices I encounter with respect to these extrinsic determinant frameworks. Never do I judge the aesthetic quality or social/political value of the work according to external criteria. And when I've said "I" in this introduction, it's not with pronomical propriety and a claim to ownership. It's not about any of that.
