Is there a contradiction in making a move beyond biography using a biographical detail, and in an essay that started on a biographical note, no less? Not at all. To see it as a contradiction would be to mistake biography for life, and the personal for the world. To live beyond biography is to relate to biographical detail as you would a sacred paving stone or the ring from a soda bottle top: as a trigger for a movement of expression, in the world and of the world.
