The cultural act is primed by its forerunning, but not predetermined by it. As it actually happens, the act occurs on its own enactive terms. It occurs selectively, fusing a certain bandwidth of mutual inclusion, to consciously perceived effect. The cultural act surfaces in the mode of interaction as a participative autonomy, partaking of potential. As it comes to actual fruition in its own terms, it figures itself interactively. Yet it still “essentially lives” – lives more far-reachingly than its sensuous surface appearance – in the potential domain of its relational infra -ability. Its taking-place is more extensively “relationship-specific” than it is interactively site-specific. The appearing form in which the cultural act surfaces is an interactive response to a sensuous display. But the cultural act is not reducible to the form of its appearance. It has nonsensuous stretch in it, shading off into the unappearing. The cultural act is the tip of the iceberg of its own infra-active potentiation and tendential modulation. It is able to select potential because it participates also in its more-than. It can appear in interaction because it relates. It can have its expressed domain because it also fields what recedes from that expression.
