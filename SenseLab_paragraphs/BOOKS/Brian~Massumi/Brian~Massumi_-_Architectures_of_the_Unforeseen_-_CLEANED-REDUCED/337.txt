When a new sound rings out, it ripples the surface of this cosmic echo. From the rippling, it peaks. Its own vibration resonates with the silence-nearing background buzz, or forms interference patterns with it. The resonance and interference of the background noise is a condition of the new soundâ€™s emergence, but also becomes an ingredient in it, contributing to its timbre or giving it an undertone. The emerging signal peaks from the background of noise. Given the energetic, vibratory nature of its ground, it is perhaps less like a mountain peak than a wave, cresting on the sea. A wave can be thought of as contracting the calm of the sea into a new swell. The cresting of the wave gives new focus to the imperceptible stirrings of the deep, whose potential energy is brought once again to forceful expression. The emergent wave gives focus and expression to the forces of the sea, as the sea gives direction to the wave: toward the shore.
