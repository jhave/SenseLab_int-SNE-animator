The cultural domain does not preexist fully formed, and does not have any stable configuration. The wooden concept of cultural-historical "context" is just a stagant still-image of it. The cultural domain is performatively drawn by the cultural act, for its own coming to pass in that vicinity. The cultural domain is co-emergent with the act. With each act it reemerges in a new variation. Companion acts co-occupy it, each with distinctive difference. The cultural domain is an event dimension of the acts' coming to pass in serial variation and processual neighborhood.
