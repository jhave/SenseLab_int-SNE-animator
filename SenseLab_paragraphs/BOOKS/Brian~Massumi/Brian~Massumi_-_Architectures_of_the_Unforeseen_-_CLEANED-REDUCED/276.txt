That event is always a stretch. The act in which the event culminates, such as the reading of words with one's shadow on a fa√ßade, stretches its incipiency out across a fusional field of many a level and of indeterminate expanse. Its occurrence contracts that field of emergence into the punctuality of the act's performing, vaguely drawing its entirety into the region of clarity of its determinate taking-place. Folding out, folding in, in a single two-way movement of integral coming-to-expression in the discreteness of an act. The integral presence of the field of emergence is expressed in the manner of the discrete act: its unique inflection; the just-thus of its performance; its such-as-it-isness; its style. The manner of an act is the dynamic trace of its in-forming by its field of emergence. Its gestural sweeep composes the dynamic unity of the event, in expressive effect. Thus it is a stretch to say that  the medium of an act is the manner of the event it stages: the medium manneristically stretches all along the continuum, from the field of emergence at its most unfolded and more or less loosely encompassing, to the relational tightness of the field's fusional contraction into the punctuality of the act of expression.
