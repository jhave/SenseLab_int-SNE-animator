Ultimately, the question the internet poses for culture and society is what this adventitious subjectivity, now unleashed, can become. Whatever it becomes, its singular quasi-public/quasi-private status marked by ultimately disowned, de-positioned, irresponsiblized utterances, will ensure that its becoming will be a collective individuation.lxxviii Will it rejig the respective limits of the social and the cultural? Will it refigure their overlap and immanence? Will its monstrous complexity and tentacular stretch take sociabilty itself to the pseudopodic "cosmic" limit of culture? How will it redraw the map of the human territory, as it rests on the nature-culture continuum? Will it rejuggle the zones of indistinction between the human, the animal, the technological and the generative forces for variation that crest from them? There is no paucity of futuristic prognostications on these subjects. This essay will not add more. It will content itself to  briefly mentioning what all of this indicates has always been the case for language and communication, according to Peirce: that the "interpretant" of an expression is ultimately a "quasi-mind." This has always been the case â€“ now more than ever. Now Peirce will have the word.
