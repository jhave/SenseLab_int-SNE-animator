To exemplify is to invoke an indefinite set of instances, each of which is different but which are in a kinship and belong together, in a way that does not need to be spelled out. One example invites to another, and that other another, in a series potentially without end. Each example in the potentially continuing series includes all the others in itself, in that it implicitly presents itself as a variation on them – as they, should they eventuate, will include themselves as variations on the series. To exemplify is to populate the moment with virtual events of repeat-exemplification which immediately belong to each other, in mutual envelopment, even though each is absolutely singular. No two will share all their defining characteristics in a way that would allow them to be subsumed unequivocally or without remainder under the same general idea. The example, contrary to the common assumption, does not instantiate a type. It performs an immediately lived belonging to a lineage of typal variation. To exemplify is to populate a present event of expression with a lineage of virtual events of expression that belong together as kin, with all their differences – as differencings.
