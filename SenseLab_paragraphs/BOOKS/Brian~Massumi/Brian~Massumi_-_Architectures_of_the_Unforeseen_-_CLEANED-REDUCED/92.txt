In a way Eisenman was right to cry abdication. After all manner of contraints have been internalized into the process in the capacity of co-authoring growth factors, it is impossible to say exactly who is responsible for what. Each internalization of a constraint has added a determination. But each deterimination is only a part-determination. In the long run, the determinism of the process is chaotic, retaining an unexpungeable element of openness. The architect’s re-runs are part-decisions contributing to a process that is in the long run self-directing. The artist is a collaborator in a process of virtual expression that he can intentionally inflect or modulate but never completely control. As a willful individual, he is to the overall design process as his wafting on-screen particles are to their gradient field. His will is like a sphere: a surface rigidity silently bespeaking openness of relation. Creative will is a conscious bubble expressing in its apparently linear ordering a complex interplay of forces encompassing of any actual instance of decisiveness. Design is cloudy: a relation of relation between populations of co-factors taking more-or-less chaotic shape. The collaborative role the individual architect plays in the collective shape-taking is more a processual symbiosis subject to chance-driven evolutionary pressures – piloted by a self-regenerating internalization in the process, by the process, of its own external constraints – than the mastery of a program or design object.
