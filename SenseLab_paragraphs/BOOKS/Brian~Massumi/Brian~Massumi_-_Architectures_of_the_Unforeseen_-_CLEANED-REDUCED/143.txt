If you focus on the hands, you cease to see the wave. The hands as such are a disjunctive multiplicity, while the wave has the integral continuity of a fusional multiplicity. You can't have one without the other. But that doesn't make them the same. There is a minimal difference between a bunch of fleshy hands and their collective shape of enthusiasm. But this minimal difference makes all the difference. The activity of the hands enters into the wave through their gestural ability to agitate the abstract surface of affect. But the hands themselves do not enter into the wave. The wave folds their activity into its own composition. It does so only by taking off from their form, in order to come into its own. The event takes off from hand-matter, folding into intensive affective matter, which is the register in which the event effectively expresses itself.
