Metastability is exactly what you want when you board a sailboat. You don’t want the boat to have a hull whose functioning is invariant. If the hull didn’t respond variably to the motion of the waves and wind, the chaos of the sea would be directly transmitted to the boat, readily capsizing it. The process of designing a hull has to integrate contingency-sensitive variation into a single end form. “The abstract space of design is imbued with the properties of flow, turbulence, viscosity, and drag so that the form of the hull can be conceived in motion through the water ... The design space is conceived as an environment of force and motion .... The virtual force of the environment in which it is designed contributes to its shape.”xlii This is done not in order to make a hull that changes shape – any more than animate architecture seeks to construct buildings that move (a reductio ad absurdum often thrown at it). The aim is to wrap the potential for a multiplicity of responses into a single form. Depending on how the forces of the environment hit the hull and sails, the spine will toggle the boat into different postures or “points of sail.” The spine operates as a separatrix between postural “basins” of attraction, adapting the boat’s movement, at each buffet, to the environing turbulence. As a result the boat will be metastable: its motions will describe sailings more regularly than sinkings.
