We are no longer living in the mass media age. Debord and Baudrillard are so twentieth-century. The pronouncement of the end of the social was embarrassingly timed. It came at the threshold to the passage to a new regime. Sociability surreptitiously survived all along, and not only under the cover of art, waiting to make a comeback. Deadened, but not dead-ended. Where it survived, here and there, in local backwaters, was in gossip: hearsay. Its comeback took the name Internet: the technological reinvention of gossip, no longer as a slightly shameful local perversion of the public sphere troubled by unregulated personal expression leaking from  private circles, but as the universal of communication. With the Internet, hearsay becomes the "formal structure" of expression. In the youthful heyday of the mass media age, we had reporting, reliably attributed to identifiable sources (at least in theory). Now, rising phoenix-like from the ashes of the mass-media implosion of the social, we have Facebook. With social media, sociability makes a comeback, beyond both well-regulated society and the end of the social.
