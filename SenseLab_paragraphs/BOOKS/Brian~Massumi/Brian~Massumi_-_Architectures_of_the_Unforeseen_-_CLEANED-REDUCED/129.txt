It is possible to imagine similar gestures that could succeed in continuing the process generatively and not lead to the same impasse. For example, Lars Spuybroek experiments with building in strategic patches of perceptual vagueness that require an active, embodied response that triggers a kind of wayfinding through the built environment in the course of which new perceptual orientations, enveloping a potential for emergent functions, arise.xliii Arakawa and Gins also make use of vagueness, suspending the perceptual cues that normally anchor the body's orientation in the built environment. Their Biocleave House, for example, is built in such a way that there is no perceptible line of demarcation between floor, walls, and ceiling. Neither are there windows affording a view that would situate the house in its exterior milieu, offering vanishing points and a horizon line necessary for perspective. The elements of the interior architecture are conceived as "landing sites." These are affordances that partially resolve the vagueness of the surrounds, not into regions of clarity but into sites of ambiguity: just resolved enough to evoke the potential for a response, without prefiguring which response, for what function. This polyvalency is meant to break the mold of habit, and invite the body to improvise on its manner of inhabiting, reintensifying its experience of the built environment. The idea is to create the conditions for the emergence of new modes of life arising relationally, between the body and the surrounds. The architectural process continues in the betweening. There is no longer a body in a building, but a body-building(-life): an integral "architectural body" wrapping the differential between the body proper and its built environment into a single, continuing process of becoming, more intensely alive again.
