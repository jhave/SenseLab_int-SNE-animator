Lynn's love of high-performance vehicles, boats, cars, and motorcycles, is not a sideline. It is an integral expression of his architectural process, streamlining itself to the maximum. Looked at from another perspective, this can be seen as a taking of architecture to its limit. This is the point at which architecture has infolded its own outsides into its disciplinary "interior" so integrally that it can now easitly stretch itself between a tea pot and a BMW, in an self-stretching exercise in disciplinary yoga. The tea pot, while not a traditional architectural object, can at least find a place inside an architecture. The high-performance vehicle takes to the road. Its curvaceous form hugs to the highway curves, wedding its movement to the topography. The high-performance bifurcation of Lynn's architectural practice sets architecture speeding into the landscape, careening toward parts unknown. It takes off on a line of flight, one integrally extruded by the architectural process's saturation with its own expressed potential. The line of flight is an ulterior limit to the process, immanent to its self-running. It expresses its furthest possible reach, like a pseudopod extruding a supple body into an exploratory tentacle, extending its performance envelope beyond its bounds.
