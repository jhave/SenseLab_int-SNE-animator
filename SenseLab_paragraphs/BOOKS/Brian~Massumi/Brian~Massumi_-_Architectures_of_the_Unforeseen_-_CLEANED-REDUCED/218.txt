In designating “telembodyment” as the desired effect of “relational architecture” Lozano-Hemmer is going against the grain of the commonsense idea of what a body is – as well as of the pronouncement of its loss which was the signature theme of the “cyberculture” of the 1980s and 1990s which was the dominant context surrounding his work’s beginning. In our everyday lives we tend to think of the body as an object. An object, we also tend to think, is all and only where it is. Just that. Our body, being all that it is where it is, locates our lives. Just there. It anchors us in the particularity of our life environment. Our own small, social world: it too takes on the inescapable weight of a heavy object. To the cyberpunk aesthetic, this weighing down in the body-local was tantamount to imprisonment. The fantasy of jacking oneself into the computer offered a vision of liberation from the body and its weighty social contexts. Dematerialization. The “loss” was alternately celebrated and lamented.
