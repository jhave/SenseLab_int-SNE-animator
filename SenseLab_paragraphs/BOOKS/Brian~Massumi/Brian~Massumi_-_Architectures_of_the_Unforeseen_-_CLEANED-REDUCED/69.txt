What you bring up on screen bears an oddly analogical relation to the virtual passing through it. “Odd,” because the virtual is unclassifiable, comparable only to itself. But in order to program it, you have had to assign it a look, and having a look it inevitably falls into comparison. The virtual is no longer itself to the precise extent to which it resembles how we think of it and, in thoughtful resemblance, becomes comparable to other things. Rendering the virtual is an analogical procedure. However, the analogy produced is essentially without resemblance to its model. Another way of putting it is to say that the resemblance is precisely what is artificially produced.xii You have added to the world a semblance or double (a ‘simulation’) of the virtual through which it oddly returns to itself, on the run, as always self-differing. For the virtual, returned, has passed through and been conditioned by what it isn’t. The traces left by its return –the shapes generated on screen – will record an essential non-resemblance to its ongoing. The shapes are what the virtual looks like after it has passed on. They are its visible wake. They are its optical end-effect.
