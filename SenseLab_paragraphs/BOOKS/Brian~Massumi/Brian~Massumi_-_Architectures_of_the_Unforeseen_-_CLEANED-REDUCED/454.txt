There is a whimsical edginess to this. The whimsy lies in proceduralizing the unknown in so mundane a little-nothing way. There is a playfulness about tackling the unknown without all the self-important handwringing and pretentious second-guessing that often goes along with that. The whimsy is the humor of dedicating oneself to a minor practice of the unknown. The edginess comes because by this approach you are always in the middle of it, figuring it out as you go along. You never have it in hand. You're always reaching-for, moving forward, at the speed of life. What you're doing, as you're doing it, can't be described. It's like looking over a cliff, the artist muses. The ground of history and identity, one's rooting in already communicable meaning, has fallen out from under you. All you have left is a fickle background that makes its appearance in its own good time, taking you by surprise every time. There is no way of knowing en route, let alone in advance, if it will work. Until it does.
