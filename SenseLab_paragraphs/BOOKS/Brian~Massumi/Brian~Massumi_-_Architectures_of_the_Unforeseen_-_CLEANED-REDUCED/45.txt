Another way of saying this is to say that the topological figure is utterly singular: wholly and only its own process. It is a singular populated by particulars. So it is a multiple singular. Having no properties or invariant features, you would also have to characterize it as in some way generic. The topological figure is a strange figure unlike the usual logical entities with which we are in the habit of thinking. It is a multiple singular-generic.
