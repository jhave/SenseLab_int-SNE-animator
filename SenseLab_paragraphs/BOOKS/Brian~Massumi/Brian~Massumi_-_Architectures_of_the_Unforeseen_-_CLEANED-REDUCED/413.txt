These same issues are raised in the functioning of social media and the internet, and we put the question mark on them with every post. They were also raised, before the social media fact, by Lozano-Hemmer's relational architecture. Jacques Attali famously argued that the evolution of music heralds what Volo≈°inov called "crucial turning points" in the vicissitudes of the social and the cultural domains. "Amodal Suspension" raised the issue of the quasi-directness of social relation in 2003, a year before the founding of Facebook. In the decade before that, works like "Displaced Emperors" and "Re:Positioning Fear" raised the connected question of how culture is generatively "relationship-specific" rather than interactively "site-specific." Music is not the only art that heralds vicissitudes. Other arts, including the electronic arts, do so as well.
