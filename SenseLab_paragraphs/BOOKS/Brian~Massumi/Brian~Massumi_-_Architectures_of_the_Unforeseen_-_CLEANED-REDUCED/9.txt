The risk on the philosophical side is a certain loss of control. As they hatch, the encysted problematic nodes can exert an unexpected pressure on how the conceptual weave evolves. The conceptual tools for their successful texturing are not at the tip of the ventriloquist tongue. Since the initial formulation of the problems is found in the non-philosophical field, bristling with enabling constraints native to that environment, they will carry notional ruguosities that rub the becoming-philosophy in what feels like the wrong way. But the "wrong way" has to be allowed to become relevant, to the limit. This requirement produces more problems. A cascading problematic movement takes hold that sweeps the philosophical writing into turbulent directions it would not have otherwise chosen for itself. The hapless writer finds himself grappling with issues he hadn't anticipated. It is not out of the question that, under the probematic force of the current, he will find himself saying things he never imagined he would say â€“ and perhaps is not even certain he agrees with. But personal belief and ownership of thoughts is not what is at stake. What is at stake is the generation of surprises of thought: the sudden setting into the weave of what was all but unthinkable, finding a foothold for itself in the world where it can exert a force as a goad for further thought and other practices, in follow-on transductions potentially to come.
