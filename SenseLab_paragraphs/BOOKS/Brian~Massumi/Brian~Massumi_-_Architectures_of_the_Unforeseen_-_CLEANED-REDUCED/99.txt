The cheer of becoming, open-ended, challenges architecture at large to review its disciplinary being. This is not a question of revisionism. It is not a question of opposing one version of architectural history to another. The issue is the very manner in which architecture, as a discipline, has a history. Bringing out that issue is the affirmative version of critique (practiced, as always, in passing). Incompletion and continuation are two sides of the same coin. Taking cheer in its own incompletion is a way of topological design reiterating: it continues. Architecture does not only have a history. It has a future. Change ahead.
