In “Re:Positioning Fear,” the stage is set for the cultural act through light projection on a concrete surface. The façade of the building serves as a sensuous surface for word-shadow projection. The projection is technically enabled by a digital apparatus. The abstract surface that is the cultural domain of each act arising through the projection cannot be separated from this actual, concrete, sensuous surface. Neither, however, can the cultural domain be reduced to that sensuous surface, or to the content of what is seen on it. The cultural domain is a bare-active fusion between kinesthesia, vision, and words, among many other levels and registers, occurring through the surface of projection; co-occurring with it in another, nonsensuous, event-dimension. The actual surface – the interface – and the abstract surface of the cultural domain double each other. The one a penumbra to the other’s shadow play. The domain of culture composing the abstract surface "enhances" the cultural act that brings it to determinate expression on the concrete surface. The abstract surface doubles the concrete surface only in order to double over into it. It folds itself into the act's unfolding, in-forming it with more than its determinate figure can hold. It virtually infects it. It fusionally infra-effects it. It populates it with neighboring others, almost-present in processual proximity.
