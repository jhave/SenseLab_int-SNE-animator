This is not an art that starts with the adornment of a concept. The artist is acutely aware that she must beware of being led on by verbal propositions. It is necessary to be wary of words, because the weight of history and the authorized associations they carry predesignate a destination. For the surprise of connection to take – for being in place to take place – one must clear the way for it. Place must be emptied of the meanings already embedded in it. Otherwise, all paths will just lead back to designations that were already in place. To avoid this circular journey, the procedurality of the art process must take the lead. It must do so without the security of an alibi, without a framing concept or already elaborated analysis in place, with studied indifference to known categories.
