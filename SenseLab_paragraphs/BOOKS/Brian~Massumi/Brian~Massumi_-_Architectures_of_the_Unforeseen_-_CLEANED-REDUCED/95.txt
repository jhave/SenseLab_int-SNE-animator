Suppose the shape is earmarked to become a house. But suppose the client doesn’t want to live in the stomach of a highly unforeseen amoeba. Perhaps, for reasons the architect will never comprehend, the client doesn’t figure his life in a geometry of slug love. Say the client wants a house of a certain generic floor-plan. An H-plan, for example. This was the external typological constraint placed on Lynn’s “House Prototype in Long Island” project (1994).xxviii Lynn realized that blobular stretching and fusing, or other too-random form generating procedures, could be limited by addition: by adding another relationality. Blobs were attached to an H-frame made of “splines.” A spline structure is composed of linear segments attached end to end to form a “skeleton.” Unlike a Euclidean line drawing, the spline figure is active. The points of intersection between skeletal segments have virtual strings attached to them. The strings are vectors pulling on each intersection in a different direction, with variable strength. The static figure is in fact a holding pattern formed by a tensile equilibrium between vectorial forces differentially applied through the length of the frame. If you vary the strength of one of the vectors, the influence propagates throughout the entire skeleton. The frame moves like the X-ray of a mime. Although compositionally the spline frame is linear and segmented, the movement that propagates through its structure is continuous and curved. The activation of the tensile relation between linear segments describes a topological transformation. Splining activates a Euclidean figure in a way that generates topological effects.
