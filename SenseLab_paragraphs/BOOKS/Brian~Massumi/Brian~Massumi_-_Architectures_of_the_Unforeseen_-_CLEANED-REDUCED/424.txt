In the artist's home town of Port Dickson is found an oil refinery as well as the largest power station in peninsular Malaysia. There are also ancient cemeteries and shrines. Some of the shrines house rocks. Some rocks, we know, are deities. What makes a rock a deity, the artist asks? What gives power to a rock, and through it, to its place? What draws one in to the power of a place?
