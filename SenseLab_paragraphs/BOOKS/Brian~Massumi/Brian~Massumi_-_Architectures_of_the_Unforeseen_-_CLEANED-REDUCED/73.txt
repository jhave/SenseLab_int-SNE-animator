Another important aside: this urban “force” forces a rethink of “nature.” Nature, from the affirmative perspective, is anything encountered by creative procedure which may be procedurally construed as having been already in operation. Here, “already-operative” is one pole of the base definition of nature. Nature, from this angle, is the also-ran. It is the processual “given”: whatever is “found” by a process under way as evidence of another process having run; whatever is encountered by a process as effectively other than its own; whatever comes to it as from across a dynamic gap; whatever it operatively takes itself to be cut off from and whose operative inclusion must therefore be prepared. The “givenness” of nature is the “anteriority” of other runnings, grasped procedurally from the angle of their actual effects, their literally encountered physical traces (not their metaphysical-metaphorical supplementarity). To return to an earlier point, it is only in this sense of givenness that style and disciplinary tradition are of the “nature” of architecture as practiced. That "nature" naturally extends beyond the given. The forces that have produced the traces consituting nature as given are iterative, and through their repetition are apt to produce novelties of effect that go beyond the given. This is the other pole of "nature," included in the very definition of force: the tendency to surpass the given, in new, emergent forms.xiii The architectural process, as operating in an open field not bounded by its disciplinarity, enthusiastically takes up "nature" from this angle. Its own "cultural" activities are but this "nature," furthered.xiv
