The artist doesn't dwell on the idea of demolition, or think in terms of deconstruction. Demolition is just a procedure for conditioning the site for the arising of an emergent effect. She thinks of it in terms of peeling an orange to make the juices flow. She will peel the pavilion to extract its relational juices from the contributing places so that they flow together in a liquid refraction nonspecific to this place, but singularly taking place here. Making to place is making taking-place. It is making the exhibition of the art an event â€“ even if little or nothing happens by the usual criteria of what an event is. The kind of event that is conditioned to take place is an emergent effect of the liquid refraction, like a rainbow forming between raindrops. That is what the things that have been brought together in the exhibition are. Not sited objects: placedrops. Which makes the small epiphanies that may form between them lifebows.
