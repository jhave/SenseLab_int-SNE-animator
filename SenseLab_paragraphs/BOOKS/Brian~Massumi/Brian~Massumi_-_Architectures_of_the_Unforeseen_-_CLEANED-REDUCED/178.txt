Rather than an add-on, the decorative effect is an integral overexpresson of the intensity of the relationality of the figure's matrixial genesis. If it "adds" anything, it is an overtone unfolding from the same in-folding constitutive of the figure as a whole. The decorative dimension is an extra-effect of the figure's integral expression. What it highlights is the sense of the abstract surface's doubling of the concrete surface. It brings the figure's taking-off from its concretre conditions out further, abstractly extending the abstract surface into the space surrounding the concrete surface deployment of form. In a word, it adds "atmosphere": an affective expression expressing the expressiveness of the abstract surface, at once immanent to it and emanating from it. Affective atmosphere is what Walter Benjamin would call an "aura," or what Whitehead would call an "affective tonality."lxxx It extends the expressed interfusion of the elements into a perfusion of the surrounding space. It is an aesthetic extra-effect, an affective emanation that some call beauty. It is not reducible to form, but rather adds to it an epistratum. It epistratically diffuses the intensity of the process of the emergence of form into the surrounding space. This adjoins to the concretized form an atmospheric associated milieu whose appearance is at once purely perceptual (an abstract surface) and at the same time inhabitable (spatializing; affectively-aesthetically diffusing into a milieu that can be moved through).
