The cultural act was described as a two-way movement. In one direction, it rejoined its potential for change, at an infraindividual level. Following this movement, cultural specificities – place, memories of the past and toward the future, generally shared affective orientations, language-borne behavioral and ideational tendencies of an effectively ideological nature, acquired competencies and habits – are placed in expressive suspense. This is an active suspense in which they are poised to return, under variation. In the tensed suspense of the infra-moment, their determinations "fuse" together, and their fusing together mates with levels and scales beyond the measured human pale. That is to say, they enter a domain of immediate proximity across their differences in an expanded field: they resonate. In resonant intensity, they modulate each other's potential next expression. When the next act comes, its course will have been infected, inflected, in-formed by the cross-mating of levels enveloped in words, in a region of language coming to clear expression. "Priming" was given as an example of this mutational-relational co-effecting of a coming act, immanent to its eventful emergence.
