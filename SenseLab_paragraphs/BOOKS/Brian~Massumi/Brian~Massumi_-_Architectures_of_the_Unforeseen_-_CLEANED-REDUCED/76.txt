Intensely prepared as a spatial dissolve, the screen is now ready. All it needs for something to come to pass â€“ is something to come to pass. Throw an abstract object into the openness of the force-field. Something happens. What has been proto-formally prepared is an event. Throw in a spherical particle assigned a certain mass: it will move. The tension of the field plays out as movement. Intensity, in the event, translates extensively as movement. The particle will waft from basin to basin, sometimes hesitating at the thresholds between. In most cases, it will end up being captured by the strongest basin of attraction and fall into entropic quiescence.
