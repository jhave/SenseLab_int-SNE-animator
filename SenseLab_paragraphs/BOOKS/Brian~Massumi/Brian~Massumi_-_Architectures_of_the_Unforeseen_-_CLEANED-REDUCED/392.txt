Gossip is much maligned. It is commonly denounced both as threat to privacy and as a degradation of public discourse. But who are "they" who can convincingly say they viscerally prefer a well-sourced news report to the latest gossip? Despite the tendency to stereotyping inherent in gossip's collapse of type and individual into each other and in the normative accent that often accompanies the gossipy evaluations of the virtual "they," gossip is simply more socially alive than Walter Cronkite ever was. It brings us back to the sociable place where "utterance crosses utterance" and words react with gleefully irresponsible abandon on other words.
