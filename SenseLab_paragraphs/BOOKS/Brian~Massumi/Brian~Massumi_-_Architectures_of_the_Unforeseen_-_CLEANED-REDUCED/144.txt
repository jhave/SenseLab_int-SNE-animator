The stadium-wave occurs at the limit of the physical body, where a dynamic form detaches from the outline of the individual body and is directly actualized on an abstract surface. The materiality proper to the hands, flesh and blood, doubles the affective matter of the event, on another level. As Bergson noted, "the surface film of the body that constitutes the visible body is apt to double itself, one of the two copies remaining with the tactile body. But the fact remains that there is a body that is detachable from the body that one can touch, a body without interiority, weightless, and that is transported instantaneously to the point where it is."li Bergson was talking about the reflection of the unitary body in a pool. Here, a crowd of touchable, gesturing physical bodies double themselves en masse. An abstract double detaches from one and all, instantaneously transported into a fusional multiplicity that is directly seen, as the affective matter-of-fact of the event, appearing right where it is – effectively all over, globally distributed – as a weightless abstract surface without interiority, affectively felt through the eyes without being touched (or touchable). "Our body," William James writes in a related comment, "is the palmary instance of the ambiguous. … We can treat it as physical or as non-physical according as we take it in the narrower or in the wider context." lii The body is "ambiguous" because it is two-sided: physical (touchable) and non-physical or abstract (untouchable, if still feelable); individual (proto-wavers) and collective (wave-effect); narrower and wider; elemental and integral; several and fused; given bodies (giving their activity to the wave) and a becoming-body (taking that distributed activity into itself, where it is).
