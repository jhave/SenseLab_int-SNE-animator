It cannot be said enough: interactivity is not where relational architecture essentially lives. Relational architecture is not an interactive art. It is precisely what it says it is: a relational art. It should be taken at its word. The sensuous, actually appearing interactive response of the physiological body is just the tip of the occurrent iceberg. It is the manner of the event through which the open relational field in which relational architecture essentially lives comes to a surface clarity of expression. The event, as a cultural act, comes through the interaction, in which it peaks. The event is not the interactive response per se, but rather the manner in which the field of culturability has been folded into it, to effect a selective recomposition of a cultural domain.
