In Whitehead’s words, the direct hit, or “presentational immediacy,” of a word “precipitates feelings” which “enhance” – add a modulation to – the event taking place.xv Peirce calls these precipitate feelings the “material quality” of the experience: feeling in motion, at the “first beginning of a cognition.”xvi “Corresponding to every feeling within us,” Peirce observes, “some motion takes place in our bodies.”xvii The inaugural feeling-motion is pluripotent. In its qualitative aspect, it is the suchness of the experience: its affecive tonality (“how it feels"xviii). The quality is “material” in an energetic sense: a suchness stirring toward an issue in action and perception. Just now, in this very “first beginning” of the experience coming, it has yet to go anywhere or do anything definite. The material suchness of the feeling-motion is the “substance,” or “immediate object,” of the nascent experience.xix Its substantive stirring-toward makes it the sign of the coming action-perception. Whose occurrence it helps effect. Affect. Inflect. Strange emotional-volitional “substance,” this. It would be better to call it an "element," with something of the sense we give the word when we use the phrase "the elements" to refer to weather: a sense of qualitatively changing conditions that are unmistakeably material but lack the separate thingness we associate with substance. Like the weather, there is an elusiveness to the material quality of nascent experience, even in the insistence of its stirring-toward. The sign’s passing into action-perception unawares, in the just-before of the coming experience, gives its inaugural effectiveness the abstractness of a thought. The material quality of the dawning event is indissociably a thought and a sign: a thought-sign.xx The thought-sign as material quality: the body in its element.
