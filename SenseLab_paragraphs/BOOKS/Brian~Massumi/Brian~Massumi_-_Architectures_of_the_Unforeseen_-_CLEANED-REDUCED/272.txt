It is often asked whether digitally-assisted art combining a number of media is itself a medium. Is the medium of Lozano-Hemmer’s work architecture? Writing? The phenomenal body? “The digital”? “The electronic?” Light? Movement? Silicon? The work involves all of these, but is not couched intimately or exclusively enough in any of them to qualify one as “the” medium. Does this mean that this kind of work is a simple hybrid, a messy catch-all of media? The all-over-the-place eclecticism this implies is not at all in evidence in Lozano-Hemmer’s projects, which manage to produce highly unified aesthetic effect by very mixed means.
