She realizes that it is not likely to work that way. The ground of the artspace and the ground of the outback are not the same, nor are the sidewalks of Sydney, Port Dickson and Venice. This means that the conditions for an effectively intensifying rising of a refractive background signaling its contrast to ground are different in every case. What happens in each case is less site-specific than relationship-specific. You have to start from prior relation to remake relation. There are conventionalized, identified, labelled relations already everywhere embedded in place. This is no less true – in some ways perhaps even more true – of art sites. These existing conditions of embedded relation fixed in place are what must be cleared away, to make way for triggering otherwise. Although the emergently triggered relation is not reducible to the ground of its triggering, and is not effectively contained in the definition of the site, every detail of the site, the smallest characteristic of the lay of the land, can become a contributing factor to the emergence that happens in the clearing. Or, it can become a contributing factor to a swerve back into the "about," with all the identifying and categorizing and assumed overlay of meanings and officialized versionings of history that come with that. The lay of the land must be taken account of. To dump is not enough. The lay of that land must be grappled with.
