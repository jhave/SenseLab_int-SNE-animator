Gossip is the genre of speech that from time immemorial has stealthily re-insinuated the tangled web of third-party lines into whatever sphere or technology of communication was available. Every piece of gossip purports to be a direct report of something specific said by a particular other. Its citational practice, however, is sloppy, to say the least. You never quite know if the "he said x" is in fact a "she said he said x." Or even a "he said she said he said x." You never know how far down the line the utterance has actually come. The "owner" of the speech reported is essentially vague. Because of this, what is ostensibly a "private" exchange between two parties is on a party-line. Not only is there is a cited third speaker necessarily involved, because the statement presents itself as a report of another's utterance, there is the distinct possibility of a fourth person in line, behind what the reported-upon third person is reported to have said. Gossip is actually in the fourth person singular.lxii
