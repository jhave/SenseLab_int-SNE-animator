Soon after her arrival in Australia, she begins a practice that will continue throughout her artistic life. As she makes her way through the city, she keeps an eye out for "naughts": discarded little things in the shape of a zero, like the plastic ring from a soda bottle top. Little zeros: the shape of emptiness. They lie where they are found because they have come to naught, from where no one cares, discarded. They have been emptied from an anonymous passerby's quotidian cargo. Dumped, without so much as a passing thought. As litter, the place they occupy is tenuous. They have no claim to place other than the unadorned fact that this is where they happen to be, for no good reason. This is not the same as being out of place. It is being in a place without an alibi.
