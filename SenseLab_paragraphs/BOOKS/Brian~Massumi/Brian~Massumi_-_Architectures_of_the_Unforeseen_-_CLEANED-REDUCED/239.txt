The kinesthetic amoeba is the reality of the body’s performative, reformative folding into the stretch of its potential. The word relation is better for this than connection. The kinesthetic amoeba is the body’s relation to its own potential’s performative playing-out: dynamic self-relation, in it for the stretch. The specific connections the body enters into selectively express the ongoing of potential, enveloped in the determinate shape of a taken step. With each move, the body’s self-relation extends itself down its path through the world. The dynamic self-relation is, in addition, at same time and in the same act, a relation of the body’s potential to its extensive expression, pseudopodically afoot in the world. No “mere” here. If anything, a doubly real: relation of relation. Integral self-relation extending into relations between discrete steps in a performative, reformative world of proliferating paths.
