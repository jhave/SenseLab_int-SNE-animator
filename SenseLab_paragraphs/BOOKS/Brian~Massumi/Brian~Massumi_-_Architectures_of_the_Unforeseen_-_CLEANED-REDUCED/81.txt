If the process is rhythmic, then in order to double it technologies of the virtual must be iterative in their procedure. To iterate is precisely what the virtually-inclined architect does in design practice: tweak and repeat. Change parameters and re-run. Reassign mass, vary the topology of the field, and see what happens. Tweak and see: technologies of the virtual are experimental practices.
