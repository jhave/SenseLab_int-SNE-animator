The artist has a vocabulary for talking about the enabling conditions for refracting places in this way. She refers to a certain loosening of ties to the real, by which she says she means undoing the accepted sense of the "right" way to be in the world. This loosening of accepted ties is a mode of extraction from place. The extraction segues into a mode of abstraction. The non-site specificity of art-making to place is by nature an abstraction from place. It necessitates a loosening of ties to the consensual "reality" in place.
