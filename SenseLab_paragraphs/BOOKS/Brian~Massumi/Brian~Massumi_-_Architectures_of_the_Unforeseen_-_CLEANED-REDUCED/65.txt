Generic process: where topology rather than standard typology is key, conventions of style is as incidental as the computer tool. It is anterior only in the sense that it comes to the design practice as a found object. Style is an incidental or outside element of the architectural design process – unless and until it is mutually included in its ongoing, as one growth factor among others. The architect does not operate from within the tradition but in continual re-encounter with it. The architect is not in the tradition: she is in the world. The worldly design re-encounter is not a dialectical interaction at a signifying remove. It is an unmediated fusional event, sweeping all sides up in the same effective transformation; the same unbounded, unclassified becoming; the same ‘uncritical’ or participatory, proliferative differentiation.xi Architecture’s tradition occurs to it, indistinctly, like its deferred identity (in fact, the perpetual re-encounter with tradition, in the generic, is its deferred identity). Rather than a dialectic without synthesis: an addition without a sum. That might do nicely as the motto for an affirmative architecture.
