This means that the individualism of self-interest also has no foundational role, despite Hume's own attempt to save it. At any rate, Hume doesn't seem convinced by his own argument that preferring pleasure over pain is an incontrovertible "natural sentiment" and that the approbation of others is naturally a pleasure, and that together they block any ungrounding approach to the regressive limit of the dividual, thus exorcising the possibility that out of the complex and uncertain oscillatory process of which the dividual is the inmost endpoint a decision might make itself that by the conventions of society would fall to an unacceptable extreme: either the callous extreme of preferring the destruction of the whole world to a slight discomfort of a little digit, or the opposite extreme of choosing my own total ruin to the slightest discomfort of a person on the other side of world who is totally unknown to me. Untempered by self-interest, sympathy would seem to move us naturally in the latter direction. In its own processual terms, there is no reason why a contagion of feeling of the kind Hume theorizes would not issue in actions expressing a preference for someone else's well-being over my own. With reason unable to give a motivation for why this should not be the case, the field would seem to be affectively weighted at least as much in this direction as toward callous disregard.
