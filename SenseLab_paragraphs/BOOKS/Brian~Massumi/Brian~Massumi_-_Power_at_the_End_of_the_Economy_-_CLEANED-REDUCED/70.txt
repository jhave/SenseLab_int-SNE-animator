What all of this means is that priming works with the dividual. Its mode of operation presupposes a tendential undertow in the life of the individual that is best approached affirmatively, and whose complexity is such that only a certain ratio of success can be guaranteed. The tendential undertow crests into determinate action, and this process can be modulated by the implantation of presuppositional postures and the activation of associated tendencies. The mechanisms for inflecting outcomes must be affirmative of the dividual, and operate in AN OPEN RELATIONAL FIELD. Relative consistency of results is attained by triggering a subset of activity in the environment. This SPECIAL ACTIVITY is set off against the surrounding activity in the open field, without being divided from it by a strict dividing line. It is focalized, without being segregated. The ongoing activity in the environment is less excluded than it is backgrounded. Priming is an art of situational emphasis. In keeping with its affirmative modus operandi, it functions by incitation or triggering, rather than punishment and reward. It induces PARTICIPATION, rather than imposing a form. It brings something to life in the situation, rather than carving away at life to make it conform to a mold. PRIMING IS AN INDUCTIVE MODE OF POWER. It induces. It allows things to come out, rather than battening them down. It brings to be, rather than making conform. It effects, rather than negate. In a word, priming is a mechanism of ONTOPOWER.
