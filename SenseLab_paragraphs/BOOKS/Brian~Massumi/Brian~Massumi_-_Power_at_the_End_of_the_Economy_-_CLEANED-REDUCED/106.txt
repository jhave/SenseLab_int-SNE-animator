All of this has occurred not on the individual level, but in-the-dividual. The autonomy of decision that expressed itself in your action-path effectively has a WILL. More precisely, it IS a will: its autonomy is a willing willing itself to occur in the local arena of a situated subfield of the overall field of life, uncertainly oscillating between the poles of the dividual and the transindividual. HERE, AFFECTIVE INVOLVEMENT IS THE FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENT OF WILL. Affectivity and will are in a zone of indistinction—which includes aspects which would be considered eminently rational were they separable from the zone of indistinction with affectivity, in its functional equivalence with will. But they did not occur separately. The "RATIONAL" ASPECTS of the event – judgment,  hypothesis, comparative evaluation of alternatives, decision—were mutually included in the event along with all they other co-operating factors. In the event, they came as perceptual judgment, abductively thought-felt hypothesis: tendential auto-evaluation. Decision inseparable from the embodied fact of movement. The rational aspects came FUSED INTO the singular complex that was the playing-out of this event. Because of the effective dominance of the aspect of affective involvement, the fusional complex can be qualified overall as affective. But it is in fact more an EVENT COMPLEXION: a complex of co-composing factors, including ones we may categorize as rational.23 You can think of the event's complexion as its unfolding's immanent oscillation between all of its contributory factors, already resolving into an action path in a interval smaller than the smallest perceivable: in the infra-instant of bare activity, turning out; in a regression to the inmost end, turning instantly about.
