Returning to Luhmann's analytic of trust, to say that trust and distrust resonate together in a zone of indistinction of immediate oscillatory proximity to each other means that what is felt in the lead-up to an economic act, as it is brinking, is neither one nor the other, neither trust nor distrust. Luhmann says that what is felt is a "readiness" to feel either come next (Luhmann 1979, 79). The individual is in an infra-state of READINESS POTENTIAL. Trust and distrust are together as co-present potentials for what might come next. They are in SUPERPOSITION, in the sense in which the word is used in quantum physics. Though inseparable, their distinction is not erased. It is held in ready reserve.
