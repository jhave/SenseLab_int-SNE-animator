Rationality is in no way the opposite of affect or emotion. As Pixley remarked, rationality positively requires emotion. Rational choice only works if it arbitrarily surrenders itself to an autonomy of decision that is one with an affective willing. Ratiocination chews its cud. Affect cuts to the quick. In the final analysis, this makes the outcome of every event an affective fact.
