In the experiments presented above, choice-blindness was the result of one form of priming. The priming consisted in withholding cues that would have signaled a change in the situation, while implanting presuppositions through the form of encounter of the exercise, which placed participants in a certain posture and activated tendencies favoring the "conformation of feeling" between the two tastings. In this experiment, as in the deliberation-without-attention experiment, participants were postured as subjects of interest called upon to exercise rational choice. The result varied, depending on the complexity of the consumer choice. The least complex choice was generally accomplished with nothing untoward happening to call the cogitational consumer prowess of the subjects into question. Deliberative rational choice, however, collapsed with the complex, higher-stakes choice. Participants who used their gut feelings to decide made better economic decisions by standard measures, and even aside from the question of cost effectiveness obtained greater satisfaction from the choice. These participants were obliged to make their choices while distracted (Dijksterhuis et al. 2006). With deliberative cogitation thus disenabled by the setup of the situation, the field was open for intuition to play a dominant role. Intuition took control of the situation.
