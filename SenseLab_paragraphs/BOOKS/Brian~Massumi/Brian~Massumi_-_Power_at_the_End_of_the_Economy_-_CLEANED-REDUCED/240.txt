Aesthetic Politics 
I think that advocating affective politics is advocating aesthetic politics. I think about the connection between affective politics and aesthetic politics in terms of Whitehead’s idea of “contrast.” Contrasts are tendential unfoldings that are held together in the same situation. They are alternate headings that come together in the instant, even though their actual unfoldings are mutually exclusive. Their mutual exclusiveness is a kind of creative tension: an intensity. The  contrasts between headings interfere and resonate, and this commotion modulates what may come. Whitehead defines the aesthetic in terms of this intensity of contrasts. The aesthetic act extends the creative tension of contrast that characterizes the emergence of every action. It prolongs the suspension of the cut, the commotion of interference and resonance, gives it duration, so that it passes the threshold of perceptibility and is consciously felt as potential. This prevents the heading from being an automatic feedforward to the end, like a reflex response to a stimulus. Resolution is suspended. The termini in play remain virtual ends. Their mutual exclusivity is still informing the situation, contributing to what it might be, but the tension doesn’t have to resolve itself to be consciously felt and thought. Aesthetic politics is irresolute. It is commotional. It’s the thinking-feeling of the virtual incompletion of definitive action.
