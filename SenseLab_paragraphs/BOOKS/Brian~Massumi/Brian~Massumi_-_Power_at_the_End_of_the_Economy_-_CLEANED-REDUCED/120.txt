Now, back to the paddock. Add a frisbee to the bull. We can be the wind. We can throw the bull a curve. I mean, we can throw it a gesture that inflects its course, just as a gust inflects the path of the frisbee. Make the bull gaseous. Wind it onto another path.
When the field of potential arose with the dawning of the event, it did not just include paths of escape. It also included potential gestures that might immediatly modulate the relation between you, the intruding field perturber, and the territorial bull. If performed with just the right accent, a RELATIONAL GESTURE of that kind can alter the complex of action-paths coming into force. A potential line of escape might appear that wouldn't otherwise have been activated. Thus in the heat of the event, a potential is coined. It is INVENTED, not as an independent variable extracted from the event: as an immanent point-modulation of the integral field. A differential path deviation appears out of nowhere. Or rather, it punctually emerges out of the full-spectrum complexity of the event. The change in the field of potential takes effect as a function of how all the elements have happened to come together toward the coming event, but it was triggered by one factor among them. A punctual gesture CATALYZES a modulation of the whole of the field of action-potential. The gesture would come to nothing if it did not factor into its own performance the potential of the event in all of its contributing factors. It works by finessing the way they come together. Even an almost imperceptible tweak, a slight turning of the eyes or subtle change in posture, can pivot the bullish relational field around itself, catalyzing it into a change of state.
