Once again, the basic mechanism of this modulation is priming, of which there are many forms. All involve conditioning the situation, addressing the putative subject of interest from the angle of its constitutive openness to its own outside: from the angle of its relational sensitivities across scales, at the point where the feedback and feedforward between the dividual and the transindividual cross at what is experienced as the individual level. At that micro-level, priming works positively to induce emergent effects through cueing (or the lack thereof). Situational cues implant presuppositions and activate dividual tendencies. The presuppositional seeding of the field modifies the relative force of the multiple tendencies that are always churning on the infra-level, weighting the decision that is coming in certain directions, toward emergent determinations. The leveraging of effect by priming is inciting and orienting, rather than disciplining and punishing. It is inductive, a "POSITIVE" POWER in the sense in which Foucault uses the term. Conscious cogitation can always enter into the equation at this nodal point, but is never fully determining. It is the oscillatory process as a whole, as nodally modulated, that ultimately decides. All factors, including conscious cogitation, are CO-FACTORS in what always amounts to an exercise of processual autonomy producing complexly correlated subjective and systemic effects.
