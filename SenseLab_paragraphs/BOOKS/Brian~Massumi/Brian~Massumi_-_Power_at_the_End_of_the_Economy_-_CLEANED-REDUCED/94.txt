The discussion of decision-without-attention and choice-blindness added an essential dimension to this portrait of the neoliberal field of machinic life: the fact that punctual mechanisms of modulation can intervene at the nodal point where tendential infra-individual complexity of the dividual and the transindividual complexity intersectâ€”where the subject of interest experiences its I, in a conscious registering of the force of the movements passing through it. At this intersection, decisional effect can be strategically leveraged. The cut can be modulated locally, as well as dispersively (as through the internet and mobile communications).
