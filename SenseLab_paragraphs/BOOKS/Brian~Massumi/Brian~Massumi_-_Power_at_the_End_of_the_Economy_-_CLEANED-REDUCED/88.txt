Under conditions of irreducible complexity where a range of potential differences are mutually included in each oscillatory point at every moment, it is precisely the autonomous cut of the EVENT of decision that makes something determinate come to pass, and come to be. The theorist who invented the concept of human capital, T. W. Schultz, proposed "an all-inclusive concept of technology" that would include "the innate abilities of man" (Schultz 1971, 10). Homo oeconomicus, Foucault agrees, is more appropriately classified as a live-wire technology than a biological species. Innately, it is an "ABSTRACT MACHINE" (Deleuze and Guattari 1987). Abstract, because the oscillatory point at which its abilities come through to decisive effect is a superposition of differences too overdetermined to be a specifically this or that as yet, in actually determined fact. The subject of choice is an abstract machine exactly at the point at which, and to the precise extent to which, it is a decider of complexity: it is an orderer out of quasi-chaotic intensity, in convergent co-operation with what eludes its calculations.
