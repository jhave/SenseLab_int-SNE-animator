This is precisely what both experiments did. They generated their surprise results against the backdrop of the implicit assumption of rational choice. In both cases, the experimental subjects were required to justify their choices. What an odd request, to justify a taste. In everyday life, your response to the question "milk or sugar?" is rarely answered with "why?" The imperative to be rational about a matter of taste is likely to have distracted the subjects from their powers of deliberation-without-attention with which matters of taste are habitually approached. Interference was produced between the playing-out of the tendencies with which the most basic sensory experience is laden, and the duty to cogitate as if our perceptions were somehow fundamentally neutral and we stand back from our own tasting to hold it in judgment. As if the value of the tasting, its satisfactoriness, were separable from its occurrence, and the full-spectrum experiential IMMEDIACY OF THAT EVENT. In the consumer choice experiment, participants' powers of deliberation-without-attention were activated by complexity in the problem posed by the high-cost item of the car. The experimental setup invited, by admitting complexity into the situation as an active factor, tripping into action an autonomous decisionmaking power deciding through the experimental subjects. This "surprisingly" demonstrated the limits of consciously deliberative rational choice: it only works well under conditions of simplicity, in this case (as in most) coinciding with A LOWERING OF THE STAKES.
