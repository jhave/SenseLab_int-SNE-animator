The irreducibility of "physical intuition" to the cognitive category of inference or the application of rules is well understood by anyone (or even anyone's dog) who has played frisbee. The flight of the frisbee is oriented, but subject to modulation on the fly by irreducibly complex playing-out of atmospheric conditions: in a word, the wind. The complexity of the dynamics of frisbee flight are already so complex that a rule-based calculation of the curve of the frisbee's path, even without unexpected affections of the wind, can only be accomplished by calculus (Lynn 1999, 23-25). And yet I, and your average dog, neither of whom has studied calculus, can catch it more often than not. We catch as if we had carried out a complex operation of calculus. And not only that, we instantaneously correct for perturbations occurring en route. This requires an amendment to the earlier statement that "multi-step" arithmetic operations can be performed nonconsciously. The multistep operations are not performed in multiple steps. They are performed in one go, as if they had come consecutivelyâ€”but, as it happens, fused into a perceptual  judgment. Perceptual judgement is capable of packing the multiple into the dynamic unity of an occurrence.
