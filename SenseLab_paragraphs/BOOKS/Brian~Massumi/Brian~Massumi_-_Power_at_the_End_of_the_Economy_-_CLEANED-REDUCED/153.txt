If joy must be distinguished from pleasure and satisfaction, and divorced from taste, it must also be saved from a final indignity: being mistaken for INSTANT GRATIFICATION. It is true that instant gratification is an activity that is entered into for its own sake, and is self-affirming. But it is consuming, not creative. But it is really is just one half of neoliberalism's paradoxes of self-interested satisfaction. Instant gratification (get it while you can, before the next crisis wipes you out) and the deferral of satisfaction (the "rational" calculus that it would be wiser in the long run to defer gratification) are two sides of the same neoliberal coin. They are an INFERNAL ALTERNATIVE: the "choice" between them binds you to the presupposition that you are effectively a subject of interest, whichever way you choose to go.37 It binds you to the hedonic dynamic of life, in its neoliberal expression, and as such is catastrophic from the point of view of the intensification of existence. Satisfaction, associated with consumption, is DEINTENSIFYING. Instead of holding the contrariety of contrasts in tension, it suspends the tensionâ€”thus losing the contrasts. It relieves tension, stilling tendency in a moment of entropic equilibrium that seems to offer succor in the oscillating seas of the stormy economic field of relation. Consumptive satisfaction is the ANTI-AESTHETIC OF CAPITALISM.
