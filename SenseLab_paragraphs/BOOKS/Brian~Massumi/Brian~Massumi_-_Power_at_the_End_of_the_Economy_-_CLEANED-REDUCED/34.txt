Individual economic actors are infra-connected. They are connected at a distance, in the recesses of their affective rabbit-holes. They communicate at a distance, in immanent affective proximity, churning in and turning around the regressive endpoints of their respective (in)dividualities. THE INFRA-LEVEL RESONATES TRANSINDIVIDUALLY. Individuals spook each other or goad each other on, turning around what is nontransferable in them as individuals: their infra-individual affective commotion. They resonate, at the limit of the economy, in their dividuality. As they reciprocally perturb each other, their readiness-potential wave-packet collapses, correlated transindividually at a distance. Quanta of trust and distrust fly off in all directions. These affective emissions feed up into macro-level expressions of economic success or failure, which no sooner feed back down from the systems macro level into the affective infra-fray.
