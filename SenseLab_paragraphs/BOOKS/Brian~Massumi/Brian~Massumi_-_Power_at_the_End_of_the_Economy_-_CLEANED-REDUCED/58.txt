Returning to the question of the individual actor's relation to itself, there has been a tectonic shift in experimental psychology as it has become increasingly preoccupied over the last ten to fifteen years with poking its empirical stick at the rabbit-hole of affect. Nonconsciousness studies has become a growth field in all areas, but most troubling for many in the key areas of decision and choice. Most recently, rational choice theory has had to contend with the emerging domain of "CHOICE BLINDNESS" theory, CB for short. In the science of choice, a ground-shaking acronymic shift is occurring from REM (rational economic man) to CB. The challenge is not only to the trustability of one's choices under conditions of extreme uncertainty. It reaches into the smallest recesses of the most everyday of situationsâ€”and ascends to the supposedly rock-solid heights of the individual's moral compass.
