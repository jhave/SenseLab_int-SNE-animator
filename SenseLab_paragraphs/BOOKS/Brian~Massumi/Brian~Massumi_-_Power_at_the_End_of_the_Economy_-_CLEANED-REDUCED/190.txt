The rallying cry is always "FREEDOM." Freedom, as we saw earlier, is not owned as right, it is not consumed as a good, it is not chosen as an option: it is what is invented. The amplification of the germinal affection-event into a crisis—a whole-field oscillation poised to cross the threshold to a new consistency—makes the field of relation INTENSELY PROBLEMATIC. It urgently re-poses the problem of freedom, requiring the invention of a new solution: A NEW MODE OF FREEDOM. The solution can only come from a FABULATORY PLAYING out of the tendencies actuated by the strike of the sign of the other's affection. In the sudden uncertainty of the field, these tendencies are of many kinds—including counter-tendencies that reenergize, or passionately invent themselves on the spot, in an instantaneous TRANSITION IN PLACE. If a counter-tendency takes the ascendance, regime-change, or even revolution, may ensue. What began as a GERMINAL MICRO-EVENT, has then amplified into THE MOST FAR-REACHING MACRO-POLITICAL CHANGE imaginable.
