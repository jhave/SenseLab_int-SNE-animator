Foucault highlights the key points. The subject of interest, he says, is "DOUBLY INVOLUNTARY" (Foucault 2008, 277). "The individual's enjoyment is linked to a course of the world that outstrips him and eludes him in every respect" (277). Each individual is "dependent on an uncontrollable, unspecified whole of the flow of things and the world" in which "the most distant event taking place on the other side of the world may affect my interest, and there is nothing I can do about it" (277; emphasis added). "Economic man," Foucault coninues, is situated in what we would call an indefinite field of immanence which links him, in the form of dependence, to a series of accidents [Involuntary No. 1: perturbations striking the dividual; emergent trust/distrust effects], and, on the other hand, links him, in the form of production, to the advantage of others [Involuntary No. 2: amplification; multiplier effects registering success/failure]  … The convergence of interest thus doubles and covers the indefinite diversity of accidents … so we have a system in which homo oeconomicus owes the positive nature of his calculation precisely to what eludes his calculation (277-78).
