"Given the conditions": it is paramount to remember that THE CONDITIONS INCLUDE SINGULARITy. The affection-event trigger in Tunis was utterly singular, to the point that it has a proper name: Mohamed Bouazizi. Bouazizi's singular act of self-immolation was explosive by virtue of the lay of the relational land in Tunisia, implanted as it was, and as is always the case, with an ensemble of presuppositions and tendencies that are utterly unique. Every event has its own affective complexion. For Occupy Wall Street, it was a signature composition of signs, including the economic trope of the "1% percent," the couterpowerful prestige of the Anonymous brand, and the mischievously symbolic leer of the Guy Fawkes mask. The cascade of affective events occurs through a multiplier effect, not unlike the kinds of multiplier effects that neoliberalism vaunts. The difference is that COUNTERPOWER CONTAGIONS MULTIPLY THE SINGULARITY OF SERIALLY LINKED EVENTS.
