Conveyed with the affection, mutually included in its vivacity, are incipient actions and buds of tendency. THE SIGN OF THE OTHER ACTUATES THESE. Your passion is the movement of their actuation. You are braced into a complexity of unresolved contrasts and alternate outcomes, all intensely thought-felt flush with the perception. The vitality affect of the event is the registering of this complexity, as exceeding any particular pole of contrast, contrastive pair, or determinate outcome. The multiplicity of modes of activity, further multiplied by the co-presenting of alternate runnings of each, produces an untenable tension. The tension is the churning of the dividual, in bare activity. Only an issue in action will resolve the tension. Only one action can effectively unfold. This NEED FOR A REDUCTION OF THE AFFECTIVE WAVE-PACKET itself produces an additional tension: between the bracingness of the instant and the future resolution, in the course of which the experience will be determined to distance itself from the germinal vivacity of its overfullness with contrast, incipiency, and tendency, as well as the vaguely but vitally sensed possibility of the invention of new passions and their attendant tendencies.
