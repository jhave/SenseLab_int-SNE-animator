Now take all of these considerations, subtract the bull, move into a different kind of situation implanted with presuppositions we would tend to call political. What would POLITICAL FABULATION Think-feel like? What gestures might catalyze a whole-field change of state? Answer that question, and you have intuition as a political art of the event. 
One thing is clear: such an art of politics would not be grouded in the personal freedom of choice of the individual subject of interest. Rather, it would pivot around the relational fabulation of affective facts. It would register that FREEDOM IS NOT CHOSEN: IT IS INVENTED. It is inventedâ€”in a way that is not easily distinguishable from a discovery.
