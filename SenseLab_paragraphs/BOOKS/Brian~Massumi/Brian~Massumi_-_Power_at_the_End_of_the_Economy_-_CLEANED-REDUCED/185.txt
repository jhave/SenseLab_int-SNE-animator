The distance doesn't have to be geographical. It could be between conventional categories of belonging—age, class, gender, religion, species—separated from each other by a social gulf sinking gaps of remoteness into proximity. The communication of affection at the heart of the sympathetic event is by transindividual nature NONLOCAL. It can reverberate across the relational field, faster than the speed of conscious calculation. It is as double-involuntarily contagious as a sneeze or a maniacal laugh. It can skip causal intermediaries, and pop up somewhere else, in no time flat. Or, its taking-effect can be SUSPENDED, because SIGNS CAN BE ARCHIVED. This suspension is not the same as a deferral. The event is suspended in the sign's readiness potential—the semiotic equivalent of bare activity. This is not a mediation. It is an archiving of affective immediacy. The time of the affective event's taking-effect is no more linear in time than its moving-relation is in space. It is only answerable to its own rhythm, which emerges as a whole-field effect from the way in which the relational field has been primed and conditioned. The affective event is not site-specific. It is WHOLE-FIELD-RELATION-SPECIFIC. It is not pinnable to a particular place—yet it effectively TAKES PLACE. Neither is it pinpointable in clocktime—even though the emission of its triggering sign is as punctual as the chiming of a clock. Its punctuality it that of a flashpoint: an explosion, an instantaneous amplification, sending out wave upon wave of impulse, such that it MAKES AND TAKES ITS OWN TIME. The sympathetic event occurs in different dimension to metric time and space: the pulsed time of the bare-activity, churning and turning around with nonlinear readiness potential.
