This is an eminently pragmatic undertaking. It involves experimenting with PRACTICES OF EVENT-CONDITIONING. What kind of perceptual judgments produce an expanding landscape of potential? How can presuppositions be eventfully implanted in the relational field to tend it for intensification? What compositions of signs of the passion of the other are apt to induce a sympathetic event of singular-multiple contagion, beyond the human pale of self-interest? What kinds of primings lend themselves to the emergence of contrastive compossibilities? How can relations be moved in such as way as to give rise to new passions? And the new passions to new tendencies? And the new tendencies to the invention of new settlements that do not, too quickly or too harshly, relimit the potential released? How can these settlements be so constituted as to desire their own surpassing, in a next freedom-of-the-event in an ongoing series, contagiously overcoming the containments into which each event in the series inevitably subsides? How can all of this be accomplished abductively, in the immediacy of the event? How can the affective nonconscious be politically operationalized, without fostering a fascism? How do you orient the political art of intuition toward the serial reinvention of freedom? How do you learn to self-prime in this direction, in cross-sensitive collaboration with the primings at large in the relational field, given the limits of reflective reason? In short, how do you MACHINE TRANSINDIVIDUAL AUTONOMIES OF DECISION, given their â€¦ autonomy? And in a way as resistant as possible to capitalist recapture?
