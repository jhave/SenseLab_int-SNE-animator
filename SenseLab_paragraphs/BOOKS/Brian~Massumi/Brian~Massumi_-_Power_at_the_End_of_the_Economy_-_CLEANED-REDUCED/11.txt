But there is a problem. It has to do with the future. Success, of course, is not guaranteed for any particular act, or any particular individual. The self-organizing of the system at the largest scale can synthesize its way past many a micro-failure. As choices percolate through the economic field, the negative impact of individual failures is compensated for oveall by the multiplier effects of the successes. Given the infinitely of accidents riddling the economic field of life and the existential blindness of all economic actors, there is an ever-present threat of a misstep. Every economic calculation is a calculus of risk. "Behavioral finance (psychology) and rational actor models (the 'rational economic man', or REM) rarely emphasize how UNCERTAINTY differs from RISK AND PROBABILITY" (Pixley 2004, 18). You can calculate risk in terms of probabilities, but probabilities by nature have nothing to say about any given case. The affect accompanying uncertainty is there, in any case. Choices in the present become highly charged affectively with fear for the uncertain future. The present is shaken, tremulous with futurity. There is no calculus of risk independent of an individual's affective self-relation to uncertainty.
