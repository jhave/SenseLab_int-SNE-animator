None of this prevents structures of rationality from building, and settling into the world, evolving what become critical functions, as the field of relation wraps itself around them. Structures of rationality make them indispensable, including, of course, for the economy. This process requires the creation of relatively closed milieus capable of filtering the noise of the overall field of relation. Setting up boundary conditions pre-reduces incoming complexity, controlling the destabilizing power of field-perturbations. The result is an eddy of relative stability (a less provisional metastability) in which rational procedures can institutionalize themselves in way that guarantees a regularity of result. Technoscience, of course, is the most outstanding example (and bureaucracy the basest).
