The first task is critique, understood in the very specific sense of the identification of errors of perceptual judgment. These can be thought of as objective illusions: incongruities effectively built into the relational conditions of an occasion of perception that embed a defect into its genesis. Whitehead's favorite example is taking an object in a mirror to lie behind it. Objective illusions are not simple glitches. They are the positive product of life's entropic tendency to the conformation of feelings: habitual presuppositions (for example, the regularities of perspective) that feed forward into a new situation because the usual cues are in force, while counter-cues that something is amiss, although they are also present, fail to take effect. Objective illusions are a conditioned failure to register the full singularity of the situation. They result in the newly arising occasion being likened, in its essential traits, to previously known situations. The new situation is erroneously experienced as being more similar to a class of other events, than it is different in its own occurrence. In its critical role, reason can exercise its historically acquired taste for foundations or grounds by returning perceptual judgment to its grounding in singularity, in cases where it strays too far toward the perceptual pole of the conformation of feelings. This task requires reason to overcome its also historically acquired, and perhaps even more strongly engrained, passion for generality, and the classificatory logic that sustains it. Thus reason must  concurrently conduct a self-critique of its love of the general idea. An objective illusion is precisely the form in which general ideas are effectively found in the world. Traditionally, "rationality" has aggrandized them—amplified them— rather than regrounding them in the singularity from which they come. The "subject" is the most widespread and processually significant of these rationally-aggrandized objective illusions.
