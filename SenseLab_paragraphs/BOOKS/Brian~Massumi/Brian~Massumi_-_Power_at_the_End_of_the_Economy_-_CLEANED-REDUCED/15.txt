Why defer satisfaction if the capitalist future is constitutively uncertain? But on the other hand, how can you not play it safe by deferring your satisfaction, precisely because the capitalist future is so uncertain? This conundrum of deferral is an expression of the paradox that neoliberalism's promise of satisfaction unnerves the rationality it extols, giving it the affective shakes that cannot be cured. The rational risk calculations of the subject of interest become more and more affectively overdetermined by the tension between fear of the future and hope for success, and between satisfaction and its uncertain deferral. The embrace of rational self-interest and affective agitation becomes all the closer. They fall all the more intensely into each other's orbit, to the point that they contract into each other, entering into a ZONE OF INDISTINCTION, at the heart of every act.
