Thus disabused, reason can proceed to its second task. In order to succeed at its corrective task, reason must enter into the closest of cooperation with abductive experience. It must processually embrace what its hybris too often leads it to regard as its "irrational" opposite. It must become a fellow-traveller of the kinds of relational experimentations described at the end of the main essay above. It must lovingly accompany them, recognizing that the "means" it can test, and help construct, are techniques of relation: experimental setups for producing felicitous conditions for the inventive exercise of abduction, in the infra-transindividual mode in which it natively operates.
When reason abandons its hybristic belief in its power to be a motive force, and its overweened sense of its own grandiosity, when it surrenders itself to co-operation with affectivity, it actually gains something it can never attain by itself: creativity. The fact that reading and multi-step mathematical operations can occur nonconsciously means that highly elaborated, rational techniques can feedback-feedforward into the germinal level of experience, to operate flush with perception's genesis. Consciously elaborated means of action can become nonconscious, as part of a process whereby practice becomes perception. The results of cognition and rational cogitation go down the rabbit-hole that is the regressive endpoint of life, turning around from which life arises anew. There, rationality enters through its own results into superposition with the other modes of activity churning there, including of course those which give rise to perceptual judgments and abductions. Rationality actively enters into mutual inclusion with affectivityâ€”effectively enfolding into the affective wave-packet. As enveloped in bare activity, reason becomes ontopowerful. By association, at least: in co-operation. It becomes a contributory co-operative factor of becoming.
