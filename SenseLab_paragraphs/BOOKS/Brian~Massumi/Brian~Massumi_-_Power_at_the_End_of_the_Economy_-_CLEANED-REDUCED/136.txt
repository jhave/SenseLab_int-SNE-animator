This is where the issue of choice comes back in. Although a passion is a volition, it IS NOT A CHOICE: it is at the hub of a process that runs it course automatically, in the instant, without any intervention by a deciding subject. The process is self-deciding. Choice comes out between passions. It comes from passions entering into combat with other passions, tendencies with opposing or elsewise-oriented tendencies, in bare activity. "Nothing can oppose or retard the impulse of passion, but a contrary passion" (ibid.). In bare activity, passions duke it out among themselves, flush with perception, imbued with nonconscious thought, already potentially readying an issue in action. This affective thinking-feeling is not the opposite of rationality. It is not reducible to the simple negation of rationality. It may be NONRATIONAL, BUT IT IS NOT IRRATIONAL. The passion with which it comes is an "original existence." It is an original, tendentially self-affirming existence, and as such must be described in positive terms as its own ontopowerful process.
