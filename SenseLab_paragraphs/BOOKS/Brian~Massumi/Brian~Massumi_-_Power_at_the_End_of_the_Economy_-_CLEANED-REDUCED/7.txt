The "invisible hand" makes at least a cameo appearance in every discussion of the free market. Foucault's is no exception. As its inventor Adam Smith conceived it, Foucault argues, the concept of the invisible hand had nothing of the God-like quality that has come to be attributed to it. The whole point of the concept was that the economic system is too churningly complex for there to be any possibility of a lordly overview upon it. In his genealogy of neoliberalism, Foucault makes the point in no uncertain terms: when it comes to things economic, there is no "total transparency" (Foucault 2008, 279). Not only is there no total transparencyâ€”there is no transparency or totality. The concept of the invisible hand, as Foucault interprets it, is a principle of blindness in an open field of ceaseless activity whose contours, always shifting, are by nature indefinite. "Being in the dark and the blindness of all the economic agents is an absolute necessity" (297).
