The word "idea" should not mislead. For Hume, an idea is a type of PERCEPTION.28 This account of the transformation effected by sympathy is entirely compatible with the earlier discussion in this essay of perceptual judgment and abduction if the process is understood as a MUTUAL INCLUSION in the same event of differing modes of activity: affection, perception, impression, idea, passion. "Affection" is meant in the simple sense of a being-affected: an undergoing. A perception of another's affection gives rise to an idea of the other's pain or pleasure. The idea strikes me, and the force of the strike converts the idea into an impression. This yields a vivacity of feeling, which generates a passion—which I directly experience as an affection in me, of myself. All these modes must be seen as CO-OCCURRING "INSTANTANEOUSLY," fused into a single event occurring at a nonconscious level of immediate experience. The "communication" of the affective force of the other's experience into an affectation of my experience is no less direct for being multimodal. In the instant, the modes involved are in superposition—as are the other and me, in shared undergoing. The "views" and "reflections" are immanent to the sympathetic perception's arising.
