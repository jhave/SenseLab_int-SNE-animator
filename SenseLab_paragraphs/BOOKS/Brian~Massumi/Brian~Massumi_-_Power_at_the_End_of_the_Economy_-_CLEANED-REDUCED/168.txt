Why not let the qualitative surplus-values of life that are lived for their own worth stay what they essentially are, as corroborated by just about anyone's gut feeling: unquantifiable? WHAT ABOUT AN INTENSITY POLITICS, AS AGAINST A HAPPINESS ECONOMICS? Going that non-neoliberal route would involve tweaking and amplifying tendencies that intuitively understand the other as a sign of passion, and the relationship to the other that is immediately a self-relation, as an actuation of collective potential. It would involve as well inventing new tendencies that enable infra-trans cross-sensitivities to settle into frequentable action-paths in the world, as alternatives to the infernal alternatives of capitalism. Such a politics would be less grounded in the MACRO-POLITICS of PARTY PROGRAMS or IDEOLOGY-BASED CRITIQUE and resistance, than it would pivot on affirmative affective practices of event-conditioning and priming. It would not be conducted in the name of any individual's self-interest, or even in the name of any resemblance/familiarity/contiguity-based group interest. It would reside in the intensive-collective affections of the unspecifiable whole of the relational field, oscillating itself toward a possible world of its own abductive invention, beyond neoliberal capitalism. Its power would be of affective contagion, for an ever-always qualitatively-more to life.
