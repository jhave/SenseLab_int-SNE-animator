The individual's self-relation, in the "dissociative" dividual dimension, is the crucible of the system's integral self-organizing. Each little act helps inflect the system's global direction, as the economy bootstraps its future on the fly. The system's future is also each individual's future, as it navigates a life journey through economic successes and failures. The system and its denizens become in tandem. Every little act exerts a quantum of creative power, globally and locally, in accordion-playing correlation. Every little choice exerts, to some degree, a power of local-global becoming: an ONTOPOWER. What has been lost to the system and to individuals in terms of knowablility, calculability, and predictability, is regained in resonant ontopower. An ontopower, as a power of becoming, is a creative power. The economic model, Foucault said, is now one of existence itself. Existence itself: where being is becoming.
