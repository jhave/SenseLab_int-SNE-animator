Every event is complexioned, exhibiting its own signature fusion of affectivity and rationality. Events of decision that we experience as rational choices, seemingly without the motive force of affect to move them, envelop in their complexion all the infra-aspects just described, including the functional equivalence of affective involvement and will. They just ignore or deny them. For as we will see with Hume, there is no purely rational reason to make any particular choice, or even to make a choice at all. REASON HAS NO MOTIVATING FORCE. For one thing, its rational calculations could go on forever. Reason ruminates, in a way that can never fully digest itself. The rumination may came closer and closer to a rationally justifiable conclusion, but left to its own devices it would never actually reach one because there will always remain a logical possibility that some crucial factor had been overlooked or miscalculated. Rationality, practiced as if it effectively had decisional autonomy, is THE FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENT OF DOUBT. It is haunted by its own version of the "stopping problem" in computer programming. Ultimately, the cut has to happen. And it can only happen if something cuts into the rumination, to cut it off. Calculatio interruptus. This is the feat of affect. It will always occur at a point which, from the point of view of rationality's constitutive indigestion, can only be arbitrary.
