Ecology of Practices
The political question, then, is not how to find a resolution. It’s not how to impose a solution. It’s how to keep the intensity in what comes next. The only way is through actual differentiation. Different lines of unfolding bring the contrast into actuality, between them. The political question is then what Isabelle Stengers calls an “ecology of practices.” How do you tend this proliferation of differentiation? How can the lines not clash and destroy each other? How do they live together? The “solution” is not to resolve the tension through a choice, or find a general compromise, but to modulate the tension into a complex symbiosis. A cross-fertilization of capacitations that live out, to the fullest, the intensity of the event of their coming together.
