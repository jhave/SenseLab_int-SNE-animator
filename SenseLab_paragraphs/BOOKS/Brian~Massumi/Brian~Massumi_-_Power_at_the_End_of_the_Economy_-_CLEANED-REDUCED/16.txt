It's a vicious circle. Positive multiplier effects can be counted on only when individuals' rational choices mutually reinforce each other, catching like a contagion. This is the point at which rational choice is indistinguishable from "irrational exuberance" (in the legendary phrase of U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan). This is also precisely the mechanism that forms speculative bubbles leading to crisis. More radical than the fact that the same mechanism that promises satisfaction makes it exponentially less certain is the fact the attainment of the very satisfaction promised can itself bring on a crisis. The tired hound of self-interest, circling in for satisfaction, traces its own private vicious circle in its self-relating movements. Its sleep will be agitated. It will twitch with dreams of disappearing rabbits.
