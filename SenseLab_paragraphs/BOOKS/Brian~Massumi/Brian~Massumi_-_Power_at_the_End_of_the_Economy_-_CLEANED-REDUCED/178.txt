This occurred in a cross-sensitivity braced into action by an EVENT WHOSE SCALE DWARFS THE HUMAN SCALE. Far from engaging our "natural sentiment," the event's deciding was nothing less than monstrous. Even if the setting is not as physically out-of-scale as the World Trade Towers, it was still excessive. The sense of it is still out of sync with the human scale of the everyday decisions passing through our ordinary lives: it something that it is HUMANLY UNTHINKABLE TO FEEL, AND HUMANLY UNFEELABLE TO THINK. You could say that it's sublime, if such is your philosophical inclination. You could also say it's wondrousâ€”in a paradoxical, down-the-rabbit-hole kind of way. Or maybe, just quirky.
