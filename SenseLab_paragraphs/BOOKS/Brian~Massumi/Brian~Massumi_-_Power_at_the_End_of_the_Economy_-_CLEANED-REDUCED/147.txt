The alternative to grounding decision and volition in the hedonic distinction between pain and  pleasure is to introduce the category of INTENSITY into the affective picture. Intensity is nonhedonic. It is not a subjective state expressing an affective investment of the person. It is a DIMENSION OF EVENTS into which the life of the body is braced. The intensity of an event is the bracingness of its qualitative tenor: what Hume calls its "vivacity" or "LIVELINESS." Hume always speaks of the vivacity of a phenomenon in terms of degrees. Intensity is not binary, like pain/pleasure, but lies on a continuum. Hume never speaks of vivacity as a STATE, always as a FORCE. The vivacity or intensity of an impression or an idea makes it more affecting, and thus more forcefully effective as an generator of passion and tendency. The concept of intensity is a strange one, by the usual hedonic standards. It is the notion of a QUALITATIVE FORCE immanent to events that gives them their power to effect transitions: their decisional power to make a cut that continues the flow of events. INTENSITY IS WHAT AFFECTIVE VOLITION FEELS LIKE. Its motive force is clearly not beholden to self-interest. It is in the service of the liveliness it is. It's all about VITALITY, AS A SELF-AFFIRMING VALUE, expressed as a power to effect transitions in the world. An event of uncommon intensity produces A SURPLUS-VALUE OF LIFE: a boost of vitality that is communicated by sympathy, and tendentially spreads, affirming itself in and as a power of contagion. INTENSITY LIES AT THE BASIS OF ONTOPOWER. It is the qualitative force boosting of becoming. For as we saw earlier, new passions, corresponding to emergent tendencies, invent themselves through the affective process of sympathy's playing out.
