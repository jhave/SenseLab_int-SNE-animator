In the present context, it is capital to remember that the disciplinary inculcation of normed behavior invariably revolves around delayed gratification—the very notion of which is now struck by neoliberal paradox. This is why Foucault makes a point of saying that the rise of neoliberalism coincides with "A MASSIVE WITHDRAWAL FROM THE NORMATIVE-DISCIPLINARY SYSTEM" (Foucault 2008, 260). Under neoliberalism, the right to choose in accordance with one's self-interest becomes inalienable: "irreducible and nontransferable." Satisfaction is the sign of a self-interest well served, and so becomes the human-capital measure of the success of the economic entrepreneurship driving the economy. Its uncertain deferral has become under neoliberalism an irreducible and nontransferable problem. The neoliberal process assumes the problem. Neoliberalism finds it far more satisfying to live out the paradoxes of its own doctrine of choice—to surf the perturbational limit-zones of indistinction between affectivity and rationality that riddle its relational field—than to return to the normative containment of self-interest as a palliative or regulatory principle. Its passion is for deregulation. It happily chooses "creative destruction" over palliative care. It affirms the perturbations of far-from-equilibrium "oscillatory processes" over the normative stability of regulated change. Zones of indistinction between affectivity and rationality such as deliberation-without-attention and choice-blindness are something it can work with (a gold-mine for new marketing strategies!). Good citizenship is altogether too unenterprising.
