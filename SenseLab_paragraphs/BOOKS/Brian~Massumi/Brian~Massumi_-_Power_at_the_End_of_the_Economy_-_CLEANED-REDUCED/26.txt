When Foucault says that the individual's choice is irreducible, he can only mean that the individual's tendential dividedness in relation to itself is irreducible. The dividual is irreducible. The infra- of the individual is irreducible, in the sense that when system-wide perturbations blow down its hole they can go no further. They have nowhere else to go but to turn around and blow back out. The economy ends in the recesses of the infra-individual, which as Foucault said is not only irreducible but nontransferable. What is nontransferable is inexchangeable. At the infra-individual level, the possibility of exchange comes to an end. If the economy is defined by exchange, then the economy ends in the recesses of the infra-individual. It reaches a limit, as a function of which it is organizedâ€”but which lies outside its logic. Foucault speaks of this affective infra-level as the "REGRESSIVE ENDPOINT" of the economy (Foucault 2008, 272).
