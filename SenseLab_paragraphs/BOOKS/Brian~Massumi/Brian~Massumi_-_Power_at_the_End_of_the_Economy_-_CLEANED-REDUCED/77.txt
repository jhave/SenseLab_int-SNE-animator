Fears of irrationalism construe the inability of an individual to choose wisely as the problem. But WHAT IF THE PROBLEM WERE INSTEAD THE RECEIVED IDEA THAT GROUNDING DECISION IN PERSONAL CHOICE IS FREEING? What if the problem is less the individual's affective inability to control its "impulses," or even the conditioning of its actions by others, than the fact that the freedom of choice is imposed. In both experiments, participants were called upon to judge. The imperative of rational choice calls upon the individual to act as if it were a rational animal all the way down. It attempts to lodge the individual's experience on the level of ratiocination, as if the spectrum of an experience could be reduced to the narrow bandwidth of conscious cognition, and perception were only a transparent window on a representation of the world from which the subject stands back in sovereign judgment. This amounts to an attempt to defuse the infra-individual level of bare-active tendency and any emergent autonomy of decision. It is a denial of nonconscious activity and of the dividuality for which it churns. The dividual infra-complexity of life can be backgrounded, but it cannot be entirely defused or denied. Its tendency is to reassert itself, across its silencing. The dividual rises, sometimes all the more insistently the more it is sidelined. All of this is neglected by the doctrine of rational choice and the simplistic opposition between rationality and affectivity on which it ostensibly relies. All of this is studiously neglectedâ€”and then the failure of someone to exercise their rational choice as wisely as a judge is greeted by ejaculations of scandalized surprise.
