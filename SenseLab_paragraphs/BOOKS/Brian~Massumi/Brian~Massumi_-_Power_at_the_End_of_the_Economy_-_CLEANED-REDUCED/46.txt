In the strange HYPERDIFFERENTIATED INFRA-ZONE OF INDISTINCTION BETWEEN CONTRASTING STATES, who or what decides? Dividually speaking, who or what chooses? Choice happens, there is no denying it. And as it happens, it is creative: an ontopowerful act. It is tantamount to an existential decision. But who or what decides? The answer is: no one. As in the French personne, which can mean both a someone and no one. Decision happens: affectively-systemically, in the nonconscious processual autonomous zone where mutually exclusive states come together. THE EVENT DECIDES, AS IT HAPPENS.
