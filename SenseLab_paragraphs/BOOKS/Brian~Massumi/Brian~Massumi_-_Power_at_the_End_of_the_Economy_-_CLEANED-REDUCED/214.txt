Feedforward rebounds on the very concept of tendency. Tendency is a passionate orientation governing movement toward an attractor, or desired terminus (using "desire" in the subjectless sense developed in this essay of an autonomy of decision affirming its own affective motive force). The emergent, nonlinear complexity-effects of feedback-feedforward operating together can alter or even reinvent the terminus. This is what it means to invent a tendency. Given the natural disposition of the world to becoming, this reinvention of tendential termini is more often the case than not. The terminus, as William James observed, "ninety-times out of a hundred" remains "virtual" (James 1996, 69, 71-72). It is not a "the" terminus: it is a singularly multiple constellation of superposed, potential terminal states, together in contrast, and under constant reformatting. There is only one thing a tendency, as an affective volition, wants more than to reach its terminus, and that is to continueâ€”to affirm its reality as a tending-toward (as opposed to an arrival, which is a very different animal). Tending-toward is constitutively open-ended, by nature implicated in movements of invention.
