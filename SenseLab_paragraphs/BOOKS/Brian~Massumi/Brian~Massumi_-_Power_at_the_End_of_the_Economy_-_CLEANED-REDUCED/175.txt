Yes, these ordinary heroes are just like you or me. There is nothing extraordinary in their makeup that separated them out from us by nature before the event. Their distinction is to have acted on gut feeling without a moment's hesitation in the heat of the event. IT IS THE EVENT THAT MADE THEM EXTRAORDINARY. They can only claim to have been bathed in the glow of its exceptional nature. They are haloed by the glow only because they surrendered themselves to the event. They opened their lives to it, such that what was to become of them, who they would be in the end, COINCIDED WITH ITS "INTERESTS": its freedom to play itself out as it will.
