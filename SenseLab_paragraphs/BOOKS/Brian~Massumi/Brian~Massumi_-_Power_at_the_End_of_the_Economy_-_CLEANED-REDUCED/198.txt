Neoliberal multiplier effects return to the same old figure of human capital: the subject of interest as enterprise-subject, caught in the paradoxes of rational choice. Neoliberalism thrives on producing new variations on the enterprise-subject. This is a remarkably multiple-singular sameness. But a sameness it is nonetheless, in the sense that all of the variations revolve around an endlessly reproduced equation between corporate entities and individual entities. The "corporations are people too" aspect of neoliberalism imposes a single model of (non)personhood that operates across scales, but only in the register of private interest. The collective level and the individual level are required to share a formal identity: that of the person as enterprise-subject. They are required, formally, to conform to that overaching model. Amid the diversity, in and through the proliferation of singularities whose emergence its far-from-equilibrium oscillatory processual fielding fosters, neoliberalism strives to hook every enterprise fish in its swell with a formal equation whose aim is to hold it all together in the capitalist orbit of the tendency to produce quantitative surplus-value.
