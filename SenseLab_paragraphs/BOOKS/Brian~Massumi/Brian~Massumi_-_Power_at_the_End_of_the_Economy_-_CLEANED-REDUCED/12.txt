Even in the best-case scenario, rationality and affectivity cannot be held safely apart. Unlike the juridical subject of the law and the civil subject of society, the economic subject of interest is never called upon to renounce its self-interest for the general good. Self-interestedness remains "unconditional." It is measured in SATISFACTION. We have been successful in our self-interestedness if we have attained satisfaction for ourselves. What the economically productive subject of interest ultimately produces is its own satisfaction (Foucault 2008, 226). Paradoxically, the measure of HOW "RATIONALLY" A SUBJECT OF INTEREST BEHAVES CAN ONLY BE MEASURED AFFECTIVELY, in the currency of satisfaction. Rationality and affectivity are joined at the self-interested hip, in one way or another, for better and for worse. "Emotions function in the core structures of the financial world" (Pixley 2004, 18).
