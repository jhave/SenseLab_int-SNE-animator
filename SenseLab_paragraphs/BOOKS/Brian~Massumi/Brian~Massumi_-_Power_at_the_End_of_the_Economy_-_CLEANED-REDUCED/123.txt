This political-intuitive invention is a necessity of life. There is a need to escape the presuppositions of the field of relation into which we are collectively braced. Not by opposing them with an alternate utopian universe where individual choice is finally enabled and allowed free reign (as if such a thing were conceivable, given the web of interdependencies and cross-sensitivities that are part of the warp and woof of life). Not by rationalizing the entire field of life through the good graces of a tribunal of judgment acting from on high (were such a thing possible, even if it were desirable). Rather, by immanently event-converting this rabbit-holed neoliberal world in which we churn. By inventively gesturing neoliberal life toward a whole-field change of state.
