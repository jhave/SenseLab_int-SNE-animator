So: no need to wait for the "right" conditions. There are no right conditions. There are only singular conditions. Experimentally tweak them. Emit signs of passion. Catalyze whatever events lie in your dividual-transindividual reach. Make joy. Take joy in what qualitiative surplus-values of life are potentially ready for the living where you are. Make a micropolitical commotion, and nudge it toward abductive action. Surrender yourself artfully, in a relation to others that is your self-relation to the future, in an activism of the event.
