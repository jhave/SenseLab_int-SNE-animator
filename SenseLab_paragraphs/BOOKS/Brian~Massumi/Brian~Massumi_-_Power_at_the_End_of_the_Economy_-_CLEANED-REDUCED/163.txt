Not forgetting that CAPITAL itself is defined in relation to the future. Capital is not a quantifiable sum of money. It is a potential quantitative increase in the future of a sum of money invested now. This potential increase is surplus-value. Surplus-value is "realized" in profit taken (rather than being rolled forward back into investment-capital). Profit, of course, is countable. Although surplus-value is not in itself quantitative, it is QUANTIFIABLE IN THE FORM OF PROFIT. Capitalism is the CAPTURE OF THE FUTURE for the production of quantifiable surplus-value. CAPITALISM IS THE PROCESS OF CONVERTING QUALITATIVE SURPLUS-VALUE OF LIFE INTO QUANTIFIABLE SURPLUS-VALUE.
