The affective feeling of the readiness potential, Luhmann continues, presupposes a "corresponding reserve of energy which is elsewhere not determined" (Luhmann 1979, 80). In other words, the system itself, because it is similarly complex and nonlinear, is in an energized state of readiness potential that is structured in a fashion homologous the subject's affective state. The economy is ready and "responsive," poised like its individual units, for what may come, in a state of brinking agitation. On the infra-level, the brinking is a superposition of trust and distrust in readiness potential. On the macroeconomic level, what is held in readiness potential are the system states of SUCCESS OR FAILURE. At the moment a given choice is made, the success or failure of that action is "undetermined elsewhere." Which way it will go will depend on actions still in tendency, as yet undecided. The economic outcome depends on how these tendencies' expressions will inflect and amplify each other as they turbulently play out across the economic field in a cascade of caroming choices. When this self-organizing process works itself out, the cumulative effects will be "collected" and "summed up" in a system indicator. Until the "mood" of the economy comes to expression in this way, success and failure will remain in a state of superpositionâ€”as will trust and distrust at the individual level. The affective states of trust and distrust and the system states of success and failure lie at the two oscillatory poles of the economic process. They are sensitive to each other. They reciprocally determine each other, effectively connecting across their differences of nature and the distance between levels through a complex, nonlinear process of feedback and feedforward.
