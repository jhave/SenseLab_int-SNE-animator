As this state of affective agitation heightens, what economic actors often end up reacting to most directly are the agitated affective states of other actors. This has given rise to a whole new service industry, that of "internet mood analysis." The internet is trawled by algorithms that search out affectively laden words and terminology to provide a real-time pulse-taking of the mood of the economy. These services go by such names as "AlmagaMood," whose catchy slogan is "Leveraging Big Data to Enhance Investment Foresight."9 It is not just economic sites that are mood-mined. It is the entire internet, including blogs, news sites, and the expanding Twitterverse. The economy as a whole vibrates with the fickleness of what the pundits call "social mood." This internet-based mood registering occurs informally through the social media and all manner of networking. In our networked society, with the global media reach and cross-platform convergence of the internet, any act anywhere resonates, potentially, everywhere, in the economic analogue of Einstein's "spooky" action at a distance. Readiness-potential wave-packets collapse, affectively-systemically, in real-time (or its functional internet equivalent). Individual actions are AFFECTIVELY ENTANGLED AT A DISTANCE. It is only the complex playing-out of the entanglements that decides in the end what will have been a success and what a failure. Complexly correlated to each quantum of success or failure, there will come to expression  determinate affective states of trust or distrust, satisfaction or frustration.
