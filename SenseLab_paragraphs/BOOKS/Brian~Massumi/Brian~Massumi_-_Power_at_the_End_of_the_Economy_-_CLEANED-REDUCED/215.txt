Reason's means-testing task is therefore much more complicated than it might seem at first. Rationality cannot presume to be capable of handling this corrective role in isolation, because what needs its evaluations are tendencies, whose open-ended emergent complexity is precisely the kind of thing that is beyond rationality's ken. The first thing reason needs to do to make itself worthy of this task is to conduct another self-critique, this time of its passion for causality. Like reason's love for generality, its attachment to causality is a glorification of habit: a product of the engrained expectation of a certain result based on the regularity with which like results were experienced in past occasions perceived to be of a similar kind.46 Rationality's overwrought attachment to traditional models of causality is thus another result of the objective illusion that consists in unperceiving the singularity of situations, specifically as regards the self-relation to their own future of the tendencies presently running through the situation's perceived configuration. The two self-critiques of reason must be intimately coupled. Together, they must disabuse reason of its instinctive distrust toward affectivity and intuition.
