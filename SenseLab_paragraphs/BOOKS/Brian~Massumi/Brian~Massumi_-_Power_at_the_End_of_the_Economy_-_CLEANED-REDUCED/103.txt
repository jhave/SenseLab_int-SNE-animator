Without having had the time to consciously think it through, potential lines of escape appear to you. You prefiguratively feel yourself avail yourself of them, in BUDS OF ACTIONS poised to play out. Incipient actions come together, in an immediate feeling of the alternatives they offer. You have been braced into the a field of potential composed of a multiplicity of paths of action. Your life is in that multiplicity, splayed between alternatives. Which to choose? No time to ponder. There is only time to act, and perhaps not even that, successfully. No sooner has the field of potential proposed itself than you have already assessed the alternatives. You have registered the distance between you and the bull, between you and the fence following different paths, without consciously puzzling it through. You have comparatively registered the time necessary for each potential escape, without actually having had any time to calculate the comparisons. You have considered which gestures will incite the bull and which will cause it to pause, without actually deliberating on bull behavior. Your body launches into movement, following what you viscerally feel to be the best course, with a rush of feeling you could never separate out from the situational assessments and the calculations that you didn't actually have the time to make—or from the experience of the movement itself. You have performed an EMBODIED THINKING-FEELING IN MOVEMENT, all it one splash. Your dawning realization of the presence of the bull included all of this. You escape. In effect, you have made a life-saving choice—without having performing anything like a separate act of choice. You have acted "rationally," without the ratiocination. You have gained your freedom from the bull, without exercising freedom of choice per se.
