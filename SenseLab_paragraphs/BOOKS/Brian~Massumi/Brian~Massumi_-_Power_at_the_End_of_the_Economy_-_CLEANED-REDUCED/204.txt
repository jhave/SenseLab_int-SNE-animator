Toward an Anticapitalist Art of the Event
  
CAPITALIST POWER, IT WAS SAID EARLIER, IS AN ONTOPOWER: a positive power of becoming, a creative power operating relationally between the oscillatory poles of the dividual and the transindividual (its own individualist rhetoric notwithstanding; or, more precisely, withstanding all too well its paradox). ONTOPOWER, IT WAS ALSO SAID, CAN ONLY BE COUNTERED BY ONTOPOWER. Further, it was asserted that this requires practicing intuition as a political art. "Art," because a counter-capitalist ontopower brings into relief the aesthetic dimension of life, defined by Whitehead as the invention of modes of compossibility among normally mutually excluding contrasts, in accordance with life's "ultimate aim" of intensification. Intuition as a political art was said to be an art of finessing the event: tweaking its conditions, in order to modulate its tendings and their issuings into determinate action, toward the collective fabulation predicated on a QUALITATIVE ALTER-ECONOMY of directly lived life-value.
