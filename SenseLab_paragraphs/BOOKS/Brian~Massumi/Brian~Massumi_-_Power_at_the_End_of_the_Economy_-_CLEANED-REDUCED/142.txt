Although it may be generally the case that sympathy is preferentially structured in this way, there are enough exceptions to the general rule to raise once again the question of what might happen if the constant conditionings aimed at implanting this hierarchy were not in force. Under neoliberalism's "massive withdrawal" from the normative-disciplinary regime of power, hierarchizing conditionings of sympathy lose their anchoring in easily controllable enclosures. They are forced to operate in an open, oscillatory environmental field. This biases them toward the extremes. In order to retain resemblance/familiarity/contiguity-based criteria for sympathetic belonging, affective primings are necessary to suppress or demonize the perception of difference. Given the proliferative nature of capitalism, and its ontopowerful tendency to augment differencings (the better to invent niche markets), virulent primings tending toward FASCIST contagion are required to shore up the sense of identity and reimpose boundaries. This can be seen in the rise of the far right in the United States, beginning with the formal setting in place of the financial mechanisms of the neoliberal economy starting in the late 1970s, and now affecting all areas of Europe, in particular since the destruction of what remained of the social democratic model by the crash of 2007-2008 and the subsequent policies of austerity brutally imposing an abrupt transition to a fully fledged neoliberal model. On the other hand, and at the same time, unleashed from the normative-disciplinary hegemony over the field of relation characterizing the previous phase of capitalism, sympathetic tendencies uninclined toward resemblance/familiarity/contiguity-based hierarchies readily multiply, and go feral, against the grain of "natural sentiment."
