"HAPPINESS ECONOMICS." Happiness economics deals with the paradox of self-interest produced by the tension between the "rational" imperative to defer satisfaction to maximize one's human capital in the long run, and the moment-to-moment need to act now, in fear and uncertainty, in the thick of the neoliberal field of relation's far-from-equilibrium conditions. The paradox is that the tension between the two can easily lead a unit of human-capital to throw up its all-too-visible hands and say, why not get what I can while I can? Instant gratification is better than working my life away for a pension that will be "austerity-ed" away before I can ever collect it. You can always bank on bankruptcy—and start the process all over again. In our capitalist day and age, isn't the subject of interest really just a polite term for the subject of debt in any case? (Lazzarato 2012). Or, on a less callous note: I'm going to concentrate on my quality of life, put time into my family and kids, my art or sports or pastimes, the kinds of things that I experience as having a value in themselves, and take the risk of being caught short later—which given the fact that the subject of interest is really the subject of debt is just as likely to happen anyway if I "rationally" calculate.
