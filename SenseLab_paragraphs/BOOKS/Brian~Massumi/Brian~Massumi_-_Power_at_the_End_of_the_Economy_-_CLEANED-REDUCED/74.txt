Everything still turns around dividuating tendencies, because everything that happens recurs to bare activity. Everything feeds back into the mutually inclusive regressive end-point of the economy infra- to the individual, or resonates with it at an entangled distance. Neoliberal life oscillates around the zone of indistinction between affectivity (affectability) and rationality. In that zone, there is nothing so clear as the alternative between choice or non-choice, freedom or constraint. What there are instead are degrees of freedom: AUTONOMIES OF SELF-EFFECTING DECISION whose emergent movements of expression are liable to modulation by priming mechanisms; tendential playings-out that may be induced or inflected, but whose outcome is statistical; situational sensitivities and openness to relation that deliver the dividual to conditioning, but never divest it of the power to surprise.
