Threshold
The concept of affect as mobilized here is adapted from Spinoza, via Deleuze. Spinoza speaks of the body in terms of its capacity for affecting or being affected. These are not two different capacitiesâ€”they always go together. When you affect something, you are opening yourself up to being affected in turn, and in a slightly different way than you might have been the moment before. You have made a transition, however slight. You have stepped over a threshold. Affect is this passing of a threshold, seen from the point of view of the change in capacity.
