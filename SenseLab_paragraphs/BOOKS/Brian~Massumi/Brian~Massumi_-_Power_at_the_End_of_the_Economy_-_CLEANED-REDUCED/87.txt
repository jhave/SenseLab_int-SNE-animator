Foucault makes it clear that for him the subject of interest, as human capital, cannot be understood in Marxist-humanist terms as "living labor" (Foucault 2008, 225). If the denizen of the market environment lives in a field of immanence that is constitutively open to "oscillatory processes" (259), then the individual is an immanent oscillatory point in "a MACHINE-FLOW COMPLEX" (225).19 The subject of interest is not humanistic but machinic. In order not to stream with the flow entirely at random, the decisions moving through have to machine cuts into the flow. Etymologically, that is what "decide" means: to cut (Whitehead 1978, 43). In Deleuze and Guattari's vocabulary, the very definition of "machine" is that which cuts a flow, and in doing so releases a quantum of subjective-systemic effect, as described in the above discussion of trust (Deleuze and Guattari 1983, 1-8). The micro-economic level of the individual actor is thus sandwiched between Involuntaries No. 1 and  No. 2, or the infra- and the trans- levels respectively. The trans- level is the macro-systemic level, understood from the angle of its implication in a process that is more inclusive than the system itself, in that the process includes not only system-being but becoming.
