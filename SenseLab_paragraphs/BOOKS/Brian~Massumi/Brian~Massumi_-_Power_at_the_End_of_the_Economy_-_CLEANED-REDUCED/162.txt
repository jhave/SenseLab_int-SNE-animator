When we speak of a politics of affect, or a politics of dividualism against neoliberal individualism, we are speaking of holding the event to the key of potential, to the extent possible. We are talking about making an abductive practice of perceptual judgment, bringing into relief the other as a sign of passion in ways that tend less easily to bifurcate toward conventionalized emotions and the general rules of social behavior they facilitate based on resemblance/familiarity/contiguity, as linked to the hedonic opposition between pleasure and pain. We are talking about intensity of moving-relation. We are talking about joy. We are talking about PASSION AS AN ONTOPOWER PRIMED FOR OPEN-ROAD BECOMING, veering off the beaten paths of conventional settlement. We are talking about the feral potential of sympathy, unleashed from the domination of self-interest and the exclusive aim of personal satisfaction. We are talking about life, enlivened, with its full charge of infra-trans cross-sensitivities. We are talking about the aim of life toward intensity, toward the production of qualitative surplus-values of experience. We are talking about RELATIONS TO THE OTHER THAT ARE IMMEDIATELY SELF-RELATIONS TO THE FUTURE. We are talking about reclaiming the future for collective potential.
