Technoscience's boundary conditions are patrolled by what Bruno Latour "tribunals of reason"—mechanisms of judgment pronouncing certain phenomena and modes of activity as admissible for rational proceduralization and rejecting others as irremediably "irrational" (Latour 1987, 183-184). The result is less an enclosure than a set of transactional parameters regulating both the interactions occurring internal to milieu, and the coupling of the work of the internal milieu to the forces of the outside: a differential network. The control of field perturbations is not only exerted at the boundary. It is repeated inside the network, in the proceduralization of its signature activities.24 Activity is painstakingly formatted for the production of the promised regularity of result. The scientific method's procedures for ensuring "controlled experiments" fulfill this role for technoscience. They amount to disallowing field-interferences by isolating which contributory factors will be allowed to express themselves, so that they can be effectively treated as independent variables, making them more manipulable. Complexity is then built back up toward, from these basic building blocks—as if the world were an edifice rather than an "unspecified whole of flow," and as if the ordering of the world rode a one-way elevator to the upper stories (at the very top of which is perched the penthouse of analytic reason). In a word, a highly strategized, and standardized, practice of event-conditioning is set in place.
