This means that we need to add a whole new dimension to economic thinking. Beneath the MICRO-ECONOMIC level of the individual there is the INFRA-ECONOMIC LEVEL. At that level, an affective commotion intra-churns. Its variations are so immediately linked that we cannot parse them out into separate occurrences. The individual, speaking infra-ly, is not one. It may collect itself as one. It may figure as one, for higher levels. But in itself, it is many. Many TENDENCIES: potential expressions and orientations held together in tension. Buffeted by these tendencies' coming turbulently together, divided among them in its relation to itself. Divided among them, awaiting their complex playing out in a shift in general orientation, the "individual" is the DIVIDUAL (Deleuze 1995, 180). The dividual is the individual as affective infra-climate, in relation to itself, commotionally poised for what may come, storm or shine, doldrums or halcyon days.
Nothing divides and multiplies the individual so much as its own relation to the FUTURE.
