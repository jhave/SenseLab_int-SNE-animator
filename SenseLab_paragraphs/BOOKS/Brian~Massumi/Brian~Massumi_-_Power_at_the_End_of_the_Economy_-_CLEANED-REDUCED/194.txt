Setting the conditions for the event in a way that is already a re-giving of them beyond the event is not the preserve of the militant. It is the problem of the ACTIVIST. The conditions pass through bare-activity. ONLY ACTIVITY ACTS ON ACTIVITY, just as movement only arises from movement, and affection from affection. Freedom is ACTION UPON ACTION. Activism is catalytic-sign action upon the unspecified whole of a tensional field of activities already tendentially stirring. The militant indoctrinates and inculcates; the activist modulates and induces. The militant raises consciousnesses, and brutally punishes recalcitrance; the activist seeks to catalyze what Simondon called a sympathetic "communication of subconsciousnesses" (in the present vocabulary, affective nonconsciousnesses or dividualities). The militant works in the cognitive medium of judgment; the activist tweaks in the affective mode of perceptual judgment. The militant jumps over the stopping problem to "rationally" calculated conclusions; the activist jump-starts abductions. The militant strives to replace self-interest with class interest; the activist relationally moves BEYOND INTEREST.
