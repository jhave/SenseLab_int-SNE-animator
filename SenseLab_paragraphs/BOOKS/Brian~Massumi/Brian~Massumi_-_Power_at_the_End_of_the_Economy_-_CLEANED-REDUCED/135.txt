"REASON ALONE CAN NEVER PRODUCE ANY ACTION, OR GIVE RISE TO VOLITIOn" (3.1.3, 460). There is simply no common ground between rationality and affectivity that can become a battle ground. "A PASSION IS AN ORIGINAL EXISTENCE, or, if you will, modification of existence, and contains not any representative quality, which renders it a copy of any other existence or modification" (ibid.). A thinking that contains a representative quality is what is referred to these days as a COGNITION, and as such belongs to reason. Passion, containing not any representative quality, is noncognitive. As a modification of existence, it is a becoming. Put the two together, and you get a NONCOGNITIVE BECOMING. As the processual hub around which tendencies grow, and grow into conventions of behavior that orient life activity, passion in of itself is TANTAMOUNT TO A VOLITION: its noncognitive becoming is an ONTOPOWER.
