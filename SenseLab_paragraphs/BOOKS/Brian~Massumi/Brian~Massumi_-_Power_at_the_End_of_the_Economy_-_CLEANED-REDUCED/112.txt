Reason's stopping problem is pragmatically solved on the elevator ride up. Criteria for what constitutes acceptable results draw the procedural finish line, imposing the paradoxical but eminently practical mechanism of a regularized arbitrary cut-off point. In science, the main criterion of acceptability is reproducibility. The reproducibility of results caps the filtering-out of the singularity of unbidden field-effects, making them, against all odds, predictable (more or less, and under certain, relatively-closed field conditions). A second criterion is falsifiability (the bureaucratic counterpart of which is the right to appeal). The scientific method's principle of falsifiability is of particular significance here. It expresses the fact that the entire rational structure is built not on overcoming reason's riddling with doubt, but quite the opposite on its institutionalization. Given reason's constitutional inability to expunge doubt, any structure of rationality that does not build doubt into its edifice will end up crumbling. Doubt will return, in form of cracks fatally undermining the edifice (such is the fate of the totalitarian bureaucratic State). Better to build it in constructively than attempt to disavow it. This strategic openness to doubt constitutes the liberalism of structures of rationality, and is the vector by which they are able to settle into the great open neoliberal world, negotiating a self-protective settlement with its far-from-equilibrium fickleness. That, and the fact, in the case of technoscience, that its regularity of results feeds the capitalist process's voracious appetite for product development and constant turnover.
