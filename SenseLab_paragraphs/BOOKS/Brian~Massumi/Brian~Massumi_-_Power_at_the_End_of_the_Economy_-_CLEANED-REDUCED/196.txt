"Micro" is a misnomer. The concept has little to do scale, and everything to do with CROSS-SCALE SENSITIVITIES and relational contagion. All of the events of 2011-2012 were micro-political successes, in spite of their macropolitical failures, in that they released a charge of potential that continues to percolate through the relational field, IN READY RESERVE TO JUMP-CUT TO NEW TAKING-PLACES AND MAKING-TIMES, GIVEN THE CONDITIONS. They HELD A MORE-TO-LIFE, AN EXCESS OF SURPLUS-VALUE OF LIFE, IN RESERVE. They released a quantum of affective-evental "immortality." Occupy Wall Street, for example, reactuated a tendency to "DIRECT DEMOCRACY," reinvented. It invented a new collective figure of freedom: the reclaiming of the public square (not the public sphere), for directly embodied cohabitation (not mediated speech); the open assembly model of indefinitely inclusive whole-field participation; practices favoring the communicative contagion model, as in the example of the "human megaphone;" the refusal to assign a leadership subset that would fragment the relational field and reproduce familiar structures of hierarchy; the refusal of representation, in favor of immediately affecting, effective speech (performative speech, or the use of the linguistic sign as affection-event trigger); and as part of the refusal of representation, a reluctance to enumerate a platform of demands that would make the movement insertable into existing macro-political structures of conflict resolution and negotiation. This is a formidable invention, undoubtedly with many afterlives to come. And with many pre-lives, in anarchist and autonomist event-series.
