For neoliberals, this is actually a good thing: it makes economic liberalism unavoidable. It means that the economy can have no sovereign. The invisible hand actually means "hands off." The liberal's principle of laissez-faire, Foucault quips, becomes for the neoliberals "do-not-laisser-faire government": tie the government's hands (Foucault 2008, 247). Foucault is quick to add that in practice neoliberalism entails a large and even expanding range of forms of governmental intervention. But these are designed, paradoxically, to maintain the ability of market mechnisms to self-organize the economy free from undue government interference (Foucault 2008, 175-176). They do not operate from a position of sovereign command. They are  in the midst.  Any governmental attempt from on high to weave the strands together into a well-defined, predictably regulated whole will just fray the fabric to the ripping point. Government purports to act all-knowingly in the general interest, and in its hybris always fumbles. Individuals, too, are under the injunction, in the name off the general good, to act without regard for it. For it is only then that the "invisible hand" can work.
