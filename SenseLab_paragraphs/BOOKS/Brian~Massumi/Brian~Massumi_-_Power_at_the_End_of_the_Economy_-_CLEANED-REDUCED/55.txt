Economic rationalism cannot be disentangled from self-deciding affective factors—all the less where it matters most. Issues of trust aside, the very question of what counts as a "success" or "failure" is subject to affective interference. It cannot be reduced to a purely economic cost-to-benefit analysis. When the affective interference doesn't come from uncertainty in the environment and the individual's relation to others, it still comes—from the individual's decisional relation to itself. The neoliberal wager of making self-interest the fundamental principle of the economy depends on maintaining a strict equation between life-satisfaction and rational calculus of choice. The denizen of the neoliberal world is called upon to equate the experiential value of its life—the SURPLUS-VALUE OF LIFE that makes each pulse of life feel that it was worth living for itself, above and beyond the increasingly impressive achievement of just getting by—with standard quantitative measures of economic success. It is precisely this equation that increasingly breaks down. It becomes clear that there is something in the very nature of decision that forbids it. The very definition of "success" oscillates between affective and economic determinants. This calls the integrity of human capital into question, and it is not just a circumstantial complication. More like a birth defect in its DNA.
