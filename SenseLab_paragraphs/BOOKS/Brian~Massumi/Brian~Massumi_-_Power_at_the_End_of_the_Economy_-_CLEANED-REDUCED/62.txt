This is the recursive opposite of the collapse of the wave-packet by a future event. A sequence of action produces the wave-packet retroactively. Here, undecidability is not in the suspense of a readiness potential holding the futurity of the present. Rather, it is presently produced as a recursive AFFECTIVE FACT.17 Affectivity and rationality are entwined in a different way here. The affectability of the outcome as registered in qualitative experiential terms—the openness of an experience's satisfaction quotient to situational conditioning—is directly expressed in a RATIONALIZATION. This is another mode of the functional indistinction between affectivity and rationality. Were the individual really that—an individual rather than an in-the-dividual—this could not occur. But it does, and this gives the dividual itself two oscillating poles, corresponding to two modes of undecidability superposing affectivity and rationality. Both, paradoxically, can be understood as modes of overdetermination: on the one hand, an over-fullness with different states held intensely together in readiness potential; on the other, the altogether too-convincing matter-of-factness of the fabulatory fait accompli.
