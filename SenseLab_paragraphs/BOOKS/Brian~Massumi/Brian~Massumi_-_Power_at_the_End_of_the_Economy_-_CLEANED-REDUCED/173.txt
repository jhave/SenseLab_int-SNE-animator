And yet … the ordinary hero did "choose" to feel something that it is ordinarily unthinkable. And she did it in the heat of the event, launched instantaneously into action by the sign of the life-threateing affection of the other. Heroic individuals are invariably portrayed as not consciously choosing. They rush headlong into the towering inferno, without pausing to ruminate for even a millisecond. They abduct themselves into risking their own life, braced into the intensity of an event that is far bigger than their small lives. The transition from the (in this case indexical) sign of the other's predicament to a decisive issue in action is accomplished in no time at all. The "heroic" cut into the flow of the event happens so quickly that the strike of the sign, its registering in an impression arousing an affection producing a passion actuating a tendency issuing into action—all of that barely registers. Or rather, only bare-actively registers, in the dividual recesses of a soon-to-be heroic life (in other words, a self-less death). A nonconscious decision has been made. The hero has been infra-trans-ed into action. THE CHOICE WAS MADE THROUGH HIM—BY THE RELATIONAL EVENT. Those who survive almost invariably describe it that way: I just ran into the wreckage, without even thinking about whether to do it or not, I just had an image of others on the brink of disaster, their lives about to be incinerated and the heart ripped out of their loved ones. A world of possibility about to go up in smoke. So much potential, about to be buried in rubble. What choice did I have? In other words: "I" DIDN'T DO IT—SYMPATHY DID IT. I was but its volitional vehicle, fueled by the other as sign of passion.
