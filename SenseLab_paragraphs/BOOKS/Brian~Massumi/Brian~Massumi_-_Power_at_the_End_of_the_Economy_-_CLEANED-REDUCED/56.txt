It is often recognized in the literature that "gut feeling" tends to flounder when dealing with abstract statistics and probabilities. But we need to take this reservation about gut feeling itself with reservations. For nothing will change the fact that macro-economic indicators are statistical, meaning that they carry a margin of error that makes them inherently uncertain, dealing as statistics do with probabilities. Economic forecasting projects the probabilistic uncertainty forward. This means, once again, that results are undecidable with respect to any particular case. On the level of individual decisions, economic forecasting is little more than a mathematical framework for intuition to work within, garnished with a gloss of scientificity. The calculus of risk is not what it's cracked up to be, as is well attested by the regularity with which crises catch the experts by surprise, even though everyone knows that they periodically recur and are endemic to the capitalist process. The most learned economic number-crunching is affectively surrounded by a penumbra of inexpungeable uncertainty. Individual economic actors ultimately have nowhere else to go but back down the rabbit-hole. No amount of sophisticated modeling will expunge the hard economic fact that under complex conditions of uncertainty rational choice and affect-driven intuition enter a zone of indistinction. To put it another way, "rationality about the unknown requires emotions" (Pixley 2004, 30).
