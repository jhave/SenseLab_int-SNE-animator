Flash, 2011: a self-immolation in Tunisia ignites passionate protest. The affection skips, across a geographical distance and a suspensive interval of bare activity, to Egypt. Passionate protest reignites in Tahrir Square. From there, it reverberates across the globe. A permutation on the event pops up again half-way across the globe, riding on the wings of media signs. Occupy Wall Street takes place, making an anomalous political time for itself: a slow time of otherwise co-inhabiting public space; slow-mo explosion of potential. Next North American stop: Montreal. It is without any advance warning, a student movement amplifies into the largest student strike in Canadian history, and not stopping there, bleeds into a repotentialization of previously flagging, if not yet moribund, community-based social movements (Barney et al. 2012). There WAS NO SPECIFIC CAUSAL CONNECTION from one event in the series to the next, but there was a nonlocal linkage that was immediately, unmistakeably, thought-felt. The events were AFFECTIVELY ENTANGLED AT A DISTANCE, one becoming the trigger-sign for the next, all resonating together in their BELONGING, DIFFERENTLY in each case, to the SAME SERIES.
