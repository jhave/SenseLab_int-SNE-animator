This points to the second sense of the other as sign of passion: possibility points to the FUTURE. The strike of the sign affectively braces me for an unfolding in the course of which passions will be produced, tendencies will duke it out, and actions will issue. All of this occurs in the instant, nonconsciously, in perceptual judgment and abduction, in infra-trans cross-sensitivity, through what Simondon calls an unmediated "communication of subsconsciouses" (Simondon 2005, 249). The trans- communication CORRELATES my affective dividuality—my "preindividuality" in Simondon's vocabulary—with that of another. Our preindividualities differentially participate in the same event, as immediately linked polarities defining its strike. Enveloped in this transindividual correlation between preindividualities is the translation of the potential actuated in the event into the key of cogitative possibility. The bifurcation from affection to emotion, from joy to love, from in-between intensity to subjective content, and from perceptual judgment and abduction to reflective rumination, is included in the affective wave-packet of the event's readiness potential, in tendential bud. The future may unfold according to either path—or even following both, on parallel tracks. Simondon speaks of the "affectivo-emotive" in order to encompass this coming-together of this bifurcation (Simondon 2005, 247). From this perspective, on either or both tracks, THE SIGN OF THE OTHER IS A SIGN OF MY RELATION TO MY OWN FUTURE. This is why the sense of the other as sign of passion is double: in the event, it is both the immediate moving-relation, irreducibly infra-trans-, and my own affectivo-emotive self-relation, across the change the event will bring to my life. My infra-trans relation to the other IS my relation to myself, under two different but co-occurring aspects, in the two contrasting keys of life's polyphony: potentiation and possibilization.
