All signs are that the condition is congenital. Crisis no longer seems a punctual  interval between between periods of stability. Crisis is the new normal. That this should be the case only stands to reason. The premise of any rational calculation is that similarly strategized actions will yield similar results. But the whole point of an economy that selects for creative multiplier effects is that multiplier effects are nonlinear. By definition, they are effects that are not commensurate with their causes, even if the causes be known. The whole point of capitalist enterprise is to "leverage": to extract a surplus yield of effect over and above what would normally be expected to follow from an investment. The capitalist process is driven by the potential for, and yearning after, AN EXCESS OF EFFECT over any given quantity of causative input: SURPLUS-VALUE. The more complex the system is, the more uncertain the future becomes. And complexification has been a constitutive tendency of the capitalist system from its beginnings. Capitalism has always been a far-from-equilibrium system, becoming ever more so. The same multiplier mechanism that promises future satisfaction makes it exponentially less certain.
