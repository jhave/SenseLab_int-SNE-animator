When what is created is a state of system trust, Luhmann emphasizes that the trust is entirely "unjustified" (Luhmann 1979, 78). It may be rationalizable after the fact, but in its genesis it is rationally unfounded. It did not occur as the separate result of a rational decision judiciously preceding the actions that brought it into being. It came flush with an affective regress, and its turn-about playing-out. At the limit, all economic acts are rationally ungrounded in the endpoint of the economy. This does not mean that they are affectively grounded there. Any state of system-trust that emerges is just as affectively unjustified as it is rationally unjustified. It was not grounded in anything preparatory to action that could be qualified as in any way trustworthy. The transactions that worked out well and led to success proved themselves trustworthy. They became trustworthy, as a function of how they played out. The state of system trust is effectively self-justifying. It "justifies itself," Luhmann writes, in the way that it has "become creative" (78): in the emergently creative way it is generated as a trust-effect of the economy's complex self-organizing. The self-organizing emergence of the trust-effect is retroactively validating. It is affectively validating in the currency of satisfactions gained.
