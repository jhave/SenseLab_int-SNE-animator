Whitehead adds an essential element: CONTRAST (Whitehead 1967, 252-264; Whitehead 1978, 162-163, 279-280). What determines the intensity of an experience, he says, are the contrasts it holds together. In other words, AN INTENSITY IS A MEASURE OF THE MUTUAL INCLUSION OF WHAT UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES TENDS TO SEPARATE OUT. Certain events suspend the contrariety of what is normally present as mutually exclusive terms. The more such contrasts an experience is capable of holding in itself, the more intense it is. Because the "terms" are actually tendencies. Objects, perceptual forms and qualities of all kinds, operate as TRIGGERS for the coming activity, already incipiently stirring in the dawning of an experience. They figure as SIGNS OF AN EMERGENT PASSION potentially coming to determine a tendency (recall that Hume's account of the genesis of passion in sympathy began with the strike of a sign). The terms that are held together in their contrast, but minus their contrariety, stand in the incipient experience for co-possible tendencies that elsewhere, in other experiences, will refuse to cohabit. They are present as COMPOSSIBILITIES: co-present alternatives as to which transitions might potentially follow. Or, to return to the bull example, as alternative action-paths, experienced all at once and in their difference from each other, in the form of immediate perceptual judgments and the abductions into which they no sooner extrapolate (lived hypotheses directly experienced in the genesis of the perception). It is the packing into the event of a greater array of compossible tendential unfoldings that intensifies it. Simply put, the more contrasts are held in readiness potential, the more full of life the experience isâ€”the more bracingly bare-active it is, the more lively, the more vital. The more surplus-value of life it produces. The more ample its affective wave-packet.
