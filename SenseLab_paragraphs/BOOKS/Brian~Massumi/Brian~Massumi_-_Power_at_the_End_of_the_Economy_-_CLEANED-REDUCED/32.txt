To act on threats before they emerge was the Bush administration's definition of PREEMPTION (Massumi 2007). The economy is continually agitated by the affectively fraught, felt need to preempt it. As the neoliberal economy takes hold, deferral becomes less and less of an option and preemptive action more and more of an imperative.8 This make economy more affectively ACTIVATING than it is effectively rationalizing. It runs more on perturbations and cascading amplifications than determinate acts of choice.
