The work of happiness economics is made even more difficult by the paradoxical fact that studies consistently find that levels of self-reported happiness and life-satisfaction rise as incomes and standards of living rise above poverty level—but then level off and begin to decline beyond a fairly comfortable middle-class socio-economic status (see for example Potro and Rustichini 2013). This strange anomaly of the "happiness index" even has a name: the "Easterlin Paradox." It's not just that money doesn't necessarily make you happy—it's statistically guaranteed to make you less happy the more you have of it. The rebound effect on the dividual level is the associated fact that nonconscious PRIMING WITH IMAGES OF MONEY makes the following experience less satisfying (Quiodback et al. 2010). This is even the case for chocolate, the fabled pick-me-up of today's depressed units of human capital. The soothing pleasure of consuming chocolate and the taste of money don't mix.
