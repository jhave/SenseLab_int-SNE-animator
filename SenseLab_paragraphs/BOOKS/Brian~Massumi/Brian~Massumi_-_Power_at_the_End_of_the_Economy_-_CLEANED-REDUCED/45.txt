It appears evident that the individual subject of interest can no longer be considered an autonomous agent of calculated choice. IT IS THE ACT OF CHOICE THAT IS AUTONOMOUS, in the dissociative dimension of the dividual: that of the individual, absorbed in its relation to itself, plied by superpositions of contrasting states in a mutual immanence of functional indistinction. Choice spills from the readiness potential of the subject's affective blind spot, nonconsciously. This nonconscious level is NONPERSONAL. In the intensity of its immanence, the entire system at all its scales resonates in potential, carried to the absolute limit of its regressive endpoint. This infra-level holds all system states in itself, immanently, in potential. It only dissociates itself from other individuals and other levels the better to supercharge itself with what, elsewhere in the system, will play as separate states, following divergent tendencies: distributions of success and failure, trust and distrust, boom and bust, satisfaction and frustration, hope and fear. The nonconscious infra-individual level is, at the limit, the nonpersonal SUPERPOSITION of all levels, in the DISSOCIATIVE dimension of their DISTRIBUTIVE coming together.
