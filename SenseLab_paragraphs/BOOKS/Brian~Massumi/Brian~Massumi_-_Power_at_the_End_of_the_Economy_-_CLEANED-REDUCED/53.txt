Consider this in light of the neoliberal economist's insistence, as analyzed by Foucault, that in the deregulated market the individual subject of interest is no longer defined by its social category or anchoring in a community so much as by its enterprise activity. The neoliberal individual is what Foucault calls the ENTERPRISE-SUBJECT. "If capital is defined as that which makes a future income possible, this income being a wage, then you can see that it is a capital which in practical terms is inseparable from the person" (Foucault 2008, 224). The "worker himself appears as a sort of enterprise": "entrepreneur of himself" (225, 226). The individual becomes an enterprise, as the enterprise at all scales becomes the fundamental unit of society (225). The enterprise-individual invests actively, affectively, in its own life, for the future satisfaction of a higher wage, a good return on monetary investment, and a happy retirement. The denizen of the neoliberal economy is no longer a citizen. It is HUMAN CAPITAL (224-265) or, with the gravitas of Latin, homo oeconomicus. Human capital navigates the same field of complexity and enterprise form of life as its fellow corporate persons. "Corporations are people too!" cried the presidential candidate (and the US Supreme Court agrees).12 As human capital, the individual's self-management—its attempts to manage its self-relation as an investment in its own future—must become a creative art of choice. Correlatively the personal art of choice must become corporate, in keeping with the entanglement between levels.
