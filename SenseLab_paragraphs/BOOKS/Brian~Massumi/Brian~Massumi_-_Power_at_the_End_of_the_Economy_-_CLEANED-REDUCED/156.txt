To move sympathy further toward the political, it is sufficient to reconsider the role of the other in Hume's account of the genesis of sympathy. His account begins when a sign of an affection undergone by the other strikes me, triggering a passional process in which the affection communicates itself to me. In order to contain the movement of sympathy within the ambit of "natural sentiment," Hume is obliged to interpret the sign as a sign of the other's pain or pleasure. This needs to revised, in light of the all of the ways just enumerated in which the affective process triggered by the sign overspills the hedonic dimension of experience.
