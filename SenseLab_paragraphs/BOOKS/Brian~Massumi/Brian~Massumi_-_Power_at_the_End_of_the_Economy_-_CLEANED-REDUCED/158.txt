The sign of the other that triggers this affective process and its passional playing-out has a double sense, corresponding to the two tensions, that of the arising of a field of overfull potential, and between that arising and its resolving playing-out. What the SIGN OF THE OTHER stands for points in two directions. On the one hand, it points to the ACTUATED LANDSCAPE OF POTENTIAL just described. This is not the landscape that the other inhabits. It is NOT ANOTHER'S HOME TERRITORY. Rather, IT IS THE LANDSCAPE THAT INHABITS THE OTHER: the array of co-present passions and tendential action-perceptions actuated by the sign the other emits. The landscape of potential does not inhabit the other so much as it comes between the other and me, actuated in the communication of affectability that moves instantaneoulsy from the other to me, and in the so moving directly moves me. IT INHABITS THIS MOVING RELATION. The moving-relation is in the hyphen of the dividual-transindividual: my life is braced into bare activity by the transindividual movement of transition. The strike in the infra- of the dividual and the trans-affection from the other are one: two instantaneous poles of same relational movement.
