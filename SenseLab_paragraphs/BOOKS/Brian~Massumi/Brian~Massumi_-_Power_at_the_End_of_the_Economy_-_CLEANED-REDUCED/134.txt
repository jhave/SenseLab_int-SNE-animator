There is NO MEDIATION by the faculty of reason involved in the thinking-feeling process of sympathy. No subject of interest steps in. There is just the inventive complexity of the perceptual event, passing through me on the way to further transitions. The workings of reason come after the perception's genesis and the generative event, in the reflections of the philosopher in a moment of pause, or perhaps in the reflections of the person who was affected in all immediacy and now thinks back on the encounter at a remove. In the latter case, reason can inflect the process only if the thinking included in the feeling was for some reason off the mark. After all, "external signs" can be ambiguous. One way the process goes off the mark is when the perceived effect in the other's countenance or conversation that triggers the sympathetic process is erroneously attributed to the wrong object. For example, you might hurt someone by something you say, but you misconstrue which comment it was that caused the affection. The other way an error occurs is when the tendency that arises with the newly minted passion falls into the wrong groove, so that it is insufficient as a means of effecting the empassioned transition (Hume 1984, 2.3.3, 463). These errors are "false judgments"â€”FALSE PERCEPTUAL JUDGMENTS.31 Reason's only role is a reflective corrective to false perceptual judgments.
Hume has no patience for the standard rhetoric of the "COMBAT OF PASSION AND REASON" (Hume 1984, 3.1.3, 460-462). How could they enter into hand-to-hand combat when they really don't even touch? Reason holds itself at a reflective remove from the inventive life-process that comes flush with perception. Because of this, reason has no motive force. That is why it can't dictate that I should not prefer disaster for an other to a scratch on my little finger, or that I should not prefer my own pain to pleasure, potentially acting to the benefit of far-away other against my own self-interests.
