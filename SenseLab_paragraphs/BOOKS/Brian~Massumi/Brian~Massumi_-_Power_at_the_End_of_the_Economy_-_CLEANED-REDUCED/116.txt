We catch the frisbee because of this capacity of perceptual judgment. But not only perceptual judgment. We also rely on perceptual judgment's capacity to extrapolate itself into a perception not just of what is presently occurring, but of what is coming next. We abductively live out the intuitive hypothesis of where the frisbee is wafting, shifting our posture and position on the fly in attunements with the disc's modulations, all as smoothly as the wind. When we catch the frisbee, in spite of the incalculable complexity of its chance-inflected flight path, what we have done is to effectively perceive chance (Massumi 2014). Strevens calls this "tychomancy" (the divining of chance). 
What humans can do that dogs cannot is to extrapolate further, into theoretical constructs capturing the perception of chance for science, and its signature activity of regularizing results. Strevens studies in depth the central role of "physical intuition" in such scientific advances as Maxwell's discovery of the probability distribution of the molecular movement of gases. This discovery laid the foundation for "statistical mechanics, this theoretical scaffold that now supports a great part of all physical inquiry" (Strevens 2013, 7). In other words, the capacity of science to operationalize probabilities is actually an outgrowth of intution's abductive prowess. Can not the same be said of statistics as a whole? However, the more general and abstract the realm of probability, the more extenuated becomes the role of perceptual judgment, to the point that it is all but lost in domains of such large-scale, open-system complexity as the economy.
