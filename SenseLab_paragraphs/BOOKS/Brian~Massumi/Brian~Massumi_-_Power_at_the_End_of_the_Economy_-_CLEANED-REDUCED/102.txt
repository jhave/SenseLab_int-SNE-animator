Take this example of how a presuppositional field works, loosely based on the work of linguist Oswald Ducrot (Ducrot 1980, 69-101). You enter a field without noticing a rather crucial detail in the situational conditions: there's a bull at the other end. The moment the bull makes it presence felt, before you have had time to think consciously, even to the extent of registering the bull in a fully formed act of recognition, you are BRACED. You are braced into the necessity of living out the situation, for better or for worse. You have no choice about that. You're in it. Your life is entirely absorbed in the immediacy of the brewing event. You're taken into the incipience of an event you have no power to decide not to participate in. But the event has not yet played out, so there may be ways it might be inflected that will make a differenceâ€”one as fundamental as the difference between health and injury or even life and death. As you are braced into the event, the field changes. It becomes a FIELD OF POTENTIAL.
