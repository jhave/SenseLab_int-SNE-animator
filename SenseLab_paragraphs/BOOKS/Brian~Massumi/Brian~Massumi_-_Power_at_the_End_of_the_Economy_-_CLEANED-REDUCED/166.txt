Happiness economics responds to this by purporting to have discovered "the happiness equation" (Powdthavee 2010, 11). The happiness equation is a method for putting a MONETARY PRICE ON THE INTANGIBLES of experience from which we derive satisfaction. These are, in the main, modes of relation that we consider to the quality of our lives to hinge on, and to define "who we are" more than what we do for a living. Friendship and comaraderie, love and life-partnering, and personal health are at the top of the list. If economics can manage to quantify these relational values, it will have achieved the conversion of the citizen into an effectively satisfaction-fueled subject of interest, and of qualitative surplus-value of life into quantitative surplus-value. It will have completed the MONETIZATION OF EXISTENCE that is the project of human-capital. Affectivity will finally be subsumed to rational calculation. Unfortunately for these latter-day prophets of neoliberalism, outside economics and aside from its popularizing cheer-leaders, as few believe in this "equation" as believe in the well-groundedness of rational-choice theory.
