Each dizzy individual's rabbit-hole of affect is at the immanent limit of the economy. The multitude of these regressive endpoints "communicate," entangled at distance. Their transindividual entanglement composes what Deleuze and Guattari would call the "PLANE OF IMMANENCE" OF THE ECONOMY. The plane of immanence of the economy is the irreducibly affective limit of a complexly relational field. It is the economy at its absolute co-motional limit of tendential stirrings in uncertain readiness potential.
