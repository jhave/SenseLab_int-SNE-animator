For any structure of rationality to produce a regularity of results, and on that basis to settle in and make itself indispensable, it cannot in point of fact completely filter out what it brands as "irrational." For technoscience, the "irrational" boils down to uncontrolled complexity-effects, and the intuitions of perceptual judgment and abduction which alone are capable of fielding them. As science studies has amply shown, the everyday practice of science does not in fact suppress the superposition of modes of activity found at the germinal level of any and all action-perception. Laboratory life is a "mangle of practice"—a site of complex "intertwinements" among a plurality of active factors (Pickering 1995, 23). The "mangle" is irreducibly relational. Active factors mutually "capture" each other, in an emergent "reciprocal tuning" (20). This differential attunement gives the lie to any simple notion of intentionality, understood as a calculated rational choice exercised by an individual decider (17-20). Every rational structure is rationalizing. It is rationalizing in both senses of the word. First, in the sense that the construction of its edifice resides on the shifting ground of the mutual inclusion of modes of activity whose "reciprocal tuning" cannot be considered rational as a whole—but from whose unspecified whole rational results are procedurally extracted. Second, in the sense that it must excuse itself of this germinal sin of relational openness by explaining the mangle away (think of the scandalized reaction on the part of many scientists to science studies's poking its nose into the relational complexity of the everyday workings of the laboratory). Rationalizations aside, the mangle cannot not be negotiated, in order for any enduring settlement to be arrived at. Yet for reasons of institutional pride of place (i.e., for purposes of power-positioning in the larger relational field), the guards of the tribunal of reason are duty-bound to occult it, or at least background it.
