Scholium. Ontopower operates by preemption. Preemptive operations dip into the field of emergence, taking the co-motional potential stirring there as their object. This is potential that has not yet taken determinate form. It is flush with the field of emergence. There is a margin of indeterminacy as to which existing modes of existence it might feed, or what forms of life it may emerge into. It is proto-formal: still a formative force whose conclusion is not foregone. It remains highly charged with the force of futurity. Because of this ontological indecision, the form-takings that will eventuate are struck with a high level of contingency. This makes the pokings of potential by preemptive mechanisms far less directive than normative channellings. Preemption flushes out takings-form of life potential. It is incitatory, piggy-backing on the movements of emergence astir in the field. On the systemic level of neoliberal capitalism, these formative movements are captured in the fluid, eddying, ontogenetic (becomingful) form of human capital. There is much to be said about preemption that exceeds the limits of this series of theses. Suffice it to say that preemption cannot be glossed over, and also must be grappled with, through the invention of counter- ontopowers.
