Scholium a. A surplus-value, it was said earlier, is an emergent effect that is relational: it comes of the singular way a multiplicity of contributory elements come together to spin off a collective effect. The effect has a quality of it own that it owes, genetically, to the qualitative differentials between its conditioning elements. But it does not reproduce those differences. It spins off into its own singular character. The singularity of the emergent effect is not reducible to the contributory parts, even in aggregate. It is more than the sum of its formative parts. It is in self-additive excess over them. The emergent excess-effect's singular quality brings to expression the intensity of its contributory factors' coming-together: it culminates the playing out of the tension inherent in their qualitative differentials. It expresses, in and as its own emergence, the way that the tension holds more potential in itself than the linear causal connections among the contributory elements could ever claim credit for. This is a creative tension. The contributing elements can, of course, be numbered. But it is not their quantity per se that has intensity. It is their manner of coming integrally together in number that has an intensity. The intensity expresses itself in a supplementation of their number: the emergence of an excess-effect. The expression of intensity is supernumerary. It is important to hold onto the idea that intensity does not express itself. It is expressed in an emergent quality that supervenes upon (comes self-creatively in addition to) the contributing factors' number, and which counts as one on its own account, in the manner in which it singularly affirms its own character. "The many become one and are increased by one" (Whitehead 1978, 2).
