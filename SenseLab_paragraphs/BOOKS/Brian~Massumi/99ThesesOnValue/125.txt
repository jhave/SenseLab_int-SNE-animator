Scholium d. The differentials whose tension spins off an integral affect as an emergence-effect registering the intensity of the field, immanent to its event, affect each other. Otherwise, they would not be in tension, and nothing would play out. In the weather example, the friction between particles, rays and refractions of light, streams of wind, water evaporation, heat concentration and dissipation that spin off into an affective registering of their field of co-occurrence, register each other. It is their registerings of each other that is integrated into the global feeling registering the overall movement of the weather event they co-compose. The friction between particles registers heat, evaporation registers heat concentration, heat concentrations register rays of light, wind currents dissipate heat. Affect figures on this level independent of the human. This is nonhuman experience. This nonhuman experience re-figures in our experience, through the added difference of our affect's singularity. That singularity integrally envelops the multiplicity of the nonhuman affects. It is both monadic (as is each enveloped sub-affect), and constitutively open: it can only bring the field to this singular expression because it is formatively immersed in it, arising from a participation in it.
