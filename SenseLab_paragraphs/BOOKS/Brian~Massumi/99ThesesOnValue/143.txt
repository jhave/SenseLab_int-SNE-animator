Scholium. The term "event-derivative" is a synonym for surplus-value of life. An event-derivative is an affective registering of a field of emergence. It expresses the field's complexity, immanent to that field. It integrally envelops the field's intensity in its own difference, resonating with what it envelops. In doing so, it gives the field an immanent emphasis, like a peak rising from rugged foothills rolling to the tides of the distant sea. An event-derivative stands salient, without separation. For example, the affect composed of seasonableness, comfort, the sense of the passage of time, the bodily spring reawakening, the hint of the hunkering down for winter, that registers the singularity of a weather event are lived qualities expressing that occurrence of the state of the weather in the currency (or better, fluency) of experience. This surplus- value of life does not have the same form or content as the factors composing the conditions of emergence from which it derives (friction between particles, etc.). It envelops its conditions of emergence, and remains wrapped up with them, directly sharing in their event. But at the same time, it adds an affective dimension that asserts its difference in nature from them. It has its own quality, like the verticality of the peak in contrast to the horizontality of the plain that supports its standing out. The qualitative difference of the surplus-value of life is the differential feeling tone of the state of the weather: in and of it, but not it. An event-derivative, as surplus-value of life, is an emergent qualitative difference that both envelops and is enveloped by its conditions of emergence. It is an immersive effect. It is a participatory peak. It remains in the qualitative register, in its own emphatic way.
