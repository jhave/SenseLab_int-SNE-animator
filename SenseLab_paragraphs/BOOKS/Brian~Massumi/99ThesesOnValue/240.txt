Scholium d. It is important not to forget the complexities of the vocabulary around affect and intensity, and to keep sight of the role of qualitative differentials (in the starling example, the differentials of flying style between the individual birds in the flock, as indexed by variations in speed, acceleration, and spacing between bodies, composing the flock's overall manner of flying). In the light of the contrast between intensive magnitude and affective intensity, intensity can be used as a shorthand for affective intensity, since the term intensive magnitude takes on the role it can otherwise have of referring to the way the quantitative and the qualitative have of coming together.
