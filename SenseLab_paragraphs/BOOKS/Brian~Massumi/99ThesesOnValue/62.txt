Scholium. With sharing economies, the notion of fair exchange is reattached to the time element. There is no formal unit of measure, no formal medium of exchange, and no store of value. And yet, there is inevitably an informal calculation of equivalence, bearing on how much time goes into the services exchanged, or into developing the competence behind the necessary skills. In the absence of a formal currency, time itself becomes the informal currency. This retains capitalism's fundamental labor equation, time = money. It actually attempts to make it more honest and live up to its own word by sidelining the exploitative element of profit. It brings into visibility that economic exchange is predicated on the capture of life-time, thus validating one of capitalism's basic mechanisms, while attempting to counteract its oppressive effects.
