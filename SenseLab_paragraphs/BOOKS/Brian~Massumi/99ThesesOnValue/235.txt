own expression. Insistency is a question of qualitative emphasis. A greater pain is not less qualitative: it is more insistently purely qualitative. Its qualitative intensity, it is true, rises and falls in lockstep with the number of factors involved. But "as soon as we try to measure it, we unwittingly replace it by space" (Bergson 2001, 106). Measure translates the intensity of the quality into spatial extension â€“ which, of course, it cannot in actuality come without, even if, in the event, it cannot be reduced to it. When we measure, we are toggling between two necessary dimensions, intensity and extension, that are mutually enveloped in the event. Measure is a technique for treating those dimensions as separable. Separating the dimensions takes the intensity out of the event. Its extensive aspect is measured, and the numbers thus extracted from the event are moved into in another event-domain, where they function as indexes of the event and its inherent intensity.
