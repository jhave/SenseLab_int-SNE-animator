2008). Its superimposition onto the nation-state structure annexes notions of ethnicity to the model of masculinity. The result is a racism as, if not more intense, than the misogyny that goes along with the masculinisit supremacism. The proto-fascist quality of this formation inheres in its powers of contagion: its power of unregulated becoming. This proliferative power makes the alt-right a strange alloy of the classical disciplinary regime and ontopower; of extreme top- down oppression, unleashed from traditional standards of moral uprightness, and emergent primary resistance. It is beyond the scope of these theses to plunge further into this morass, in a way that would do justice to its creativity and complexities. No alter-economic project, however, can afford to ignore it. No account of the ecology of powers can dispense with an analysis of proto-fascism and fascism: this short gloss is meant only as a placeholder for that analysis.
