Scolium c. In this example, the greater number corresponded to the greater intensity. This is generally but not necessarily the case. Intensity fundamentally has to do with the qualitative range of the potential enveloped, and its ability to insist on itself: to make itself presently palpable. A small number of elements may mutually cohere in movement in a way that envelops a greater intensity of potential than a larger number of the same kind of elements, depending on the nature of the elements and the manner of their concertation. This is due to the fact that the contributory sub-tendencies insist on themselves, as well as their integral expression insisting on itself, and the quality of the global expression is modulated as a function of that. To return to the pain example, it is well known that anxious tensing increases the intensity of pain, and that the cultivation of certain "mindful" counter-tendencies of attention decreases it. The relation between extension and intensity is not linear. Tendencies go all the way down qualitatively, and their differentials make a difference at every level.
