Scholium a. The generation of capitalist surplus-value through the wage relation is the classic example of leveraging, taken in the broadest sense as the extraction of a relational more-than. The excess of value skimmed off from the work process is more than a simple equation between the cost of the labor time put in and the market price of the resulting product. It arises from an intensification of the labor process: from increasing "productivity" so as to gain "competitive edge." It is the differential in productivity between a given enterprise and its competitors that yields surplus-value. The means employed to carve out this differential is what Marx referred to as the "extortion" inherent in the wage relation.
