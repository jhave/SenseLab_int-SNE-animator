Scholium a. The contemporary function of resurgent normation is to try to moderate, if not stave off, the relativizing power of biopower's normative drift and the deregulating drive of neoliberal capitalist ontopower. Even more so, their aim is to stanch the escape from capitalist ontopower back toward the primary resistance of self-rewilding surplus-value of life. The processual intensification – the increase in powers of self-driving, or autonomization –is a trauma and a horror to normativity. It is passionately an affront to normation-based modes of life. But it is not without its horror for biopolitical normativity as well. Normation-based archaisms with a contemporary function are reaction-formations to what neoliberal capitalism's creative destruction has unleashed. Such developments as the rise of the religious right in the United States, to name just one of the fundamentalist movements agitating all of the world's religions (now even Buddhism, as seen in Myanmar), are reaction- formations against neoliberalism which take a moralizing route: the affirmation of other-worldly values underwriting a rigid image of the upright moral character.
