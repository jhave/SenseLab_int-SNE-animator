Scholium. The qualitative order concerns singular sets of circumstances, whereas orders built upon quantification concern general ideas. General ideas are those which subsume more than one singularity under a single umbrella and apply themselves equally to each, in such a way as to sweep them up together into different systems circuits. This was seen in the way the same temperature reading applied equally to the two qualitatively different states of the weather. General ideas are by no means all quantitative, but systematic quantification always generalizes.
