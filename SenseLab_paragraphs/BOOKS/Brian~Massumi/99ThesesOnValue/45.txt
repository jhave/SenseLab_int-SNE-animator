Scholium. Capital is a time-function. The time element is fundamentally non- chronological, revolving around potential, which is nothing other than futurity in the present. It only secondarily concerns the measure of time. Primarily, it concerns time as the qualtiative interval priming the actualization of potential. Speculation is not a perversion of the capitalist economy. It is of its essence. It is its power function. Capital is the economic lever of the time of potential. As such, it captures the future of vitality: life's qualitatively-in-the-making. It captures potential. In this capacity, capital operates directly as a mechanism of power. Its economic functioning cannot be separated from its power function. To say that capitalism is a power over life is an understatement. It is a capture of life's in-the-making, its very becoming (it is an "ontopower." Capitalism economizes life, and it is this economization that directly constitutes a formation of power.
