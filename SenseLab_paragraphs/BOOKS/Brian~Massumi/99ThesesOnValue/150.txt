This conversion cycle drives the individual life as human capital. The profit made is not all spent, but more importantly invested. This feeds it forward into capitalism's self-driving. The feedback between the drive of human capital and capitalism's self- driving annexes the life of the individual to the capitalist process, as a quantized subset of it. It pools the individual life as an eddy in the great capitalist stream. The individual life is now a degree of capitalist power participating in capitalism's systemic power to animate itself (it's self-driving dynamism; its machinic vitalism).
