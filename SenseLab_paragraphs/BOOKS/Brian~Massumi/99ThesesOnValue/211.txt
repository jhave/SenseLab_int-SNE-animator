Scholium a. There may well be different understandings of personhood, constructed according to other principles, for example along animist principles, as articulated in contemporary anthropology in relation to indigeneous cultures (Viveiros de Castro 2014; Kohn 2013). These only exist in a systematic way in noncapitalist societies. However, in a certain way they are very much with us in capitalist culture: as prefigured in forms of escape, ephemeral and precarious, bidding for the noncapitalist future. More sustainable alter-personhoods, having more consistency but still escaping pre-formating and retaining a certain animism, will have to be invented as for the postcapitalist world. Logical tools for this from within Western culture exist in the work of C.S. Peirce and A.N. Whitehead. Alter-personhoods embrace their self- driving subjectivity-without-a-subject.
