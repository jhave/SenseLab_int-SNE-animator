â€” Speculative strategy i. The digital. The digital merits inclusion on the list of dangers to ward off to the extent that it lends itself to forming social or cultural bubbles fearful of the outside. A digital platform is necessary, of course, to implement a cryptocurrency (more on which below). But if the digital platform is considered the process, rather than a platform of relation through which the process phase-shifts, a closed culture, and the accompanying entropy, can quickly set in. The digital platform would be conceived as a pivot for the process, spinning off creative energies into off- line collaborative events. The archival action-traces of the events would be returned to the online archive. They would then be dynamized by procedures, both automated and manual, designed to render them anarchival: apt to reactivate as forerunner conditioning factors for events to come. The off-line events would be where the surplus-value of life would be most intensely lived. The self-affirming value produced by the process would revolve around the production of embodied surplus- value of event. The digital platform would be the technical engine of the creative procress, but not its experiential heart. The relation between the digital platform and the off-line events spinning off from it would be transductive. By transductive is meant the continuing of a process across phase-shifts moving the process from one qualitatively different differential field of emergence to another, each hosting their own qualitative differentials and manners of taking-form.
