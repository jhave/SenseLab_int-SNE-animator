The secondary debt market performs the capitalist magic trick of making debt a credit instrument, in ways far more powerful (leverageable) than simple interest-bearing capital. The very distinction between an asset and a liability is erased at this meta- level of capital, along with the significance of the distinction between productive and unproductive economic activity. At this level, capital is effectively self-abstracting from the "real" economy. Financial capital can never untether itself entirely from the productive economy. But the fact that under neoliberalism it is the leading economic sector (the value of the financial markets far exceeds that of the productive economy) is highly significant. The emphasis on financial capital is in fact one of the key defining characteristics of neoliberalism. The neoliberal economy is increasingly anchored in the tendential unanchoring of financial capital from the productive economy. The tables have turned, to the point that it is the productive economy that might more accurately be considered secondary to financial capital. The two realms of the capitalist economy still revolve around each other, but the power relation has shifted, turned upside down. This self-turning of capitalism on its head vastly increases volatility â€¦ which only further feeds the ability to game surplus-value of flow, actually strengthening the financial sector, which up until now has been able to skate past the periodic crises that inevitably result. The work horse of industrial capital has been displaced by the cat of financial capital. Neoliberalism repeatedly throws the economy into air, trusting it to land back on its feet (onto the backs of the self-acting mules it rides).
