Scholium. As Marx famously said, the postcapitalist future will grow in the pores of the capitalist field of life. This resonates with what today is called prefigurative politics (the idea that our resistances to capital and power today must endeavor to embody embryonically the qualities that will characterize the postcapitalist future), The immediate task is to craft temporary autonomous zones that might release postcapitalist potential into the wild, to proliferate. These are not just vacuoles. They are full of hyperdifferentiation: a plethora of qualitative differentials in creative tension. They are not disorganized, but rather full to overflowing with alter- organization. (The concept of alter-economic temporary autonomous zone as connected to the revaluation of values envisioned here is in dialogue with the original term [Bey 2003], but with differences of approach and emphasis, particularly as regards creative duplicity)
