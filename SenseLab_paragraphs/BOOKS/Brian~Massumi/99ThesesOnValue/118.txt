Scholium c. Systems run on synergies: emergent, relational effects that raise a system's operation to a higher power. This is called efficiency. Efficiency is the intensification of a system through the production of a surplus-value of interaction between its parts that is carefully contained within the system's internal circuit of operations (this is why we tend to speak in terms of efficiency "boosts"). This internalizing capture of intensity is what gives systems their vitality. It is their life- line. It is their metabolism. It runs them. In capturing intensity, systems are availing themselves of processual potentials. They are systematically dipping into process, to boost their internal functioning. The annulment of intensity is never total. The annulment of intensity is the mark of its appropriation.
