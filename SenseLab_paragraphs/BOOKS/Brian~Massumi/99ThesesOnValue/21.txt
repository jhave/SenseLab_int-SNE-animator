Scholium a. Everyone knows that fluctuations internal to the operations of the market fundamentally hinge on a certain privileged non-economic factor: affect. Markets run on fear and hope, confidence and insecurity. Affect is and remains an "externality," but what exactly does that mean? It cannot mean that affect is a factor that is squarely outside the scope of the economy. That would be to underestimate its constitutive force in market dynamics, and to deny the long shadow it has cast over the discipline of economics from the beginning. Did not Keynes warn his fellow economists in his then-maturing field against the "underestimation of the concealed factors of utter doubt, precariousness, hope and fear" (Keynes 1973, 122)? Concealed â€“ or not so concealed, but nevertheless officially disavowed. Affect cannot be considered to be squarely outside the market, but neither is it a formal market mechanism that is recognized as inside its system. It is not an economic operator per se. It has its own nature, and modus operandi, and they are qualitative. Affect qualitatively agitates the economy, but it also overspills it, extending to many a non-economic arena. It forces itself upon economic calculations, but is not one itself. Market functions feel its force. It makes its mark economically, while remaining of another nature, in excess-over.
