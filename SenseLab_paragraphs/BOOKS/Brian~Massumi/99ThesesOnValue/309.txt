â€” Speculative strategy j. Transactional exchange. Smart contracts would be used internally for easing into the collaboration and communicating the relational ethos of the varietal culture to newcomers. They would not be contracts in the traditional sense, but more like process movers. For example, they could be used as gateways that organize a participant's getting to know the process and being welcomed into it. This would avoid the heavy-handed disciplinary gesture of requiring acquiescence to a formal set of rules as a conditon of entry (the widely used strategy that is the digital equivalent of the outmoded "social contract" so much a part of liberal democracy). They could also be used to crystallize activity and attention around emergent propositions, and to nudge them over the threshold into an eventful taking-form. In this capacity, they would replace the formal "governance" structures built into blockchain and post-blockchain projects, even the most alter-economic in inspiration. There would be no membership, no formal vetting of newcomers, and no structured- in unequal distribution of power (for example, between newcomers and oldtimers, even founders). The danger of trolls and willful destroyers would be assumed as a risk of adventure. Again, if the project died for lack of adequate immune response to these threats, its disseminative nature would mean it could always re-seed itself elsewhere. It would be designed to be self-grafting, rather than self-preserving and self-reproducing. The fusional process driving it would carry fissile potential.
