Scholium. The full complexity of the conditions of the event from which the quantity is extracted is funneled down to a single, simple figure. There is an essential excess of difference, complexity, process, flow, and co-motion on the side of the qualitative which is never entirely absorbed into quantitative ordering. There is much that escapes conversion. There is a left-over of changeable qualities, of liveliness, that does not count, and remains unaccounted for. This can be analyzed under the concept of bare activity. When the terms "qualitative field of life" or "field of emergence" are used, they are referring to the immanence of the co-motion of bare activity to the actions (discrete operations) fed by its systematic capture, and connoting that differential. New kinds of complexity can be built on quantification and systematization, but these are of another order, leading away from the immediacy of the event, and the bare activity formatively stirring it, into other domains.
