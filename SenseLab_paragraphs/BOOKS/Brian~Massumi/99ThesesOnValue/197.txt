Scholium. Attempts to revive the figure of the individual as responsible member of civil society embodying norms of "pro-social" behavior (the "tolerant neighbor," the "decent citizen") are also reaction-formations to the quasi-chaos of the excessive self- driving of the capitalist process under neoliberalism. They are not as rigidly moral as their religious-right nemeses, but still qualify as disciplinary. They oppose a soft disciplinarity to right's hard discipline. They take the normative ethics route of inculcating a "good" disposition. Liberalism works more by gently molding the character than outright modeling it, as moralistic normation does. It appeals and appeases, strokes and pats on the back, to mold the social putty of the individual into the kind of well-regulated behavior in the public sphere that shores up the correspondingly well-regulated behavior of the liberal democratic state. Liberalism tries to stabilize the biopolitical bell curve by suspending good-conduct weights from the top of the curve to prevent it from wobbling so much, so as to hold it better in place. This is meant to function as well to stanch the flow of primary resistance, channeling away from the radical temptation of extra-parliamentary contestation and from the exhuberance of the form of rewilding that goes by the name of queer, back into the well-oiled electoral wheels of the normative nation-state. The liberal nation- state is supple enough that it can try to coax these escapes back into its fold, by adding a special normative dispensation (for example gay marriage and other newly-won recognized rights), rather than stamping them out outright. These are soft captures.
