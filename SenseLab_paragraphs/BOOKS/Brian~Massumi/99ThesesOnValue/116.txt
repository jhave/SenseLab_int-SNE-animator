Scholium b. The primary mechanism for the annulment of intensity is the undue explanatory trust conferred upon quantification: the mistaken belief that the count of a field of emergence's participating elements can be explanatorily substituted for their creative tension. Attempting to grasp intensity and the potential it harbours through quantitative analysis amounts to miscontruing the immanent outside as external: as an exterior standing in opposition to an interior. This in turn amounts to eliding the difference between processual ecology and systemic environment. In a systemic environment, elements and operations can be treated as units, singled out and recombined, enabling counting and quantitative analysis. The systemic mobilization of quantification gives it awesome power. It builds this power by capitalizing on intensity, even as it explanatorily annuls it.
