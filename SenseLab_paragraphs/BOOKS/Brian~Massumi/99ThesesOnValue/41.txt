Scholium c. The capitalist system is characterized by its relentless drive for growth. Growth is capitalism's processual desire: its constitutive tendency (what Nietzsche would call its will to power). The surplus-value drive to excess-over gives the capitalist economy its dynamic quality of ever-moreness, for once and for all-over- again, in perpetual turnover. The engine of surplus-value lies at the beating heart of the capitalist system and dilates its veins. It is the expansive diastole for profit's systolic contraction. More than the quality of money – that is it how appears when considered from inside the system – surplus-value is the processual quality of the capitalist system. It what gives its quantifications their dynamic quality. It is the processual subjectivity of the capitalist system, self-absorbed in the generation of the numerical objectifications that feed its formal operations. It is how capitalism dips into the expanded field of its immanent outside (diastole), no sooner to contract the movements of potential found there into its profit-making system flow (systole).
