Scholium. The idea that salary is a fair exchange of a quantity of money for a quantity of life-time and bodily activity is identified by Marx as the foundational myth of capitalism. If this is an equal exchange, what is "profit"? Profit is an excess of the value the worker produces over and above the value of the money invested in his or her salary. Although the revaluation of value will also have to transcend the Marxian labor theory of value (among other reasons, because its critique is still articulated in quantitative terms, even though it points to the qualitative oppression of the "theft" of vitality), this dramatically gives the lie to capitalism's assertion that its system functions on a basis of equal exchange, or value for value. Reducing the "cost of labor" is a rallying cry for those in a position to use money in another of its roles, backgrounded by its three-fold market definition: money as the vehicle of investment. What is this cry to reduce labor costs, if not a heart-felt call to preserve, or widen, the inequality of the salary "exchange"? That inequality is presupposed by the vehemence of the call, even if it is disavowed in the accompanying explanatory rhetoric of "fair compensation." The antagonism between the capitalist's "fair compensation" and the worker's "fair wage" says it all. The unequal exchange of life-time and vital energies for the price of a salary demonstrates that in its investment heart-of-hearts capitalism runs as much on excess and incommensurability as it does in the market arena of consumer exchange.
