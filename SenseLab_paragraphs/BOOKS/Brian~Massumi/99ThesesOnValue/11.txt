Scholium. This definition actually skirts the issue of value. Since the "store of value" is nothing more than a quantity of units of account held in reserve, the definition is circular. The circularity spreads the concept of value across the three roles, equating it with the ability of money to phase between them. The result is an obfuscation of value, both of how it actually functions in capitalism – which cannot be reduced to classical market mechanisms and the market's central concept of exchange – and of what it might become in a revalued postcapitalist future.
