Scholium d. Financial capital is the epitome of capital, carrying what it can do, as driver of surplus-value, to the limit. In the neoliberal economy, the financial sector takes off from the "real" economy. It unleashes surplus-value of flow at the meta- level, declaring its independence from the "underlying assets" of the productive economy. Financial capital's autonomization of surplus-value of flow takes the form of derivatives such as options, hedging, and credit default swaps. With options and hedging, profit is made from speculating on ups and downs of the movements of underlying assets, capitalizing on volatility itself. With credit default swaps, secondary financial instruments are constructed by dividing and recombining existing assets ("tranching"). The idea is that a strategic mix is more secure than an unbundled collection of the same assets, because the lowest-grade assets can default without bringing the whole house of cards falling down (this is "securitization"). With the trading of the bundled assets, a new tier of assets has been created, in a wholly derivative way, without anything new being produced â€“ aside from the ability of the new financial instrument to circulate independently. The value of the derivative can fluctuate in a way that is largely unanchored not only from the ownership of any underlying assets, but also from their individual valuations (Bryan/Rafferty 2006, 10-13, 18, 37, 52, 66, 75, 129, 154, 184). In reality, the underlying "assets" are not necessarily assets in any normal sense of the term. In the case of credit default swaps, they are debts (mortgages, car loans, and student loans being the prime examples).
