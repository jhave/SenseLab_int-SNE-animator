We can sum up the "subjective, vital" factors that are called "externalities" with the word "affect." Affect is a name for factors that make their mark on market dynamics while overspilling them, that modulate economic logic without belonging to it as such. A better way to capture affect's fraught status than to say that it is an externality is to say that it is the market's immanent outside. This term points to the fact that there are factors that belong to capitalism's field but do not belong to its system. It is to the immanent outside of capitalism that the revaluation of values must look to identify qualitative processes in embryonic form that might grow a postcapitalist future. The question of affect is closely related to the concept of intensity, which is a key to understanding the relation between the qualitative and the quantitative in economic terms.
