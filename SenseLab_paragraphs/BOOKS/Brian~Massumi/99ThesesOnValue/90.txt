Scolium c. An individual is human capital to the extent that it manages to locally embody the overall movement of capital. The individual dips into the flow in such a way as to fashion its person as a miniaturization of the overall movement. Its life- activity becomes a quantum of capitalist surplus-value, to its self-driving core. Its job is to surf the movements of capital: to make itself competitive across the successive waves of the rapidly changing job market, or as an independent entrepreneur (the preferred choice for "millennials" who are in the loop). This life-surfing fashions the individual as an ambulant personification of surplus-value of flow. The individual's job description is its life description: to strategically play the qualitative differentials that compose its field of life. These include, among others, the differentials between leisure-time and work-time, skill development and the application of acquired knowledge, friendship and networking, discipline and improvisation, energizings and replenishment, immediate satisfaction and tactical deferral. A fundamental task is to glean surplus-value of information and leverage it. But producing surplus-value of perception is also involved, not to mention surplus-value of sociality â€“ a whole spread of qualitatively different surplus-values. The dynamic bundling of these different surplus-values composes the integral surplus-value-of-life that characterizes the individual as human capital. It is ultimately this surplus-value of life that is captured by the capitalist process. A unit of human capital is a quantum of surplus-value of life subsumed under the overall movement of capital as a function of its own dynamic self-driving. One is captured by one's own perpetual movement of self-fashioning.
