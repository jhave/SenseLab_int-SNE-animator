Scholium b. As the variety of the tendencies churn through the continuity of the event, their differentials play out into a singular affective expression: that of the global quality marking the culmination of the event.

That rhythm is the immanent dynamic form (the self-in-forming) of the event. It is the dynamic form of a subjectivity-without-a-subject.
