Call it "Space." The economic spaces would buttress each other: each would contribute a portion of the value they minted to the spaces around it, encouraging cooperation. The environment would be designed for symbiosis rather than competition. To complete the complex open system design of the environment of alter-economic spaces, there would be an underlying cryptocurrency that Space would link with. Call it "Gravity." Gravity would participate in the burgeoning cryptocurrency market, providing an outlet through which the economic spaces co-habiting the alter-economic environment could interface with Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, or national currencies, using Space as a transitional medium. This would create the possibility for the Occurrency minted by the creative process engine to be converted to cash value, on an as-needed basis. In this way, the project could provision itself with the goods and services it had no choice but to source from the dominant economy, but which it needed to fuel its self-driving on its own processual terms (travel, food, and accommodation for participants in the off-line events, materials, etc.). The resulting economy would be an economy of abundance, because its "underlying" would be activity, and the activity, though fluctuating, would be ongoing. It would be the force of its continuing that would be harnessed. The economization would bear on the power of the continuum: a self-renewing plenum of subjective becoming, rather than an objective scarcity of resources.
