activity, as the capitalist economy as a whole. A quantum of human capital is actually less a separate subset than a fractal region. Since it is as manically self-driving as the overall movement that is the capitalist system as a whole, it runs on excess energies, and its excess energies can run away with it. The paradox of capitalism (speaking here specifically of neoliberal capitalism) is that its regulatory interventions in the field of life are wont to overspill, spinning off, as if by design, deregulated, even aberrant, movements â€“ escapes. Its exercises of biopower are applied as-if in order to overspill into ontopower. They give the field of life a healthy modicum of stability that prevents the escapes from tipping over into irrecuperable crisis, or from heading off in postcapitalist directions. Ontopower takes processual precedence over biopower, with its intensified powers of production: its power to flush life out, boosting it into taking its own form, inciting it to self-produce as human capital (the word "produce" here takes on similar connotations as carried by the word "producer" in the entertainment industry). Human capital is the most direct mode of capture of the movements of excess fostered by ontopower. Biopower is commonly defined as a power over life (bearing on individuals as biosocial beings, and especially on populations of biosocial beings). Ontopower is less a power-over life than it is a power to generate a more of life, a more-than of life. This is another way of saying that it is ontogenetic, a power not over beings but of becoming. Neoliberal capitalism, through its regulatory interventions, multiplies norms. At the same time, it unleashes an overspilling of the norms through its formating of life as human capital.
