2010s in the United States for the $15 a day minimum wage, and the struggles over pension and health benefits playing out in such hot spots in the neoliberal wars as the states of Wisconsin and Illinois in the US, belie any such conclusion, as does the relentlessness push on the part of the Republican Party to increase the already gaping inequality in the system (Picketty 2014) by continuing to redistribute wealth upward to the richest tier. What it means is that the worker-capitalist dialectic no longer structures the capitalist field as a whole. This is precisely because it is an opposition, and oppositions are structural. Capitalism is not a structure. It is a system, constitutively open onto its immanent outside (ultimately, it is a process). An open, process-worthy system has no "whole" ("process-worthy" in the sense we say a ship is sea-worthy). It has global integrations of proliferating differentials. The integration emergently adds itself to the multiplicity of its conditiong factors, which it does not erase, but rather supplements ("the many become one, and are increased by one").
