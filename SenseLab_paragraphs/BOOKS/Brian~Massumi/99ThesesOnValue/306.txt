â€” Speculative strategy h. Incentivization. There would be no incentivization by promises of quantifiable individual gain. The adventure of the ongoing collective self- improvisation would be its own incentive. The process itself would serve as a qualitative attractor for emergent-collectivity production. Attractors orient activity, immanent to a process's self-running, rather subordinate it to goals or pre- programmed results imposed from without. They operate by purely affective means. They do not goad, discipline, channel, obligate, or obviate. They lure. They do not pre-mold or pre-format results. They stir up self-driving tendencies predisposed to move in the direction they indicate, their attractive power inflecting them en route into producing variations on themselves. They are leaveners of event-based taking- form. Attractors are lures for the autonomous self-expression of creative process.
