Scholium c. In captialism, there is is no peak-level integration. Rather than peaking out or plateauing, capitalism's self-integration no sooner weaves itself than it folds back down into its field of emergence. It is in perpetual, self-relating turnover on its own conditions of emergence. In this perpetual subjective becoming, there is no subject "become." To think otherwise would be to hypostasize process (as is done, for example, when "society" is treated as if it were a holistic actant, or existing entity over and above the individuals and other factors composing it; or when a complex, distributed, relational process is treated as a "hyperobject").
