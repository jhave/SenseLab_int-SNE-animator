Classical discipline is much less plastic. It imposes narratives to model the individual in much more rigid ways. Although narrative is always a part of how discipline works, it is not the primary mode in which it operates. It employs narrative (and quantifications) as means among others, adjutant to its primary mode, which is inculcation according to a model rather than channeling as a function of a deformable generic template. Of course, there is always a certain plasticity in narrative, even under a classically disciplinary regime. But in classical discipline, it is incidental. Under neoliberalism, it is pretty much the point.
