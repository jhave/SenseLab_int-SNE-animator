Scholium b. This in-bracing makes all the difference. But the difference it makes cannot be measured, even if the individuals composing the event can be counted. At the infinitesimal level of in-braced potential, incoming into the event, the contrasts between potential movements enter a zone of indistinction where no sooner does one begin to sketch itself than it turns over into another, then that one into yet another, in the churning of potential that is bare activity. The bare activity of the zone of indistinction describes the immanent limit of the field of emergence. At the limit, it zones into the virtual. This  immanent co-motion roils into the continuing of the collective movement, as the pressing of the potentials tumbles over each individual move, and rolls over from one move to the next to globally compose the collective movement. This is the by-now familiar movement of surplus-value production. The in-bracing drives the surplus-value of life of the event (which in this case is also an instance of surplus-value of flow). The rolling over of the surplus-value of the event dynamically fuses the multiplicity of contributing factors into the singular continuing of the event: it produces the event as a continuum. Surplus-value is the power of the continuum.
