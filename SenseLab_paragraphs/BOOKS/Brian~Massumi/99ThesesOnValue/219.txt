Scholium b. An affective analysis is necessary which is beyond the scope of the present account. Such an analysis would have to account for the way in which the Donald-person (or persona) is wholly and completely a media figure â€“ as an immediate mode of existence. What is a media figure in today's field of life? How can it be both a media figure and an immediate mode of existence? A concept of "immediation" will have to be developed to bridge this gap (Manning/Munster/Thomsen forthcoming). The analysis will also have to grapple with the inherent polyvalence of the media figure (another reason why theories of identification don't work). In this case, that polyvalence manifests in the way in which the Donald's deregulated person spins off normativity effects among some followers, while replicating its own monstrosity among others: how he kingpins an oscillation between the normative and the pathological (or sociopathic). The normative swing has to do with the way in which the refractions of self-recognition passing through his media figure rebound on and stoke the reaction-formations discussed earlier, in their more traditional religious-right or rightwing conservative versions. The pathological and sociopathic swing has to do with how these same refractions seed neo-reactionary mini-me monsters. It depends on what soil they fall on (how they fall back on the field of emergence, like fungal spores). The analysis of the Donald as affective-refractor mechanism will hinge on the paradox of the becoming-reactive of affirmative life forces, in potentially so potent a way as to make a veritable contagion, even of the most extreme versionings, a real viral possibility. In other words, the question of fascism, once again, cannot be avoided in any project for the revaluation of values, which can only be predicated on the affirmative becoming-more-intensely- active of formative forces.
