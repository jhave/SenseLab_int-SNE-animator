Having an improvisational edge is what defines play, for these purposes. Play should not be confined to any already-recognized arena conventionally designated as a play space within the existing norms of society. Play deploys to intensest effect in temporary autonomous zones. In addition to the multiplicity of affective intensities produced as it unfolds, participation in an improvisational interaction creates a global surplus-value of life that is lived qualtitatively as a value, and comprises such sub- surplus-values as zest, beauty, wonder, and adventure. These are expressions of Spinozist joy. They accompany the becoming-more-intensely-affirmative of life- formative forces. For Whitehead, the intensity of becoming – "adventure toward novelty" – is the highest "civilizational" value (taking the word civilization with a large grain of twenty-first century salt; Whitehead 1967, viii). To the extent that the collective production of improvised surplus-values of life self-drive an alter- economy, they might be called, tongue firmly in cheek, adventure capital. Adventure capital, having to do as it does with the affirmation of a life-quality, is a directly aesthetic form of value.
