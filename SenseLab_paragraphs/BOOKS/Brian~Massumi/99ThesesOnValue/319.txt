Fact. The SenseLab (www.senselab.ca) has been working on just such a project since early 2016, in collaboration with the developer of Space and Gravity, the Economic Space Agency. The creative-process engine is called the Three Ecologies Process Seed Bank (named after the book by FÃ©lix Guattari; Guattari 2014). The off-line events will power an alter-university project called the Three Ecologies Institute. Like the SenseLab, the 3E Institute will operate at the intersection of art, philosophy, and activism. Its aim is to evolve collaborative techniques of relation for the collective valorization of forces of primary resistance. Its only product is the process of emergent collectivity. The ideas contained in this manifesto were developed through this project, in dialogue with a network of alter-economic thinkers in and around the Economic Space Agency. The orientation of the concepts, and in many cases their content, has been strongly in-formed by the collective making-thinking process of the SenseLab, and would not have been possible without it. This particular articulation is just one among many churning in the creative cauldron of the ongoing 3E project. It does not represent a consensus (just one proposed suite of attractors), and will undoubtedly change significantly through the evolution of the collective process. A follow-up essay will tell the tale of how it plays out.
