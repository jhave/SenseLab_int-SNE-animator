Purity, and the sense of personal moral superiority that goes along with it, would not be a factor. Since all of this would be happening in a pore of the dominant society, it would be necessary for the project to find ways of processually coupling with the existing economy in order to sustain itself. Even more importantly, it would couple with other alter-economy projects operating along different lines, as well as alternative political movements of all kinds, including the burgeoning activist peer-to-peer world (https://p2pfoundation.net). The project would be a collaborative partner in an ecology of powers. Its creative process engine would function as a driver of primary resistance disseminating tendentially postcapitalist process seeds into its surrounding fields, with which it strives to enter into mutually beneficial symbiosis, all the while feeding off the dominant capitalist economy where needed, rather feeding it.
