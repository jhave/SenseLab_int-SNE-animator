Scholium. The surplus-value generated by a second-order event-derivative is also of another order than that of surplus-value of life. The quantitative event-derivative effects a conversion from qualitative surplus-value of life to surplus-value of information. It is the anticipated ever-more of information that drives the production of knowledge. Surplus-value of information is the technical analogue of the surplus- value of life, which it parallels in another register, exploiting the same conditions of emergence. When the results of the quantification are reapplied in regulatory fashion to the field of emergence, an event transpires. The second-order derivative folds back onto the field of emergence to reprime it. This regenerates a primary event-derivative or surplus-value of life, and the cycle repeats. Since the application is generally reductive, and the channeling regulatory, the intensity of the reprimed surplus-value of life is lesser (it effectively envelops fewer contributory factors, straddles fewer differentials, covering less of a spread). The lesser intensity of the reduced surplus- values of life produced when second-order event-derivatives re-event themselves in the field from which they derived is what earns them the label of "degenerate." Peirce uses this word to denote a less intense mode of a category fundamental to process (for example, when a relation, or "thirdness," can be decomposed into a triangle of dual relations, or a "secondness" can be understood as a collection of individuals, these are degenerate forms of their respective categories in relation to a nondecomposable integral of three, or so close an embrace between two that they cannot be separated without their natures being destroyed).
