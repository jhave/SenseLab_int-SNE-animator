Scholium b. The concept of surplus-value of flow is an extrapolation from Marx's analysis of interest-bearing capital as money "already pregnant with surplus-value," such that the profit generated "is not the result of the act of purchase, the actual function that it performs here as money, but rather of the way in which this act is connected with the overall movement of capital" (Marx 1991, 463). This idea of the "pregnancy" of an act with surplus-value is generalized here to cover all movements plying the capitalist field, as they phase between the immanent outside of potential and take-up by apparatuses of capture. The pregnancy with surplus-value is pregnancy with potential, primed for relational emergence-effect production. Under neoliberalism, surplus-value of flow takes on an increasingly central role, as turnover accelerates and more and more sectors are catapulted into movement by globalization. This growing importance expresses itself in an obsession among investors for "liquidity." The generalized concept of surplus-value as pregnantly connected with the overall movement of process can be designated by the name machinic surplus-value (Deleuze/Guattari 1983, 232-235). Machinic surplus-value is a synonym for surplus-value of flow emphasizing its imbrication with computerization and automation.
