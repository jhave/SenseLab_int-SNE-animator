It would suffer from the entropy native to extensive, spatialized systems. There is a creative advance of process precisely because there is a countervailing tendency to entropy: a negentropy. This countervailing is the tendency of tendency to continuously "generate [intensive] magnitude through motion." Think again of the heightened relational sensitivity of the individual starlings' movements in the flock of ten thousand, and the way it packs potential into the flocking-event's global motion, intensely animating the number of starlings. Qualitative differential is the animating force; quantification piggybacks the entropic force.
