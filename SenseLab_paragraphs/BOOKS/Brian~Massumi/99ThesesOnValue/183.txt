Scholium b. Critique is important, but not as a policing of ideological or analytic correctness. In that role, it is a normative mechanism that goes against the grain of the creative advance of capitalism, but in exactly the wrong way: in a way that does not effectively connect to its processual nature. Because of this, it misses the boat. It is already outrun by capital before it even finishes touting its own correctness. Critique, practiced as if it were a primary resistance, is self-defeating. This does not mean that it has no role, just that its role is not the sovereign role it too often arrogates for itself. Its role is is the more modest one of assisting movements of escape by helping them scout out the terrain of the field of emergence, and to shield them by responding to arguments aimed at disarming them. Critique can provide backup for their primary task of self-affirming their qualitative difference, of carrying themselves to higher, tendentially postcapitalist, powers. It cannot, and should not, direct them.
