Scholium. In the aesthetics of value, beauty would be a pure-quality word for an actualized quantum of value. As value-word, it would displace the profit-word. It would be the abstract figure of surplus-value of life. Adventure is the way beauty outdoes itself, in self-driving processual turnover. Thought of in tandem with the dynamic of adventure, beauty does not privilege the steady-state notion of harmony. Based on a play of qualitative differentials –  irreducible contrasts whose tensions activate incommensurable tendencies – this kind of beauty would involve an unabstractable element of discord. Traces of zest, adventure, and wonder troubling its pure quality would keep beauty processually honest. In the processual vitality they make felt, discord would be palpable. Dissensus – the uneraseability of qualitative differentials and the incommensurability of co-motional tendencies – would be affirmed. A certain off-balancedness would accompany the process. It, also, would be affirmed. This would prevent a systemic self-satisfaction (reproduction) or structural entropy (stasis) from setting in. Politically, the trick would be to prevent this constitutive imbalance from running the process aground. The process would have to be so conditioned as to metabolize dissensus, fusing its co-motion of tendencies into an iterative rhythm of creative advance, integrally expressing itself, in drop after drop of surplus-valued experience. The trick would be to make incommensurables compossible. This is precisely what an ecology does.
