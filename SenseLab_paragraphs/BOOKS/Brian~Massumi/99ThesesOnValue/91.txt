Human capital was invented by neoliberal capitalism to replace the figure of the worker in an attempt to render obsolete the antagonism between worker and capitalist that structured the preceding industrial phase of capitalism. What better way than to make the capture by capital self-acting? To make the individual's becoming-itself a capital equation? The ongoing neoliberal project of disabling that antagonism flattens capitalist subjectivity into a single figure: the "entrepreneur of oneself" (Foucault 2008, 224-226). This project is successful to the degree to which complicity replaces antagonism (or in the more traditional Marxian vocabulary, contradiction) as the fundamental mode of existence of the life of the individual in the capitalist field, at every level of society.
