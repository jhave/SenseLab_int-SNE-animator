Scholium. Designed into the blockchain is a libertarian market fundamentalism (Golumbia 2016). Not only is the conventional three-fold definition of money uncritically assumed, underplaying the speculative side of cryptocurrencies (see T23), it is further assumed that economic activity comes in discrete units of action. Each such unit is a transaction between two individuals. The transaction is entered into according to each indivual's calculus of their own self-interest. The freeing of the market from the control of the banks and national governments is thus little more than a liberation of self-interest. The blockchain is a technical distillation of the ideology of individual self-interest that is one of the major tendencies in-forming capitalism. It takes capitalism's basic market ideology and tries to purify it, and objectify that purification in a technical system. It radically reinforces the concept of the market that is at the heart of capitalism, along with the transactional exchange model that is central to the concept of the market.
