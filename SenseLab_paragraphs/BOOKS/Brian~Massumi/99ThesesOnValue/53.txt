Scholium. The choice of "creativity" is made in full cognizance of the fact that neoliberal capitalism has appropriated the term. "Innovation" and "creative capital" are buzzwords signposting this appropriation. Surplus-value is the engine of creative advance of the capitalist system. But the quality of capital's creativity is best captured in a related phrase, which expresses the inherent violence of capitalism's economizaton of life's qualitatively in-the-making: "creative destruction." But what of life's in-the-making proper, considered as such, vitally instead of economically? What of the creative advance of life as it complexly plies its field of emergence, that immanent outside of the capitalist system whose qualitative differentials capitalism data-mines for conversion to its own ends? Vital process too is self-driving. It too self-iterates, turning over on itself across its punctual expressions to continue apace. It too runs on excess, serially fed-forward.
