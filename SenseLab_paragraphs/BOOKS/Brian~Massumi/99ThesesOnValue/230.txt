Scholium b. In any case, they have no choice in this matter. Complicity is an ontological condition under neoliberal capitalism. They cannot stake out a a position outside the capitalist field, because it only has an immanent outside. This in no way means that they will be "all in" it. There is no position of purity from which to oppose capitalism. But by the same token, there is no being all in it. There is power in the duplicitous positioning that is potentially creative. There is no reason in principle why creative duplicity cannot can immanently leverage postcapitalist difference.
