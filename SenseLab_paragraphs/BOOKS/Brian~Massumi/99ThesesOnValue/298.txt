— Speculative strategy b. Fun and games. The differential play of tendencies should be just that: play. Gaming models might enter into the larger field of play, especially if they privilege collective action rather than revolving around individual inputs. But they would not define the relational space overall. Play is a more encompassing concept than gaming. Play can take up into itself a heterogeneity of affective intensities. These are really produced through the artifice of "make-believe." However, they are produced in an arena where the normative contexts in which they are conventionally found are under suspension, so that the affective intensities are staged independently of their capture by function (playing pirates, for example, does not involve being at sea or making someone actually walk the gang-plank – but the players have to feel that this being done). This skirting around use-value allows the unfolding of the intensities to undergo emergent modulation. Play is an operative tendency connoting a processual openness. Events "play out" as their constitutive tendencies unfold. Systems have "play" as they test their limits. Techniques of play- relation are a serious domain for the exploration of alter-unfoldings. These may be staged in such as way as to carry an exemplary force for export to extra-play contexts, introducing a margin of play into them that allow them to test their tendential limits. Don't make political platforms. Make play political. Make play not programs.
