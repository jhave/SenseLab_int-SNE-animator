Lemma. This difference in mode of operation marks a difference between two orders, one directly qualitative, the other built upon quantification. Between the orders there is both separation and conjunction. Separation, because they are linked by a process of conversion. Conjunction, because one indexes the other. The two orders stand in disjunctive articulation with each other, neither identical nor opposite: different in nature, but processually linked. Both register, in their own ways. In addition, quantification registers the qualitative, but only in its own general way. (For more on the complexities of the relation between quantity and quality, see T79.)
