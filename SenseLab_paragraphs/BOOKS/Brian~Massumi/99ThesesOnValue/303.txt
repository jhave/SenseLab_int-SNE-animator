— Speculative strategy e. Individualism. Internal to the process, there would be no division in individual shares. This means that on the inside there would be no unitization of value, in terms of currency or other forms of tokens. This is done to safeguard improvisation, which is never a question of individual creativity. It is always a playing out of a differential field. The field includes suprapersonal factors – habitus, collective memory, cultural allusions, genres, genders, plus any number of nonhuman factors that prime the field and can serve as cues or contingent triggers – as well as infrapersonal factors. The latter pertain to the co-motion of bare-active tendencies vying to take hold of the body as a vehicle of their own expression, and to increase their power to self-perform by composing with other tendencies, differentially affecting more than one body in concert through an emergent collective attunement to the stirring tendential potential. Improvisation, looked at in this way, is a transindividual machinic subjectivity, or subjectivity-without-a-subject. It operates by synergy and the fusion of a multiplicity of moves into the continuity of a transition. It expresses itself in and as an emergent collectivity marshalling the power of a continuum whose fusional taking-form cannot be reduced to the sum of its participating individuals.
