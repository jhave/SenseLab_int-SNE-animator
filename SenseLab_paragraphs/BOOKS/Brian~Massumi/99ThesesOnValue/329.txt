Scholium a. Becoming-reactive is the epitome of ugliness â€“ and violence breeds reaction. Violence is dissensual in a curtailing and destructive way, rather than creatively and metabolically. Discord as a processual virtue associated with beauty is mutually intensifying, not eliminative or limitative. If violence is used, it must first be converted into an affirmative force (Deleuze 1983, 70). The only thing to be eliminated is the becoming-reactive of forces.
