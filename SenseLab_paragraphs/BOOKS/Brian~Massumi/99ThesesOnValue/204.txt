Scholium a. This capture is constitutive of the personal, as the proprietary dimension of the individual subject considered (and considering itself) as a discrete, separate entity. Personalization is synonym for the capture of affect for the constitution of the proprietary dimension of the subject. Personalization bears a privileged relation to economization. Arguably, it does not exist outside processes of economization. Certainly the subject as we know it (commonly referred to as the "bourgeois individual," mini-sovereign of its own private domain) is a creature of capitalist economization and does not exist outside of it. It is clear that the subject as separate, self-subsisent entity, rather than a self-avowedly integrally-relational being- becoming, does not exist in indigenous societies. Neither did it exist, for entirely different reasons (having to do with the ferocity of the integral subsumption of all movement under a regime attempting by any means necessary to peak-out in a maximally sovereign over-subject) in non-European despotisms or the monarchisms of Europe as tendentially driven by their processual ideal (attractor state) of the absolute monarchy (Dean and Massumi 1993). It will necessarily be the case that the personal, pseudo-sovereign subject will have to go extinct in the postcapitalist future, in favor of transsubjective movements of creative-relational self-decision, carried to their highest power. This is what Nietzsche meant when he spoke of the overcoming of the human by its own more-than human powers of becoming. It is also what Foucault referred to when he spoke of "Man" as "a face drawn in the sand at the edge of the sea" (Foucault 1994, 387). The "human" and "Man" are the collective categories under which the process of personalization has subsumed its would-be sovereign individuals.
