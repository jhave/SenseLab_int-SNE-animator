â€” Speculative strategy g. Accumulation. There would be no drive to accumulate anything other than techniques of relation and the archival elements fueling the anarchive. The digital platform involved would be open source, freely available for uptake and adaptation. The process seeds would not be proprietary. They would be meant to disseminate. This would make the project an open, dissipative system. Although it would tend toward its own continuance, it would not be afraid to die, either by its own potential-crunching volatility or by extreme success (exhausting the pool of potential it was effectively conditioned to mobilize). Even in death, it would live on in the process seeds it disseminated. Self-preservation would not be its aim. This willingness to risk itself would safeguard its quality of adventure, and prevent it from becoming an institution: an apparatus of capture driven by a will to sytematically reproduce itself, rather than processually spin off qualitatively different versionings of itself, free to go wild. It would dedicate itself to rewilding, not reproduction. This is an aspect of the process's anarchic disposition.
