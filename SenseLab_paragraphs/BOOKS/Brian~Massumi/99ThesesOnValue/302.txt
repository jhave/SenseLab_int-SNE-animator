to develop, between input of time and production of value. In the postcapitalist future, time is not money. It is life. The best way of warding away the time = money equation is to keep the sense of value focused on emergent effects that add up to more than the sum of their parts: that are valued, in the currency of direct experience, for their incommensurability with their causal input or conditioning factors. This leveraging of emergent effects is precisely what is meant by improvisation. Improvisation is another word for free action: life-activity unsubsumed by the use-value of existing systematic functionings and the work model that goes along with them. The techniques of relation fostering free action combine for a pragmatics of the useless. The useless is pragmatic in that it may prefigure the invention of new operations, from which new functions might emerge, that were unthinkable within the terms of existing systems.
