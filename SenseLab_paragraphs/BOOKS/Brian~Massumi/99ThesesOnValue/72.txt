Scholium. In leveraging, output does not observe a linear relation to input. Effect is incommensurate with cause. This can occur because the effect is emergent. It spins off from its conditions without being completely determined by them. A leverage effect embodies a more-than. Its occurrence cannot be explained by any particular underlying factor, because what it spins off from is the way in which multiple factors come together: it is an irreducibly relational effect that comes to more than the sum of its contributory parts.
