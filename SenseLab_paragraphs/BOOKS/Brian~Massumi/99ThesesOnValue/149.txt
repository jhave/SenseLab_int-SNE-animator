Scholium a. When the metrics associated with profit and capitalist surplus-value are reapplied to the field of life, the regulatory effect is the formating of life as "human capital," or the individual as entrepreneur of himself. Life activity is maximally channeled in keeping with demands of capitalism's self-driving. Life activity becomes maximally subsumed under the capitalist process. The reductive effect is to convert the individual into an embodied quantum of capital, living to appropriate its own punctual profits. To the economic data-point there now corresponds a quantum of human life. The individual generates private profit, as part of a conversion cycle between its activity in the field of life and the system-wide quantification process.
