Scholium b. Close attention must be paid to the systemic operations of capitalism in all of its arenas (consumer market, labor market, and investment and the financial markets).  However, systemic analysis is not enough. The analysis must extend to the expanded field of process. The word field is a handy way of holding onto the system/process distinction. "Capitalist field" can be used when the purview includes capitalism's immanent processual outside, with "system" reserved for the operations of the economy in the familiar restricted sense, as formalized by the traditional discipline of economics.
