Perhaps the Donald embodies a certain, hypercapitalist, overcoming of the person. He is certainly not an integrated one. Perhaps he embodies an immanent alter- personhood describing the limit of neoliberal capitalist subjectivity. If so, even though it takes the personal movement of the process of capitalism down an approach to the limit, it is unlikely to bring it to a tipping point. This is because the hypermasculinism of his persona (that may be the best word for it) gestures to generic figures of the masculine, as a condition of its hypering of them. This enables more everyday, less deregulated capitalist subjects to recognize themselves in him in spite of his excesses and in spite of their having no basis for an identification with him. By what criterion is there a sameness between a billionaire born into wealth and privilege and a middle American in the Rust Belt with the fear of God in them about falling into poverty (if they are not already in it)? Weirdly, Trumpians are recognizing their own difference in his distorted mirror. They are seeing what they experience as their own exceptionalism: what makes them special as Americans, vis-Ã -vis the hated un- American Americans. The list of these includes "liberal progressives" (who conspiratorally control the "mainstream media" and the "deep state" establishment), immigrant "job-stealers," and "entited" African-Americans. Traditional theories based on identification with a "charismatic leader" (bumbling, militantly ignorant, gaffe- happy Trump, charismatic?) cannot begin to account for his phenomenon.
