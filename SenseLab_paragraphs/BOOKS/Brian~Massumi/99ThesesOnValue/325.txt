Scholium. The derivative financial markets, which have taken over the pilot function of the capitalist economy, run more on affect than on underlying economic "fundamentals." In a sense, the alter-economic strategies advocated here are taking the most advanced sectors of the neoliberal capitalist economy, not at their word (which is ambiguated by lip-service to outmoded classical-liberal economic rhetoric), but at what they do: their own propaganda of the deed. If they can use affective intensities as the engine of their process, why couldn't another kind of economy? One that does not just run on affective intensities, but affirms them purely for the surplus- value of life they yield. One that refrains from brutally subsuming them under the profit-hungry quantification mechanisms driving capitalist accumulation. One that economizes alter-wise.
