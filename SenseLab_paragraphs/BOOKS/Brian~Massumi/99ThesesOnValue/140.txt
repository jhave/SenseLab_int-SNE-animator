Scholium. This is because capitalism itself is a mode of power. It is a worldwide apparatus of capture. Arguably, it is the only universal power formation (universal in the sense that it potentially extends to every geographical corner of the earth and into every cranny of life). As a power formation, capitalism bears an enormously complicated relationship to regulation and norms. Its status as a more-than-human driver of human becoming is in every respect bound up with the question of what evolving mode of power capital constitutes, and how it relates to other modes of power with which it shares the field of life, and ply the same field of immanence â€“ for there is only one. Capitalism increasingly integrates the power formations into its own operation, subsuming them but without erasing their difference in mode of operation (always leaving a qualitative remainder). Sorting these issues out involves paying special attention to the way in which capitalism captures, and in what way that involves and/or exceeds regulation and norms. Given its predominance in the neoliberal epoch of capitalism, the most suggestive entry point into this analysis is through the angle of financial capital. This means grappling with the complexity of derivatives, and pushing further the account of how quantity, intensity, and affect interrelate, the different ways in which qualitative differentials are integrated without erasing them, and what manner of surplus-value (self-driving emergence-effect) is produced through that supplementation.
