Scholium d. The individual human-capital subject is an integration of a differential array of sub-tendencies. At the same time, the multiplicity of human-capital subjects co-habiting the field of life are themselves sub-tendencies composing the higher-order integration of the capitalist system. The capitalist process moves through the levels. It is transsubjective and transindividual. If we restrict our attention to the self- consistency of the movements of becoming of a quantum of human capital (its phased self-driving, on its own level, as its own phenomenon), we are considering it as a subject. If we consider it from the point of view of the transsubjective movement of the capitalist process through it, we are seeing it as a fractal region of capitalism's subjectivity-without-a-subject. The expression of a subject's fractality can be muted on its own level, creating the effective fiction that it is a discrete, separate entity. The job of discipline and morality is to construct such effective fictions. They obscure the fact that, from the processual subjectivity-without-a-subject point of view, all subjects are transsubjective and transindividual. That is a necessary aspect of their composition, and a necessary dimension of their being in becoming.
