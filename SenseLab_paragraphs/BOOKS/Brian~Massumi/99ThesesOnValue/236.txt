Scholium b. Another example makes the processual imbrication of quality and quantity more intuitive. Take two flocks of starlings on two consecutive days. On the first day, there are ten. The second day, after a major migratory influx, there are ten thousand. Now imagine a startle that flushes the starlings into flight. Think of the quality of the movement in the each case. The ten thousand bank and turn, folding into and through each other with wonderous grace and beauty, thickening into swirling creases and thinning out into scatter zones, the swirling and the scattering themselves folding into and out of each other with awe-inspiring topological complexity. These starlings have zest. All of this is measurable. But it would be a defiance to even try to speak of the event without employing aesthetic terms. The measure of it would miss the eventness of the event: its singular quality that makes it stand out as an event, backgrounding for an instant everything else. The eventness of the event is a pure quality. Now think of the ten taking flight. This is still impressive, for a landlubber species such as ours. But it is impressive in a comparatively measly way. It is not awe-inspiring, and does not bring words like wondrous grace and beauty to the tips of our tongues. This congregation of birds has less zest. The movement is qualitatively different, carrying less topological potential owing to the smaller number of contributory starling factors. The movement has its own quality, just of lesser intensity. Both takings-flight involve a number of birds. The number of birds in each case corresponds to a greater or lesser occupation of sky space. But this extensive element does not come without being enveloped in a qualitative difference that insists on itself, in an irreducibly aesthetic manner. The quality of the events are conditioned by the quantities involved, without being reducible to them.
