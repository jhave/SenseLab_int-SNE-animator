Scholium a. Because capitalism is effectively universal (potentially in force everywhere), piggy-backing on every move affirming qualitative surplus-value of life in and for itself, there is the potential for a corresponding capture of capitalist surplus- value. This, however, does not mean that everything we do is "in" the capitalist system, in the sense of being completely determined by it. There is no "all in" the capitalist system, precisely because its process dips into an immanent outside in order to capture the potentials brewing there. Capitalism is aspirationally all-taking. But that does not mean that everything is completely given to it. The origination of potential belongs to its immanent outside. As an open system, it is to its outside that capitalism owes its own, derivative, creative powers. The mechanisms of capture of the capitalist process must reach into the immanent outside in order to extract a profit, and to generate a quantum of capitalist surplus-value to self-drive the system onward to an ever-next extraction. Once again, there is always a remainder of potential left over after this operation. The operation is a capture of autonomy. The neoliberal individual is a pivot point for both the generation of movements of escape, and for their capture. The individual under neoliberalism is complicit with capitalism by its very nature, and by the same token, it is in primary resistance to it, also by nature (by virtue of its transindividuality).
