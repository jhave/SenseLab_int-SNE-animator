Scholium f. The neoliberal subsumption of human life under capital that peaks on the trading floor, and is embodied more broadly in human capital, is the culmination of a process that has run through human history. It makes palpable something that retrospectively appears to have been the case all along: that humans are not the masters of the capitalist process. They are captives of it, down to their own self- fashioning. Humans do not run capitalism, capitalism runs through the human. They do not direct its development, its self-driving annexes their becoming. Human capital is the self-accomplishment of capitalism as a power formation.
