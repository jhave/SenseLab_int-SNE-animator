Scholium b. Capital comes in many forms. It is not confined to the financial markets. It comes in other forms than investment money and financial instruments. Labor, to the extent that it is used to leverage an excess-over, is a form of capital ("variable capital" in the Marxian vocabulary). Equipment used to gain a competitive edge is also capital ("fixed capital"). As is copyright-protected intellectual property used to unlevel the informational playing field. Prestige value, such as star status, is leveraged as a form of social capital. Reputation is another leverageable form of social capital, both in its traditional and emerging online forms. By neoliberal reckoning, an individual human being itself is a form of capital. The financial markets play the differentials between all of these forms of capital, and more.
