Scholium a. Something that has developed the systematic power to animate itself, that has a self-driving dynamism, that exhibits a vitality of becoming, qualifies as a subjectivity. A subjectivity is defined by its power to self-produce and vary. Subjectivities are always open systems. Their self-driving is self-relating: they phase through thresholds of transition across which they qualitatively vary. Each phase gathers up the last into its own ongoing, which is always already prefiguring, or "preaccelerating" the next (Manning 2009, 5-7, 13-29). The phases are in a relation of differential mutual inclusion in nonlinear time, constituting a distributed, fundamentally non-cognitive memory. The memory has two aspects: memory of the past (already realized potential stored in trace form) and memory of the future (the leftover of potential effectively fed forward for subsequent phases, preaccelerating them). The past memorial aspect is seen in the case of capitalism in its preservation of formations from the past. This is important for understanding the heterogeneity of the power formations composing its ecology of powers, in which past formations are retained as "archaisms with a contemporary function" (Deleuze/Guattari 1983, 240 251, 257-258).)
