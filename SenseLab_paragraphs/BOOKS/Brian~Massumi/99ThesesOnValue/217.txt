Scholium a. The deregulation tendency of neoliberal capitalism extends to the emotional composition of the person. Its subjects' self-fashionings have a tendency to run away with themselves, in spite of their generic narrative channeling. This actually occurs when the grand narrative of "individualism" that is so much a part of neoliberalism (even though its process is always taking away with its invisible subjectivity-without-a-subject hand what its system gives with its more perceptible individualizing handshake) is taken too much to heart. This can breed downright idiosyncrasies. Fortunately for capital, these can always be recaptured as niche markets. Their persons can also become human-capitalist entrepreneurs of themselves, capitalizing on their borderline abnormality, or cartoonish exaggerations of generic narrative norm, through Youtube channels harvesting internet surplus- value of flow. It also breeds monsters, for example when the individualism gets overly "rugged." Donald J. Trump's overbearing glee in his breaking of the norms of good conduct, and neoliberal embrace of corruption, exemplifies this. The idea of the "good citizen" doesn't even ring a bell for this hypercapitalist. Neither does narrative coherence. If narrative self-actualization is the regime of truth of the more normative neoliberal subject, here we are definitively in the "post-truth" regime. Shards of narrative are produced in profusion. But they are always refracted through the distorting prism of a hypermasculinity exaggerating its generic template to absurd dimensions. The absurdity is such that it is hard to take Trump seriously as a person. This is reflected in the colloquial use of his name as a common noun: the Donald.
