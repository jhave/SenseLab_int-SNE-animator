The human is expelled from the apparatus only to be incorporated all the more fully into it, as a relay point in increasingly integrated autonomic systems. Expelled as commander to be integrated as connector, the human is transformed by its own works from a brain legislating life to a ligament bindng machine cycles. Human rule ceases to be the measure of the universe as the human is adjoined to machinic processes capable of operating on scales infinitely smaller or larger than any single human being can comprehend or control: from despotic overcoding to cosmic adjunction. The human organism has been most successfully subsumed not in the overarching name of global unification, but by forms of inorganic life that can tap into cosmic energies, and limit human participation to local adjacency to them.5 Fittingly, the most advanced and publically appreciated apparatus of this kind is aimed at obliterating the human being it "services": the smart missile. Its nuclear kin marked the first recognized irruption in history of the exhuman apparatus. Nuclear weapons systems are a command-function materialization that descends into the infinitely small in order to release the infinitely large, in fatal form. The microchip is the "productive," or seductive-inductive, version of the same movement. As it continues its passage to infinity on the side of the small, it is inventing perception- and judgment-functions that may be released into the autonomic environment to be incorporated into infinitely expandable, but in principle sustainable, large-scale exhuman apparatuses (fuzzy logic, silicon neurons, virtual reality).6 Although the late capitalist State multiplies and intensifies army and spy machines, its trademark apparatuses are those specializing in perception- and judgment-functions applicable to civilian use as well: from the mass media to interactive media and associated technologies. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the State's multiplication and intensification of these machines may augur its own demise.
