From blinding light 
to disappearance
from the irruption of the State 
to the effacement of its subject. 
We return to late-capitalist America 
by way of ancient China
following the self-dispersing body of the Despot. 
Our face
which we cannot countenance
is his. 
After all.
Leave it to the bureaucrats. 
A history of the present 
for a leaderless future 
these eyes will never see. 
Do not ask us to remain the same.
