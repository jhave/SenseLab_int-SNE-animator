Triple plus. Reagan's own body functioned as a substance of unity. He was not content to take his place as one in the multiplying series. He would be the preeminent term. Simply by virtue of his greater mobility. A man can stand on a statue's pedestal, but a statue can never fill a man's shoes. If Reagan stood on every pedestal presented, and draped himself in every flag in sight, the entire series of national icons would converge toward him. He would be catapulted out of their already elevated plane to an even higher one: he would be the substance of the substance of unity, the essence of the essence of subjectivity. He would be what made mother's milk wet. All he had to do was remain in perpetual motion, circulating from one hallowed site to another, not just arrogating to himself their life-giving powers but raising them to a higher power. Now it is no longer one substance of unity being added to another; they begin to multiply exponentially.
