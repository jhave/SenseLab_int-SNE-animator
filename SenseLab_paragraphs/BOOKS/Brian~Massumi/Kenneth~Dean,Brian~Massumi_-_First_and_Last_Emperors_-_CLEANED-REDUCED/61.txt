The old Bush spent the better part of the Gulf War quietly vacating. Employing a technological body double had allowed him to melt along with "America" into the military apparatus, while simultaneously putting his genteel way across the green. The President reappeared after his early troubles with Bushspeak and the wimp factor transformed. He had split. Time magazine dubbed him "Men of the Year," dividing its cover between two half-images of his face. "A Tale of Two Bushes," went the title. "One finds a vision on the global stage; the other still displays none at home" [7 January 1991]. It has been revealed that his boyhood nickname was "Have Half" ["Trumpeting Victory in Retreat," Time Australia, 2 December 1991, p. 63].
