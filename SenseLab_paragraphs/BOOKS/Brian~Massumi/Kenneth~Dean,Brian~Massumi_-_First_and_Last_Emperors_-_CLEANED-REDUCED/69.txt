Although glory did burst forth in Bush's general vicinity, it did not adhere to his disappearing person, and was of an explosive kind that leaves little trace. Bush's Gulf-War glory was as self-expiring as the blast and accompanying clapping of hands. It did not last him even to the beginning of the reelection campaign. Bush is incapable of accumulating prestige in the way Reagan did. General Schwarzkopf was the Reaganoid glory hog at this trough. It was his body which gave a visual image to military prowess, his voice which expressed the appropriate bluster and sentiment. Bush, for his part, continued to putt. He let Schwarzkopf stand in for him on the stage of glory. The General retired soon after to hefty speaking fees and speculation about political ambitions. It didn't seem to matter to Bush. Schwarzkopf was merely his human proxy. One of many. Time magazine's reelection campaign coverage referred to Bush's propensity for body-doubling in an inadvertantly oxymoronic headline: "Bush Makes it Personal: The President Counters a Rightist Challenge with a Stream of Surrogates" [6 January 1992, p. 48]. It was his inhuman surrogate, the high-tech hardware of war, that summed him up most singularly.
