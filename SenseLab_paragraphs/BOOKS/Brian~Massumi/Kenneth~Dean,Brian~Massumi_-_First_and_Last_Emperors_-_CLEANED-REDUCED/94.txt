Body, family, country share a common substance that unites them but at the same time seems to exist on a higher plane than they. The substance that unifies paradoxically inhabits a world apart. One, two, three, plus unity makes four: body, family, country, flag. Multiplicity is a stubborn thing. No problem. Four, and many more, will be as one, in a second kind of unifying substance. "I have heard," Reagan's autobiography continues, "more than one psychiatrist say that we imbibe our ideals from our mother's milk. Then, I must say, my breast feeding was the home of the brave baby and the free bosom." The motherland. Now body/family/country not only have a common substance, but a shared energetic principle or generative fluid: mother's milk (five). The flag brings forth and replenishes because mother's milk soaks its fabric like blood flowing in the veins of the new-born baby. The nation's procreative fluid is not seminal. It is maternal, and the maternal is presented as sexless. Nations reproduce by non-sexual means.
