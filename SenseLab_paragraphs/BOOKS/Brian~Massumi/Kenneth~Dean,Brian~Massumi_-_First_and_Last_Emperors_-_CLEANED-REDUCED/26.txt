The concept of subversion so central to Reagan's thinking acts as a kind of somatic threat converter. Through subversion, the rival body that attacks from without becomes a disease that saps from within. Perhaps it's not Nancy on the other side of the door. Maybe it's a communist, or an illegal immigrant who got in through the 'back yard.' Reagan droned an unending litany of modern-day lice. Communists, illegal immigrants, drug users, gays, feminists, '60s die-hards, computer hackers, and welfare cheats. Reagan lice came in an astounding variety of forms. But their dominant mode was less parasitic than viral. It was the age of AIDS.
