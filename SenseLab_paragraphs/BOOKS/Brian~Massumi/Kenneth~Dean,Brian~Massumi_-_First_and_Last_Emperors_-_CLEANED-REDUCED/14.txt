The foundation provided by embodiment of the national spirit is in continual slippage. It begins to recede from the three material terms it purports to ground into loftier and loftier dimensions. The substance of unity becomes a substance of the substance of unity, in a potentially infinite regress that can be controlled only by transforming the process of exponential multiplication back into one of simple addition: in other words by finding a way of managing the ever-excessive virtue of the American spirit by continuing to move laterally between terms on the same level instead of moving up into ever higher powers or dimensions. Above Reagan, the only personifiable unifying substance left to appeal to is God, and He rarely gives photo opportunities. Once Reagan's body had circulated long enough for the magic of all earthly national icons to rub off on him one after the other, after he had become their subjective sum, he had only two choices: ascend to the heavens, or begin circulating among himself. The asexual reproduction of the country culminates in the mechanical reproduction of the image of its leader.
