Reagan had became immanent to the social field in spite of himself, as a side-effect of an impossible quest for transcendence that left his audio-visual image proliferating endlessly across the country he had tried to elevate to his lofty plane. After leaving office, Reagan made millions of dollars providing photo opportunities for the Japanese imperial family and high-ranking functionaries. Bush rolled at their feet. He just didn't have the right stuff. He had no choice but to dispense with transcendence, to sink into his own self-effacing immanence. Image faint. Getting fainter by the course. Doctors say it had the flu. "I was only trying to get some attention" [ABC evening news, 8 January 1992]. Fade to black.
