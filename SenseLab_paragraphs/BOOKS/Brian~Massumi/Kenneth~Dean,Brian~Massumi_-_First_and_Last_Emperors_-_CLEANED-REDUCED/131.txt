First, his gestures. On a good day, Reagan was a master of the smooth move. Like the circle he drew in the air to illustrate the Great Wall, his movements drew pleasing figures in space. It was as if his entire body were a cartographer's pen drawing an invisible map of some atmospheric utopian realm. He surveyed an invisible space of well-being that was attached not to its body, but its movement, its transitoriness, its fluidity. The body would some day rot, perhaps was rotting already, but 'Camelot' would remain in the traces of his passing. Wholeness and wellness was not on his body; it was not in his body. It was around it, in his wake. It was like a negative trace of his body: his body grasped not as an object or an image of an object but as a set of ordered motions between unlocalizable points suspended in the air. "Wholeness" and happiness could be had by inhabiting the 'same' virtual space as Reagan. We could make our personal space coincide with his by going through the 'same' motions. Of course, any repetition of the 'same' passages between points that are by nature unlocalizable will be different, a translation, an im-personation (a personification of the unpersonifiable subsumed by the Reagan name). Repeating "Reagan's" gestures with a difference, we actualize a quadrant of his virtual geography in our personal neighborhood, overlaying his super-abstract kinetic map on our terrain, like an invisible image of all we could be (were we as inhuman as he).
