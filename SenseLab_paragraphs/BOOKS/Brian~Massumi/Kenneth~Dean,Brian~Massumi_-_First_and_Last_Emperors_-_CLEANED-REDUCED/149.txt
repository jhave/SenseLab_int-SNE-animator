Then again, all that may never happen. In fact the opposite could well be the case: the new mania of State formation convulsing the world could be the State's last desperate gasp, or yet another rebirth. It would seem that the United States faces several choices: follow the Bush-thing as it jogs farther and farther into the proliferating-differentiating apparatus and away from the State as we have known it; or rehumanize. Rehumanization would consist in forcing the population, the territory, and the executive apparatus back into a content-laden homology with the body of the leader, resubsuming the "spirit" of the nation under the proud name of organic unity. This way leads back to the liberal "representative" democracy of the 1960s and 1970s, on to a "Reagan" third term, or toward the invention of an all-American fascism (with the likes of Jesse Helms and David Duke in the vanguard), depending on how vigorously the homology is forced. Unsavory options all. Where the option of following the apparatus may lead is a complete unknown.
