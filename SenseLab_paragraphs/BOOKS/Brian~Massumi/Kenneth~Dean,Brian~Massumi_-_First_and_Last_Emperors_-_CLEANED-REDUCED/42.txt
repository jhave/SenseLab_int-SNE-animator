But if, as was asserted earlier, a unity always exists in addition to and alongside the multiplicity it unifies, then it stands to reason that there is something more inclusive than unity, and more abstract than the simply topological: an interconnecting mechanism that defines the relation between the unifying substance and what it unifies. Subtending and surrounding the body and body image of the national unifier and the bodies and images they bring together, there is another kind of body that has no image--that can never have one because it is only ever in-between. There is a body without an image that inhabits the gaps. It occupies the spaces under, above, and between bodies and images, residing in the interrelation of all that is. It does not extract (dismember) or abstract (unify). It is effectively all-inclusive. The interactive medium: the 'body politic' in its fullest extension, at once infra-concrete and super-abstract. A void where no anus can go. But where the proper name "Reagan" can, and does.
