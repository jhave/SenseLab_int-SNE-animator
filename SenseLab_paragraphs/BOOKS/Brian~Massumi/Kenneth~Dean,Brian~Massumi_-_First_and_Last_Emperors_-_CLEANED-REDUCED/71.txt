Bush did in fact have a major public relations success of his own before the war broke out. Actually, it wasn't exactly his. It was Barbara who pulled it off, with a little help from her dog. Millie could never be mistaken for Lassie. The best-selling book she "dictated" to the First Lady tells in glossy pictures and bland words of the unremarkable day-to-day goings on on the White House lawn. The narration chronicles "with characteristic modesty" (jacket) the circuitous path that brought the First Dog to the White House, against all odds. "Ms. Millie," you see, is a down-home pup who, like the man she shadows through a "typical day," "shuns hounding media attention." "One dog's life as Presidential best friend": or as Presidential proxy? Yet another? Millie's Book [1990] outsold Reagan's second autobiography (which would seem to prefigure an impending second death) by many tens of thousands of copies, confirming that Bush immanence had in fact superseded Reagan transcendence as the dominant political dynamic, Stormin' Norman and his travelling war show aside ["Bush's Dog Outselling Reagan," Montr√©al Gazette, 28 November 1990]. Schwarzkopf is a reminder that "Reagan" is very much alive, again and as always, but the balance of quasi-corporeal power has at least temporarily shifted Bushward.
