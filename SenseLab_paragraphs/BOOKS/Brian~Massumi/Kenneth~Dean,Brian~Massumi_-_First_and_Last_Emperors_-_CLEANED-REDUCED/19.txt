Reagan's body was lacking in a big way. Reagan was a walking amputation. A preamputation. He was always already lame. It is interesting, and more than a bit worrying, to find that the First Emperor's preoccupation with feet recurs in Reagan's first autobiography. The title was taken from the movie King's Row. In Reagan's words, he played the part of a "gay blade" named Drake "who cut a swathe among the ladies." Drake, it seems, took to dating the daughter of a prominent doctor, who was not at all pleased with the arrangement. One day Drake was injured in a railroad accident. When he regained consciousness his legs were gone. The father of the woman he was dating had been the doctor assigned to treat him. "Where's the rest of me?" Drake cries.
