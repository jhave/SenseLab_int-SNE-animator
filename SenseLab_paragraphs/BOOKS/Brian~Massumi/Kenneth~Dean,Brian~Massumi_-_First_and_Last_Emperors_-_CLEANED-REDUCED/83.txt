In its "A Tale of Bushes" issue, Time magazine noted Bush's repeated attempts to exit the stage of speech by immersing himself in a physical activity that seems to embody mental control: "When faced with a complicated problem he often plunges headlong into physical activity--gunning his speedboat, pitching horseshoes, flailing away on the golf course. It is Bush's way, says an aide, to 'drive those demons of indecision out of his mind.'" [7 January 1991, p. 28]. Speaking manifests his indecision, his split condition, the fact that he is by nature divided against himself, his body possessed by "demons." It is only in short bursts of mute projectile motion that he appears at one with himself. Off and away: "Read my disappearing hips."
