We have argued against privileging phallic interpretations of every cut, split, and fracture. That is because excess, remainder, and contradiction can be and are imaged in many other ways than by gender. Every level in the State system of homologies has its own way of imaging the immanence-transcendence dialectic. Insisting on reducing them to the phallus robs them of their specificity. The disappearing Emperor is a phallus, but he is also an emperor. The decapitated head is a phallus, but one that formerly wore a hat. Once again, it is less a question of is than of composition, of how a multiplicity of components hold together while retaining their singularity and separate histories.
