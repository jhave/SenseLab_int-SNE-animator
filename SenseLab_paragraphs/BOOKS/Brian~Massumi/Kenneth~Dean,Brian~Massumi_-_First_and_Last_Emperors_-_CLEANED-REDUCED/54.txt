The hero of democracy (in this case Vaclav Havel, first post-Communist president of Czechoslovakia) is alive and dead, at liberty in jail, standing on his face for freedom--all in a single sentence, of sorts. A residual homology between country and body is detectable in the face that begins to reflect the soul of the people, before suddenly metamorphosing into a foot. And how will the "education president" improve education, a high school student innocently asks? "Well, I'm going to kick that one right into the end zone of the secretary of education" [ibid.]. When the well-being of the body/well-being of the nation equation is successfully made, it is not only with the wrong body but with the wrong end of it, as the President nonchalantly takes his leadership and kicks it up an educated ass.15
