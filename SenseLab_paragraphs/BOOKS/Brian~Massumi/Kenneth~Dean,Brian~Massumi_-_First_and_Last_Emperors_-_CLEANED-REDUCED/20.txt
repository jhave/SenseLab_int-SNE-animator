Reagan presents this scene as his most challenging role and the acme of his acting career. "A whole actor would find such a scene difficult; giving it the necessary dramatic impact as half an actor was murderous. I felt I had neither the experience nor the talent to fake it. I simply had to find out how it really felt, short of actual amputation." So he consulted physicians and commiserated with cripples. But, he says, "I was stumped." In the end, he manages. "I had put myself, as best I could, in the body of another fellow;" in becoming a good actor "I had become a semi-automaton." He is now a real-life amputee. And at that point he realizes that half of him has always been missing, he was always just limping along through life repeating his lines. He finds the rest of him in the mother's milk of patriotism and conservative ideals. What he does not say is that for the analogy to be complete this second, real-life healing would logically take the same form as the first: he would become whole by taking over "the body of another fellow." Now the other body a president would have take over to make himself whole is--every body. The body politic. Reagan verges on saying outright that the political magic he would work is akin to national possession: countless bodies unified by the same American spirit, one glorious body politic repeating in unison an old actor's favorite lines. Instead, he reminisces about his father, a shoe salesman who "spent hours analyzing the bones of the foot." It comes as little surprise later on when we learn that after being delivered with divorce papers by his first wife, Reagan went out and promptly broke a leg. And that what attracted him to his second wife, Nancy, was hearing that her father was a prominent surgeon. Years later, the most positive thing biographer Kitty Kelly would find to say about Nancy was that she had the "ability to embrace physical deformity."
