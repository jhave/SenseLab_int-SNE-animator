Reagan's brain, body, and body-image were supplemented and subtended by abstract figures: gestures and trajectories; and rhythms. These were without content, nonvisual, and suprapersonal. The word "figure" is therefore misleading. Call them processual lines. "Reagan"s political effectiveness was to be found on that pre-symbolic, pre-logical, quasi-corporeal level, in his ability to construct a body without an image: to "meld image and body in a space where they cannot be separated." [Agamben 1990:54-55]
