The plasticity and manifestness of Reagan's body unbalances not only a traditional Freudian approach, but more recent paradigms as well. It is difficult to see him, following the suggestion of a Baudrillardian critic, as a hyperreal male who "could always satisfy our iconic interests." He can only be perceived as a "satisfying" simulation of masculinity (a "hologram" of the American male) if vast stretches of his image production are ignored.11 A Lacanian analysis might find him the embodiment of the phallus, constituting subjectivities by distributing plenitude and lack, all the while remaining tragically absent to itself. This interpretation would privilege his amputational aptitudes, placing them under the sign of castration. But the cut of the scalpel can as easily be seen a positive power of plasticity as the playing out of a primordial lack. Given Reagan's organs' ability to regenerate and mutate, amputation could actually be considered an enablement: a precondition for migration and reconnection on a surface of variation.
