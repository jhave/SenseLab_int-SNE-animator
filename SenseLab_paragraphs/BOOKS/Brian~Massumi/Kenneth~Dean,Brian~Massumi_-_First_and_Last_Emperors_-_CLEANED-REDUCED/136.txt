1. Singular and Multiple. The State-form is not a form at all. It is an abstract process: a drive to "unity." To the extent that empirical States concretize that drive, they are one and the same. Every State is the State. The State does not evolve, nor even have an origin. It arrives, like fate, in a single stroke and fully formed, from a place that cannot be located. Over and over again. For "unity" is by nature unactualizable. The Emperor's conundrum: if the Great Unifier unifies the empire, is he a part of his own whole? If he is, then the empire is not unified: it is divisible into a subject and an object of unification. If he isn't, then the unity is not an empire: it is sovereignless. Any drive to unity is necessarily a drive to dominion, and necessarily fails. There is always a remainder and an excess of power: an object of regimentation that escapes, a subject of regimentation that recedes. If the State-form cannot be whole, it cannot be. It does not abide, it only arrives. Again: when it arrives, it is not the same, as always. It is multiple by nature. To the extent that actual states succeed in concretizing the drive to unity, they differ from themselves and from each other. The invariant lack of self-sameness inherent in the State-form is often expressed as a split body (dismemberment: in particular, amputation and decapitation) and as a split between body and mind (disappearance: the invisibility of the soul; lack of will). Collective attempts to overcome this continual self-differing focus on the body of the ruler as exemplary site for the incarnation of the State Idea.
