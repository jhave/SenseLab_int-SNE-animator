If the lips betray you, there are always the hips. If the hips say that you are not really jogging but swimming in nonwords, try missiles. The missile is an anti-raft, a kind of flesh-empty presidential de-flotation device that lifts what's left of the chief executive out of the feckless sea of mind/body disarticulation into the air again, the calm desert air before the rains. The mind/body split is overcome for a soaring instant in a bee-line flight to obliteration--the willed blankness of that which has no image, not because it has been divested of it but by its very nature.
