Sometimes Reagan seemed to beg for psychoanalysis. "I was the hungriest person in the house," he writes in Where Is the Rest of Me?, "but I only got chubby when I exercised in the crib; any time I wasn't gnawing on the bars, I was worrying my thumb in my mouth--habits which have symbolically persisted throughout my life." Identify with that, and you get a nation of thumb-suckers. Hardly a worthy adversary for the "Evil Empire."
