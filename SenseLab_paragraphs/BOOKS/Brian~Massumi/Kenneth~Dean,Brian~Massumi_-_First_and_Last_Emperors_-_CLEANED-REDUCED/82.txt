The Bush-thing's relation to the body without an image differs from "Reagan's" in important ways, in spite of the many continuities. In a way, it is Bush's that is the most radical of the two. In becoming-imperceptible, it divested leadership of its image (vocal and visual residue) as much as it was possible to do at its historical juncture. The Bush-thing returned the body without an image to its inhuman, unliving ground, or at least a late-capitalist translation of it. The quintessential capitalist space where body and image meld and become inseparable is technology, computerized military hardware at impact being the exemplary case. Where else do matter and intention so effectively combine than in a "smart" missile "servicing" its target?
