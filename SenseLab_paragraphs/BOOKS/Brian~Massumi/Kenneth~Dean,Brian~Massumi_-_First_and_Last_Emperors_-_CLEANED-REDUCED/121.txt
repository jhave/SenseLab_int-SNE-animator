Reagan could be the virile father of the nation, as when he bombed Libya; but he could just as easily be its favorite daughter (despite having killed Khadafy's). His political effectiveness did not depend on sustaining any particular symbolic configuration. Any one would do--as long as attention remained focused on his body. That was the bottom line. It didn't matter what symbolic connections were made to his body--only that some connection to it be made. CBS News correspondent Lesley Stahl recalled receiving a phone call from the White House press secretary thanking her for doing a highly negative story about Reagan. It didn't matter what the content was, he said; broadcasting images of Reagan, any images, could only help him.10 The White House press corps itself seems to argue against any theory of Reagan's political success being based on citizen identification with positive qualities associated with his visual image.
