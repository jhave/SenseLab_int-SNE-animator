Is this the final solution that Bush and his command-function double could deliver were they to turn their attention inward to domestic problems such as the "war" on drugs and alcohol? A taste of that was on TV, too: in the wake of the Gulf War, the Rodney King video showed how the untied hands of experts like the LA chief of police deal with "substance abusers" who also happen to be Black. There was a reaction to that. It was clear where the real abuse was. The country was not ready for the other face of the Bush-thing. After the riots, it was. Bush's deployment of the U.S. army to Los Angeles, "in what some aides now call a domestic Persian Gulf crisis" ["Bush Moves to Respond to Strong Test from Riots," New York Times, 4 May 1992, A11], recast him in the role of commander-in-chief. The police were declared innocent, as if in principle, irrespective of the evidence. Attracted by this premium of a priori innocence, commander-in-chief segued into chief of police. The command function had come home, with impunity. What this implies for the future, with the likes of soldier-worshipper Ross Perot, Klansman David Duke, and crypto-fascist Patrick Buchanan vying to be post-Bush Republican Party standard-bearer, can only be left to the imagination.
