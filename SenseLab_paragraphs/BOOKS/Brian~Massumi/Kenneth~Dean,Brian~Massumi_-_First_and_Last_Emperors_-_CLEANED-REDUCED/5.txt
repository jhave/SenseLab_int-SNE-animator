In a 1984 foreign policy media blitz across China, the 'Great Communicator' evidenced an affinity for the 'Great Unifier,' Qin Shi Huangdi, the brutal First Emperor of the unified Chinese state. Ronald Reagan found the Great Wall built by the Qin Emperor "awe-inspiring." "Imagine carrying boulders up here," he said wistfully. Would he like to have a Great Wall of his own? "Around the White House," he joked, drawing circles in the air. He would later pose among the ranks of the terra cotta soldiers protecting the Emperor's tomb, playfully substituting his own head for that of a decapitated imperial guard. Reagan was never more serious than when he was joking.1
