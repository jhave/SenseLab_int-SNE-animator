Bush gave it up. He borrowed another tactic from Reagan: he got scripted. When his aids began to pre-plan the questions and responses at as many of his press sessions and meetings with the public as possible, Bush's grammar improved markedly. But that left nothing to identify him by. Renouncing Bushspeak meant losing his only media-worthy characteristic: his spectacular lack of personality, popularly referred to as the "wimp factor." Bushspeak is a form of agrammatical self-effacement. According to a New York Times analysis ["Not Pretty. Seems to Work, Though," 9 March 1990], it is marked by an almost complete avoidance of the first person pronoun "I" and a tendency to drop active verbs. Non-Bushspeak Bush speak is a grammatical version of the same disappearing act. The stated policy of his press officials is that less is better, in stark contrast to the Reagan team's "any image, even a bad image, is good by definition." A successful Bush press meeting consists in issuing "nonwords," phrases that will  be carried on TV or in the print media but will be so slight in meaning and lackluster in character as to escape notice ["From Bush, a Few Choice Nonwords," International Herald Tribune, 31 August-1 September 1991].
