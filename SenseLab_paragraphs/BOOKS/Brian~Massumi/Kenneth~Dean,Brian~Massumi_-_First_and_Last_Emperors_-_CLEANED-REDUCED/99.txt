The most striking instance of this process was Reagan's legendary acceptance of the presidential nomination at the 1984 Republican Convention. His image was piped in larger-than-life on a huge video screen suspended above the podium. The imposing screen presence created a feeling of imperial aloofness that only highlighted Reagan's bodily absence. A heroic Nancy tried to compensate by hailing his talking head as if he could see her--as if they occupied they same space and level of reality. The image on the screen was repeated countless times around the red-white-and-blue bedecked convention hall in portraits held aloft by the adoring crowd. The giant screen, Nancy, and the proliferating close-up of the leader were united on the surface of the home viewer's TV screen. So there is a unifying substance higher than Reagan but not quite God: TV. But the TV promised land is nowhere. It is everywhere. The screen unifies incommensurable dimensions--portraits, Nancys and delegates, other screens with giant talking heads, political discourse, advertising. But it does it by the millions. In his moment of triumph, at the height of his unifying powers, Reagan is diffused to infinity. He disappears into an infinitely fragmenting video relay.
