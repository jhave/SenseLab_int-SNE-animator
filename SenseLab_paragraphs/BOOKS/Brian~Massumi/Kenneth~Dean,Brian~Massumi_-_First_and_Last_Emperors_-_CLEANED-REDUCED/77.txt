The impersonality of the command function animating the Gulf War was underlined by the macabre lack of affect palpable throughout. The cheer-full explosions of the missiles reaching their anonymous targets were durationless outbursts punctuating excruciatingly boring hours of anticipation. The Gulf War was a waiting war. News was slow, and when it did come, it was disappointingly incomplete. People were glued to their screens, waiting for something to happen. Would a chemical Scud hit Israel and widen the conflict? Would the ground war begin? If it did, would the US be mired in Iraq for months? Was the Iraqi front ringed by oil-filled moats? Did they have crude nuclear capability? When something did happen, it never measured up to all the things the untied tongues of the TV experts had already established could have happened. It almost went too smoothly for the American hardware. The hours of blurry-eyed waiting and endless repetitions of the few images and tidbits of intelligence available made every military event an anti-climax back home before it even had a chance to transpire on the battlefield. Just one thing stood out: zoom in and explosion. Blankness. Those amazing American missiles. When the war was over and the yellow-ribbon celebrations wound down, it started to become apparent just how little had happened in geopolitical terms. Kuwait was still ruled by a greedy royal family whose idea of democracy was easy access to domestic help. Saudi Arabia was if anything less democratic than before. And Saddam Hussein was still in possession of his moustache, doing the things he does so well, such as butchering his own people. It was as if the event of the war had "expired within the interstices of our television schedules, forever lost" in the video relay linking home-viewing screen to army computer.
