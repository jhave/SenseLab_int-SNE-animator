It would be a mistake to take this "schizophrenia" too seriously as a diagnosis, as if it corresponded to a pathological condition suffered by Bush "the man" or even collectively by his constituency. Bush's condition was every bit as slippery (multi-functional) as Reagan's. One article diagnoses Bush as a hysteric, a masochist, a transvestite, and an overcompensating macho male, all in the space of three pages, without noticing any contradiction. [Rubenstein 1990:256-58] Which makes perfect sense. As with Reagan, the question of contradiction simply does not arise, at least not on the level of being or meaning. The Presidential question is not "What ails him (us)?"--the obvious answer being "everything you like"--but rather "What does he do by acting that way? Where does it get him (us)?"
