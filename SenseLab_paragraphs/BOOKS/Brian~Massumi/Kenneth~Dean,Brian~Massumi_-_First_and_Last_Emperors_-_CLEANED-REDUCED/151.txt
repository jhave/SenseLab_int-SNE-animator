Or does it? How can we ignore the phallic resonance of the "short bursts of mute projectile motion" that make the Bush-thing most at one with himself? We can't. No matter how materialized, how inorganic, how neuter the Bush-thing is, it is still at least residually masculine, if only on one side of the split, on another screen belonging to a different apparatus than the missile (the mass media). And in the missile itself, it could be argued that masculinity is much more than residual. The command-function materialized so expertly in the missile is a splitting image of the idea of unity--and it is precisely the drive to unity that holds men and despotism together. The dynamic of unity is the playing out of their belonging together, it is their symbiosis, their interrelatedness, their combined force. The Bush-thing can be seen as masculinity's latest ruse: shed the despotic body as a strategy for preserving its driving Idea. Inorganic masculinity: the despot's last laugh.
