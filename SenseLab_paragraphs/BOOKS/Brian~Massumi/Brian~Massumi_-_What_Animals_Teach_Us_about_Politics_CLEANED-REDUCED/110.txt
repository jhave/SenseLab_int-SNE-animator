The singular is in opposition to the particular as much as to the general (theyâ€™re a package deal). Everything in a situation is potentially swept up in the movement of enaction, with an open-endedness as to the final form that will come to be determined, in a singular becoming catalyzed by the performative gestures taking place. This singularization even potentially affects the codes in place, which are susceptible to their own becoming, across supernormal suspensions of their already given form. Situations are not about conformation (conformity-producing application of a rule).
