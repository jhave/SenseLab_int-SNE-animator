The “as yet unknowable” part of the formulation concerns the “extension,” which is precisely into and through the event. Transported into the heart of the event, we are already moved by what will ensue. What is to come is already welling. But what is welling is present as yet only in the first stirrings of potential. Potential is being actively expressed, but as a movement of the as-yet inexpressible, because still-to-come. Instinct, as lived intuition, is the gestured expression of the as-yet inexpressible. It involves a living thinking-doing of the open-ended movement of expression, anchored in the situation, right down to its core, but leading tendentially beyond what is presently given in it.
