It is precisely because pure animality is experienced as inorganic, or supraorganic, that it can combine so well with abstraction, and even combine the slowness or heaviness of a matter with the extreme speed of a line that has become entirely spiritual. The slowness belongs to the same world as the extreme speed. (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 499)
This “line” is “a vital force specific to Abstraction” (499). Its “extreme speed” is one with intuition (498), which is one with life. “If everything is alive, it is not because everything is organic or organized but, on the contrary, because the organism is a diversion of life” (499). In intuition “everything passes between organisms” (499).
