Animal play creates the conditions for language. Its metacommunicative action builds the evolutionary foundation for the metalinguistic functions that will be the hallmark of human language, and which distinguish it from a simple code. The prehuman, preverbal embodied logic of animal play is already essentially language-like. It is effectively, enactively linguistic avant la lettre, as humans say in French. Why then shouldn’t the opposite also be the case: that human language is essentially animal, from the point of view of the ludic capacities it carries, so intimately bound up with its metalinguistic powers? Think of humor. Why not consider human language a reprise of animal play, raised to a higher power? Or say that it is actually in language that the human reaches its highest degree of animality? Didn’t Deleuze and Guattari insist that it is in writing that the human “becomes-animal” most intensely, that is, enters most intensely into a zone of indiscernibility with its own animality (Deleuze and Guattari 1986, 12–15, 34–38; 1987, 237–248, 256–260; see also Supplement 1 below)?
