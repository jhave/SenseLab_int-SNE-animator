Context is a general concept. It has to do with what is embedded in place in a general way particular to that placeâ€”that is, in a way that applies generally to what occurs there. What occurs is then taken to be adequately understood as a particular instance of the general rule. When the imperatives in place in a given context are analyzed, it is typically in terms of the formal and informal codes governing interactions on the ground and the roles conventionally associated with them. A code is an abstraction whose ruling form generally preexists the particulars of its contextual enactment (this is true even when the code is combinatory or generative in the structuralist sense). A situation, on the other hand, has to do not with particularity, but with singularity.
