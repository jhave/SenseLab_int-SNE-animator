Bateson uses his theory of play in order to construct his definition of the pathological (1972, 190–193). He sees pathology as being closely related to the problems posed by the operation of framing. In the final analysis, he says, the operation of framing is not so much visual (the analogy of the painting) nor formally logical (concerning rules of category formation and classification). It is “psychological” (186). That is to say, in the vocabulary of the present essay, it is appetitive: concerning the “mental” movement of lived abstraction as it tends to surpass the given in the direction of creativity, and as it pertains to subjectivities-without-a-subject. The need to double the framing, as a security mechanism for maintaining the separation between categories, “is related to a preference for avoiding the paradoxes of abstraction” (189): the paradoxes, we would say here, of lived abstraction. Guarding the structural border against creative mutual inclusion is a way of avoiding at all costs the surpassing of the given toward which lived abstraction, animated by the supernormal tendency, propels us. But the structural opposite of guarding of the structural border is just another way of expressing this same “preference”—call it desire—for avoiding the creative movement of life, this time by suspending it in a zone of indifference rather than excising it as the excluded middle.
