First, the becoming-animal of the human is entered upon by necessity. The exemplary case for Deleuze and Guattari is Kafka. It is in the face of the horror of the human home and family that Kafka takes refuge in animal existential territories. The condensation of affect on the all-toohuman figures of the Oedipal family is felt to be unlivably limiting. Writing, pushed into supernormal service as a toolbox for becoming-animal, is used to compose a line of flight from the family enclosure. The recourse to animality is a strategy of survival. The necessity of the recourse does not contradict its creativity. The fact that the becoming-animal is entered into under pressure does not disqualify it as a fundamentally ludic operation. In the becoming-animal of the human, creativity and survival are one. If the situation were not imperative, there would be no reason not to remain ensconced in the familiar comforts of home.
