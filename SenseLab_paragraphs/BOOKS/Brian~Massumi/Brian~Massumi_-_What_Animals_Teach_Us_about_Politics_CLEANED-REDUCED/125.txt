11. Animal politics is a pragmatics of mutual inclusion. This mutual inclusion even applies, or especially applies, to the generic difference between the human and the animal. Generic differences, such as the separation between animal species, belong to the logic of mutual exclusion. When something exceeds or escapes containment in its assigned generic category, its singularity appears, in the logic of mutual exclusion, as a negative, as a lack or deficiency. The only alternative is between being subsumed under the proper category and indifference: between generic identity and undifferentiation, too rigid distinction or indistinction. Generic difference is not really about difference: it is about mutually exclusive identities. The animal thinking-doing of politics refuses to recognize generic difference as foundational, precisely in order to think the singular. Its natural logic of mutual inclusion—the paradoxical logic of that which interpenetrates without losing its distinction—is designed to avoid the infernal alternative between identity and undifferentiation.
