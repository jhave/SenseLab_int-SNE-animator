We now have all the pieces in place to broach the subject of what animals teach us about politics. But it is important to be clear. It is in no way a question of rethinking politics on the model of the game. Itâ€™s just not about modeling at all. What animals teach us about politics bears the same relation to the modeling of play as the ludic gesture bears to what it would denote. What it is is a question of metamodelization, just as in play it is a question of metacommunication.42 What is necessary is to open and maintain a gap between the theory of animal play from which this reflection has unfolded, and the politics that might flow from it. For this task, there is no interest in dallying in any supposed dialectic between play and combat. The reciprocal deterritorialization through which play extends itself can straddle several domains of activity, and extends into interspecies relations (as in symbiosis). The in-between is many-faceted. The betweentwo, which dialectics takes as primary, is in fact a limit-case.
Instead of modeling play, it is a question of extracting from play that which in play surpasses its givenness. It is necessary to extract the ludic from play, in order to stage it in an even more extended and autonomous manner. It is necessary to put the ludic into an even intenser movement of transformation, vibrating with an even more vivacious and encompassing enthusiasm of the body. It is necessary to do this with performative thought-gestures.
