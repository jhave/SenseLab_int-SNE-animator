Humans may also practice effective paradox, when they permit themselves to abandon themselves to play. In play, the human enters a zone of indiscernibility with the animal. When we humans say “this is play,” we are assuming our animality. Play dramatizes the reciprocal participation of the human and the animal, from both sides. For when animals play, they are preparatorily enacting human capacities. Bateson says that in our usual assumptions we get the evolutionary order wrong, thinking that metacommunication must come after the denotative communication it complicates. In fact, “denotative communication as it occurs at the human level is only possible after the evolution of a complex set of metalinguistic (but not verbalized) rules which govern how words and sentences shall be related to objects and events. It is therefore appropriate to look for the evolution of such metalinguistic and/or metacommunicative rules at a prehuman and preverbal level” (180).
