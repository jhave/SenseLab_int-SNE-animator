This is nothing less than the process of nature, in its widest sense. Thus it is not simply a question of choosing one over the other, taking creative self-surpassing over dependence on the already-expressed, because each gives affordance to the other. Lived importance gives creativity something to finesse, and creativity returns the favor with a yield of newly minted givens. The given and what surpasses it are joined at the gestural hip in a cycle of coproduction, each in its own way destined for the other. Affirming one is tantamount to affirming the cycle of life in which they are mutually included.
