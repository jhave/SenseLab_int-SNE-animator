6. “It is the mark that makes the territory” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 315). This is a way of saying that the enactive map creates the territory. Do not fall prey to the commonsense assumption that what is in play preexists as an already constituted subject, in functional interaction with similarly preconstituted objects in a preplotted spatial frame. For one thing, “functions in a territory are not primary” (315). For another, the frame is always exceeded in lived abstraction. The performance of the expressive act sets in motion the surpassing space of its own operation—although it is not so much a space as a space-time. A creative cartography enacts the processual space-time of its own unfolding. There is no subject behind the creative act, existing prior to the process. The subject is always ahead of itself, in the movement of expression. The subject is a “superject”8 that is always to come, or already surpassed in a next pulse of life. The self-driving movement of expression is essentially a subjectivity-without-a-subject. This in no way means that there are only objects, as object-oriented ontology would have it. There is, at bottom, only activity and tendency, bearing on qualitative blocks of plastic relation under variation. Finally, do not let the trope of “embodied” cognition mislead you into thinking of the body as waiting, with the infinite patience of dumb matter, to incarnate a mind. If everything is alive, it is because the expressive gestures of nature go a-bodying. Bodyings-without-“the”-body, for subjectivities-withouta-subject. If everything is alive, it is because life lives its own abstraction— its every gesture a pragmatic speculation on nature in the making.
