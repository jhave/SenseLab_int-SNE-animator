The key to the operation is a conversion of the dominant affect of the situation. The horror of the visible stifling of the animals’ vitality is converted into fun—in large part the fun of recognizing oneself in the other. Of course, the operation does not always succeed. The children who are its main targets are often those least able to disregard the horror and unsee the singularity of the animal, while their accompanying adults, hungry for an entertaining break from the hard work of raising the next generation of normopaths, histrionically add their efforts to the identificatory dosing. When it does succeed, what we see is a staging of the structural cynicism of human politics. The cynicism consists in papering over the structural barbarity of its inclusive exclusion with an applied humanizing surface. This is an example of the kind of anthropomorphizing that roundly deserves denunciation.
