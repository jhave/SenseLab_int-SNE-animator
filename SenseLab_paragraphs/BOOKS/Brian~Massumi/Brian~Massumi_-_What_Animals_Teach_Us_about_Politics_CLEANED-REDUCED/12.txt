The force of the ludic gesture is a force of passage which induces a qualitative change in the nature of the situation. Two individuals are transported at one and the same time, but without changing location, by an instantaneous force of transformation. They are taken up in a transformation in place that does not affect one without affecting the other. The ludic gesture releases a force of transindividual transformation. The immediacy of the transformation that the gestureâ€™s execution induces qualifies the ludic gesture as a performative act. Play is made of performative gestures exerting a transindividual force.
