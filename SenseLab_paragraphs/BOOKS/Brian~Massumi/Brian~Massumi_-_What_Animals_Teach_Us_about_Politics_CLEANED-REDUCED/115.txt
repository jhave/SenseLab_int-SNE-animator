9. The ethico-aesthetic paradigm of animal politics is particularly attentive to modes of thought enacted in nonverbal gestures. But this special attentiveness to lived abstraction on nonverbal levels in no way implies a negligence of language. As we have seen, the instinctive acts of animals already include language in potential, in their ludic element. The vital gestures of animal play display a reflexivity in-the-act that really produces the conditions of human language. Animal politics, and its metamodelization, make language play. To play language means making instinctive usage of it. The instinctive usage of language consists in a gestural employment of words as catalyzers of language acts effecting direct transformations-inplace that shake up corporeality and rally appetition, propelling life activity in the direction of transsituational variation.52
