“Sympathy,” “creativity”: for many, whenever these words occur in too close proximity to “animal,” alarm bells ring. The accusation of anthropomorphism rings next. When the task is undertaken to integrate into the concept of nature notions such as these, so long marginalized by the dominant currents in evolutionary biology, animal behavior, and philosophy, there is little hope of dodging that accusation. The problem is the qualitative character of the terms. “Qualitative” suggests “subjective.” Just to utter these words gives what David Chalmers called “the hard problem” of consciousness a foot in the door, an uninvited guest lurking at the threshold of the halls of science (Chalmers 1995). The question becomes one not only of animal behavior but of animal thought, and its distance from or proximity to those capacities over which we human animals assert a monopoly, and on which we hang our inordinate pride in our species being: language and reflexive consciousness.
