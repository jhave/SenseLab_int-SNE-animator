In play, it is precisely a question of intensification. The envelopment in a nonfighting field of what is proper to the arena of combat packs the situation. Each act carries a double charge of reality, as what is being done is infused with what would be doing. The situation’s actuality swells with possibility. Communication complicates itself with metacommunication. Each ludic gesture is loaded with these differences of level, situation, and mode of active existence. This intensification is brought about by the suspension of traditional logic as governed by the principle of the excluded middle. But it makes play much more than the simple breakdown of that logic. It effects a passage to a pragmatics where a different logic is directly embodied in action, flush with gesture. This other logic is nothing if not performed, nothing if not lived out. The form of abstraction staged in play is a lived abstraction (Massumi 2011a, 15–19, 42–43, 146–158, and passim).
