Gregory Bateson recounts that his reflections on play were inspired by a visit to a San Francisco zoo. Two monkeys playing with each other drew his attention. That their ludic actions were “similar to but not the same as those of combat” was “evident, even to a human observer” (Bateson 1972, 179). Bateson’s analyses stem from this observation of play, including an observation of the inclusion in the scene of the human observer. However, in the rest of his essay Bateson never returns to the issue of the inclusion of the human observer and the “evidence” of what it sees. It is as if, against everything he says about play and reflexivity and language, he reverts on this point to the unreflexive assumption that the animal and its evolutionary relation to the human can simply be denoted, the presence of the human observer absentmindedly placed under erasure. What would animality denote if one of the things it didn’t denote was this forgetting? Where is the play in Bateson’s own observation-based analysis? The animal politics of play needs to confront these questions revolving around spectatorship.
