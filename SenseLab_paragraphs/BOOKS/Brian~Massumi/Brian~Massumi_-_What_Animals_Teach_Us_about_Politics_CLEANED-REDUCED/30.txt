The standing-for of the play gesture makes play an expressive activity, essentially in excess over function. Playâ€™s quality of animation, the surplus-value of life it performs with enthusiasm of the body, overspills instrumentality. Its yield by nature exceeds the functional use-value of its analog acts. The play act opens a gap between its own situational force and the functionality of the analogs it plays upon, and loads the gap with the purely expressive value of standing-for. This is a precarious maneuver that may fly off the tracks at any moment.
