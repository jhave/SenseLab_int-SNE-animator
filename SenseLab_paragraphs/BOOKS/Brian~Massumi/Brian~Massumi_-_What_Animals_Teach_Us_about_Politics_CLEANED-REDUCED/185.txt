“It is probable,” writes Bateson, “that not only histrionics but also spectatorship should be included within this field” of play (182). If spectatorship is part of the field of play, then we cannot consider it a one-way street. As Bateson underlines, in the field of play it is always a question of different roles mutually included in the same “complex.” The complex mutually includes triggering actions and their “reciprocal”: the actions of the other or others brought into play by the transindividual force of the transformation-in-place the ludic gesture enacts (181–182). As applied to spectatorship, this principle has important implications. Rather than a one-way street, spectatorship has to be understood as a relation. The relation must be understood as reciprocal, as a bidirectional activity straddling the differential between the roles that come together in counterpoint. This means that all involved are in some way active participants, in spite of the ostensible monopoly of activity on one side or another (in theater, the side of the performers; at the zoo, the side of the ambulating, projectively identifying viewers). There is no passive player. Play is a dynamic complex, an integral field of differential action, diversely cohering in mutual inclusion.
