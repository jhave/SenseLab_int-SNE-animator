Tinbergen himself says as much. A cuckoo chick, he explains, possesses supernormal traits encouraging the female of another species whose nest the cuckoo parasitizes to take it under its wing and nourish it. The host female, Tinbergen remarks, isn’t “willing” to feed the invader. No, she positively “loves” to do it (1965, 67). She does not do it grudgingly, she does it positively with passion. The force of the supernormal is a positive force. Far from being a mechanistic impulsion, it is a passionate propulsion. Spontaneous propulsion / mental power to surpass the given: appetition (Whitehead 1978, 33). Ruyer uses the term “auto-conduction” (self-driving) for this self-propulsion of animal life immanent to the movement of instinct (Ruyer 1958, 17, 214; 1953, 127–129). Instinct bears witness to a selfdriving of life’s creative movement: to a self-expressive autonomy of vital creativity.
