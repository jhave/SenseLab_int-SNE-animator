We require that [ . . . ] the notion of life should involve the notion of physical nature. [ . . . ] Neither physical nature nor life can be understood unless we fuse them together as essential factors in the composition of “really real” things whose interconnections and individual characters constitute the universe. (Whitehead 1968, 150)
Post-pronouncements aside, what is required is a concept of universal activity, naturally self-driving in a bid for freedom, extending the mutual inclusion of animality, life, and consciousness, as of instinct, intuition, and spontaneity, toward the speculative limit of lived abstraction, fusing physical nature with the mental power to surpass the given.
