“Like” a rat flicks its tail. “Like” a bird sings. “Like” a cat sleeps. “Like,” here, does not denote what it “would denote” metaphorically (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 274). It does not denote, in the purest of nonmetaphorical expression. Becoming, Deleuze and Guattari say, requires the abolition of metaphor (1987, 69, 273–274). Far from being a metaphor, becominganimal is a real participation against nature, following nature’s own supernormal tendency, supercharged into a movement to the absolute limit.
