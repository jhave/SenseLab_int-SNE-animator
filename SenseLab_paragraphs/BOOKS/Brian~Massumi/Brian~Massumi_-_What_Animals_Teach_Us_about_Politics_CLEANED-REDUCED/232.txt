4. Don’t be mistaken into thinking that the more-than-human is outside, surrounding the human, in the environment. The more-than-human is also in the very makeup of the human. For the human body is an animal body, and animality is immanent to human life (and vice versa). The farther down one goes into the composition of the animal body, the more levels of unhumanness one finds. Chemical and physical processes nest in the animal body, surrendering to it nothing of their otherness even as they contribute to composing it. The physiological processes in continual operation within the body contribute level upon level of nonconscious feeling in-forming action and awareness. Think only of the way in which the “gut brain” of the enteric nervous system modulates conscious experience, or of the background inflections of affect by the hormones, or of the ongoing orienting of experience by the proprioceptive system, or of the learnedness of what is popularly called “muscle memory” or, more to the point of this essay, instinct. All of these are by nature nonconscious.
