The accusation of anthropomorphism is launched in the name of respecting difference. You’re talking about animal thought? Animal affects and emotions? Animal desire? Animal creativity? Animal subjectivity even? Projection, pure difference-denying projection. Nothing but a lack of respect for the radical differences between modes of existence— yet another act of anthropocentric domination erasing the difference of the “other.” Animal politics does not set much store by such critiques. They are still laboring within the traditional logic according to which the only alternative to mutual exclusion is undifferentiation, in this case in the guise of a putative projective confusion. This alternative is only hardened by the notion of “radical” difference.
