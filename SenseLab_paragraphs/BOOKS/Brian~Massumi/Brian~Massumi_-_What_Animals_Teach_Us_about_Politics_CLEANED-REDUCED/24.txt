It all hinges on the minimal difference between the ludic gesture and the analogous gesture that it invokes, and in turn inhabits it. It is all in the gap between the bite and the nip, moving and gamboling, executing an action and dramatizing it. What pries open the minimal difference, enabling the mutual inclusion characterizing the logic of play, is once again style. The difference between a fight bite and a play bite is not just the intensity of the act in the quantitative sense: how hard the teeth clamp down. The difference is qualitative. The ludic gesture is performed with a mischievous air, with an impish exaggeration or misdirection, or on the more nuanced end of the spectrum, a flourish, or even a certain understated grace modestly calling attention to the spirit in which the gesture is proffered.6 A ludic gesture in a play fight is not content to be the same as its analogue in combat. It is not so much “like” a combat move as it is combatesque: like in combat, but with a little something different, a little something more. With a surplus: an excess of energy or spirit.
