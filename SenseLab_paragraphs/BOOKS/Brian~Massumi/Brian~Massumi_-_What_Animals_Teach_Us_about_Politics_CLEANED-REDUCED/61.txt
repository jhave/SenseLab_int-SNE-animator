Bateson underlines the fact that there is one factor that is not touched by the suspension effected by the play-gesture’s placing the ensuing activity in the conditional mode. That factor is affect. Even though a frightening ludic gesture does not denote what it would denote, it still provokes “the same terror” (Bateson 1972, 254). This is also the case, Bateson notes, for cinematic images. The scaryesque inspires fright. Ludic gestures, Bateson says, are “pure mood-signs” (253): pure signs of affect. When we say “pure” in relation to a sign, it can only mean a sign whose sense is inseparable from its performance, and thus whose expression is inseparable from its content. Pure signs are nondenotative signs that refer to nothing outside their own enactment, that are one with the enactment of their meaning. Pure signs are pure events, simultaneously reflexive (metacommunicational) and relational (occasioning a mutual inclusion of levels, forms, and arenas of activity). As always in play, denotation, highly artificed and constitutively struck with paradox, is eminently suspect. However, this does not prevent it from being true—affectively true. The truth of play is of an affective order.
