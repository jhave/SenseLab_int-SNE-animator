Corporeality is not separable from the action, or from the action’s dynamic form of expression which is vitality affect. Corporeality is the immediately felt “aboutness” of that expression of vitality. Its absorption of aboutness ties its genesis to categorical affect. Corporeality arises with categorical affect’s feeling of obligatory anchoring in the situation, and the palpability of the imperatives that come with the territory. The obligatory, the imperative: the important. Corporeality is lived importance. Vitality affect, it was said earlier, corresponds to lived abstraction and the deterritorialization associated with its playing out. Corporeality as lived importance is a necessary accompaniment to the vital play of abstraction that gives the situation what degrees of freedom may be -esqued out of it.
