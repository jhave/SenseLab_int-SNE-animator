Considered from this angle, the expression of supernormal tendency in the dynamic form of vitality affect is a veritable serial production of importanceâ€” a continuing reinvention of what is important to life. This means that a pure form of expression, whether it slithers on its belly or is written by hand, carries potential import. The escapes it invents in intensity herald important lifeways still to come. A ludically pure expression occupies a zone of indiscernibility between the serious and the frivolous. When it is taken seriously, it can come across sounding frivolous. But when it is belittled, it gets overlooked that there is something extra stirring, already coiled, ready to bite.
