The other difference in relation to animal play is that here the deterritorialization is “absolute” (1986, 26, 35–36). That is to say, the unframing opens an escape hatch leading away from all known arenas of activity given in nature. Becoming-animal is the never before seen, the never done or previously felt. A dog tying its shoes. A mouse star of the opera. A most learned ape savant.1 Never done, never been, not in the past, nor likely in the future. It is a transindividual affair of the people, but “the people are missing” (Deleuze 1989, 221–222) by nature.
