Play as an independent activity in its own right presupposes the territory. The territory is among its necessary conditions. Wolf cubs can only afford to abandon themselves to play in the proximity of the den that provides them safety from predation until they are big enough to become predators themselves. But play is not only conditioned by the territory, it is an operation on the territory. It is an operation of lived abstraction in which territorial functions are at the same time actively invoked and paradoxically placed in suspense, to novel effect.
