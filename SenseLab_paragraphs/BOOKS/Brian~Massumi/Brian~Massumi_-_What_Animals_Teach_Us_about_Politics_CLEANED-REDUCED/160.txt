Written becoming-animal is the integral event of instinctive animality, in-acted in a passage to the absolute limit of the given. It is the lived abstraction of animal life, singularly unlimited. A pure and necessary expression of the inexpressible in becoming.
Is this a way out, if it comes in so pure an expression as to be effectively in suspense? Never directly. Never in a way that can be directly applied to solving the problems posed by unlivable necessity. But perhaps, just possibly, the pure expression will have invented a commanding form of intensest escape that might come spontaneously, from nowhere expressible, to in-form a dire situation, intuitively welling up from the immanence of the animal at a critical point, inwardly resonating toward a newly emergent acting-out. Then, the task changes: to pick up a weapon in the movement of escape, to fight recapture (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 204). Or more relationally and pragmatically, to find a tool (1987, 187, 189). Not a tool that does work. A tool that invents. A tool for constructing the conditions enabling the movement of escape to continue to avoid capture by making a practice of its own abduction, becoming self-abducting, serially self-inducing its own forward-pulling, gesture by thinking-doing gesture, pursuing itself as an intuitively self-driving tendency, blazing a trail, with equal measures of improvisational prowess and technique, toward as-yet-unknown existential territories, never before seen, holding the supernormal animal potential to house that heralded people to come in open-ranging nature, self-surpassing within an ever-expanding horizon of possibility. Speculative-pragmatic autonomy of expression, carried to the highest, most politicized, transindividual power, no longer just becominganimal, but -revolutionary: surplus-value of life, most far-reachingly lived in integral intensity.
