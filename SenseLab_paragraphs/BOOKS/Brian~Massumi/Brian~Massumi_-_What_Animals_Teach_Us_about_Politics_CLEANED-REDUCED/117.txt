The logic of mutual inclusions knows nothing of exclusive oppositions. It recognizes contrasts aplenty, but the contrastive terms are always understood to be in a relation of reciprocal presupposition as modalities of action differentially belonging to the same process; in a word, as dynamisms. As contributing factors to the process, the contrasting dynamisms interlace without their difference being effaced. They performatively fuse without becoming confused. In their differing dynamism, they are modal factors: modes of activity. Being modal factors of activity, they are essentially in movement. Although it is sometimes necessary to construe their contrast in terms of differences of degree on a qualitative continuum of activity, or even as differences of kind entering into various mixtures, the way in which they are ultimately distinguished is by the orientation of their movement. In other words, they are best treated as tendencies.
