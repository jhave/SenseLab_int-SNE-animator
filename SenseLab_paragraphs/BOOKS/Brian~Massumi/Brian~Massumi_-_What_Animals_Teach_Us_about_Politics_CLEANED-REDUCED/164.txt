At first sight, the visit to the zoo that is the primal scene for the development of Bateson’s theory would seem to be the antithesis of play. True, the content of the observation is a play scene. But that’s precisely the problem: the scene is contained, in the literal sense of being enclosed in a cage. As developed in the present essay, the notion of mutual inclusion is that of an enactive gesture of double deterritorialization. In Bateson’s text, it plays out in more logical and, at the same time, more visual terms. Bateson speaks at length about framing, referring concretely to the frame of a painting, and more abstractly to the gesture of maintaining a wellordered separation between categories of beings and between the logical and metalogical levels involved in that task (Bateson 1972, 187–189). In both cases, the visual and the logical, it’s a question of exclusion by inclusion. The frame of the painting includes a certain number of visual elements organized as a perceptual gestalt. Inclusion in the frame foregrounds the painted figures appearing there, setting them off against the background formed by what the frame excludes. A visual framing is also a logical framing. It is “an instruction to the viewer that he should not extend the premises which obtain between the figures within the picture to the wall paper behind it” (1972, 189).
