The main point is that the child does not place itself in the form of the tiger, nor does it place the form of the tiger in itself (which in identificatory terms amounts to the same thing, depending on whether one looks at from the angle of the human projection onto the animal, or the backprojection from the animal returning the human’s identificatory gesture to itself ). The child places itself in the field of transindividual tension of the situation, polarized in counterpoint composition.15 In the child’s intuitively visionary play, the point of the tiger in-forms the counterpoint of the child’s becoming-tiger. The relation is immanent. It is not one of action-reaction in the usual sense, which connotes extrinsic relation. What is at play is an immanent relation of modulation. The child does not imitate the tiger at a distance. The child is in-tigered, in infinite, lived proximity to tigritude.
