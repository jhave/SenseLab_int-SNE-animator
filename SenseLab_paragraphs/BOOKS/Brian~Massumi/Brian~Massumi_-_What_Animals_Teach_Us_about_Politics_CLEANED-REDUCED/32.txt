It is undeniable that play has a role in learning, and that the learning serves adaptive ends. It is less clear that this means that the relation of play to its analog arenas is essentially one of conformal subordination. The stylistic excess of play, its -esqueness, corresponds not only to a little something extra that gives its gestures flourish, but to a power of variation. The form of the gesture is deformed, more or less subtly, under pressure from the enthusiasm of the body propelling it. In the deformation, the analog form takes new form. The gap between the ludic gesture and its analogue creates a margin of maneuver: it opens the door to improvisation. Play is the arena of activity dedicated to the improvisation of gestural forms, a veritable laboratory of forms of live action. What is played at is invention. The aesthetic yield of the play comes with an active mobilization of improvisational powers of variation. Surplus-value of life equals surplus-value of inventiveness.
