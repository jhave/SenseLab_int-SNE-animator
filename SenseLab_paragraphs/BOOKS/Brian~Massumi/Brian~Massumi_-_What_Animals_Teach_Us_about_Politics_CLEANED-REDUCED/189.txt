Sympathy, it was earlier argued, does not operate from the point of view of a given participant. It is not an individual anchoring in the situation from a particular angle. It is perspective of all the angles’ situational reciprocity. It is less a situated perspective than a situational perspective: an immanent survey of the differential mutual inclusion of the potential actions of all those gestured into the event just triggering. We saw that the reaction of one participant was already potentially included in the action of the other, present in germ in the -esqueness of the ludic gesture. Sympathy is this transindividual immediacy. As earlier discussed, in Ruyer’s terminology, the situational perspective enacted in the sympathetic act is called “absolute survey.” This is an integral encompassing of the situation in thinking-doing, in the immediacy of the situation, without the vantage point of a supplementary dimension from which to look into or down upon the situation as from without. Sympathy is the immanent inbetween of the situation, directly felt in the thinking-doing of the coming action.
