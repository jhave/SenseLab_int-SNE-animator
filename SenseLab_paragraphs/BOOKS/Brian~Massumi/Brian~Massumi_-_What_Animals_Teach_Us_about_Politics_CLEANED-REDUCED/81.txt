It may not have escaped notice that the definitions of instinct and intuition crisscross—as all the distinctions deployed in this essay inevitably do. Instinct already bears the supernormal tendency—albeit in a hallucinatory mode if left to its own devices—whose accentuation defines intuition. And intuition already bears a polarity between supernormal tendency and corporeality—albeit of a different tense, present rather than past. As always, it is not a question of the cut-and-dried logic of category separation and its self-frustrating law of the excluded middle. It is always a gesturally fresh question of the differential mutual inclusion of coimplicating processual correlates.
