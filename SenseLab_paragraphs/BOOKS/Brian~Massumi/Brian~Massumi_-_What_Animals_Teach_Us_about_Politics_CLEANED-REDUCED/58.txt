The concept of the existential territory is more encompassing than that of the territory in the strict sense. It refers to the territory in the physical sense but also takes in the dynamic forms, the forms of activity, that use the physical territory as the springboard for becoming. It further includes the mental relations between territories in play, and between the dynamic forms the territories host. The existential territory is a block of lived space-time, in which life thinks itself as it plays variation. The concept of existential territory also, and especially, refers to the stylistic composition of vital activities, including the instantaneous back-and-forths between their disparate arenas effecting a reciprocal modulation of those arenas, in such a way as to potentially prolong them evolutionarily (see Deleuze and Guattari 1987, ch. 11).
