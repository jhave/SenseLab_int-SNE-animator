3. Do not prophesy with too much gravitas the end of the human and the dawn of a posthuman age. Such pronouncements must often assume the ability to categorically separate the human from the animal. Even if the human is understood to be in reciprocal presupposition with the animal, transcending the human is also to transcend the animal. To invoke the posthuman is to invoke the postanimal. But then, if the animal is imbued with consciousness, so that consciousness and animal life come together, as Ruyer and Bergson have it, the postanimal would be the postvital as well. That means that in order to arrive at the sought-after post-, it would be necessary to tear consciousness and life from their existing existential territories of the human and the animal, and confide them in technology. Post-ing thus arrives at the already quite weather-worn notion of the cyborg as prosthetic life—life radically displaced and prolonged beyond its end. However, the image of the hyperfunctional cyborg is as often as not outmaneuvered in popularity by the plodding of the living dead. The cascade of posts-—human, animal, vital—bloodlessly drains into the zombie. But in the zombie, consciousness dims. So not so very much has been gained, and more than warm blood has been lost.
