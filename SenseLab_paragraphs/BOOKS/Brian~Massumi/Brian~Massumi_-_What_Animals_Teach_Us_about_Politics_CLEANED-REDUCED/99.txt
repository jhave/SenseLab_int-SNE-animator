Surpassing normative ethics requires refraining from dividing these two tendencies against each other, in an attempt to exclude one of them (the supernormal, of course). What it suggests instead is to find ways to collectively inhabit the dynamic in-between of their processual interlacing, in order to compose with their difference, recognizing the necessity for survival of the anchoring in lived importance, all the while pulling the gestural strings activating the processual primacy of lived abstraction in the genesis of forms of life. Considering the cycle that dynamically joins these two poles of life’s collective bodying, it is as accurate to say that the supernormalizing movement of vital inventiveness is in the service of the production of lived importance in emergent variations, as it is to say that lived abstraction is in forward flight away from the imperatives that come with lived importance. It’s a matter of perspective. It’s like the debate in neo-Darwinian theory about whether the gene is in the service of the unique life of organism, or the organism is in the service of the reproduction of the gene. The logical mutually inclusive answer is both the one and the other (and the not exactly either—the one, the two, and the included middle of the processual zone of indiscernibility).
