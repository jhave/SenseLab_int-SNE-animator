If on the animal continuum it is always a question of mutual inclusion, it is necessary to articulate the mode of inclusion of the human in the animal, and the animal in the human. In the case of the zoo, as well as in other contexts where humans work to hold themselves at a distance in the role of unimplicated observer, whether it be in the field, in the laboratory, or in front of a screen, it is visibly an issue of a rigidly exclusionary operation. Mutual inclusion would seem to be the last concept you would turn to to understand what is in play in these circumstances. But it is precisely these circumstances that predominate in human-animal  encounters  in  our age, lately christened the Anthropocene. Exemplary becomings-animal, without functional aim or final destination, might easily seem beside the point in the context of this predominance of situations where the animal is reduced to the status of an object for a purportedly uninvolved observing human, so often to the detriment to the animalâ€™s vitality, if not to its survival pure and simple.
