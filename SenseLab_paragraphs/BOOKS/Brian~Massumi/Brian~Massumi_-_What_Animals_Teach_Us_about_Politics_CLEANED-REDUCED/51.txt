A philosophy of nature must take into account this primacy of selfvarying expressivity, as well as its processual autonomy as a self-driving tendency. Its primacy must be recognized even where animal life is most firmly entrenched in the frame of its environment, with all the accidents and imperatives that come with that. Many animals entrench themselves in a territory. The proprietary occupation of a territory provides the instincts with a dedicated milieu for their unfolding, but under very particular conditions. Interspecific aggression, intraspecific gregarity, and courtship behavior are all territorial functions, as is, for that matter, the feeding behavior of the cuckoo and the gull, which presupposes a nest. From the perspective advanced here, our understanding of territorial functions must take into account the ways in which the unfolding of entrenched instinctive behaviors may nevertheless surpass their functional anchoring. Courtship, the territorial function around which most discussions of evolutionary exuberance revolve, would be just one particular case. Play, once again, provides the privileged angle of attack.
