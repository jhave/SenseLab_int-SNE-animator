Returning to play in the narrow sense, the instantaneous back-andforth it effects between the present and futurity does the footwork for another stretch—that of the inventiveness of play-fighting stretching into the form of combat itself, across the zone of indiscernibility of their mutual inclusion. The variations on combat that are improvised in play might well lead to an evolution of its dynamic form. This is the idea, already discussed, that the game does not model itself on combat so much as combat modulates itself in play, flush with the gestures composing its enactive cartography. These cartographic gestures have the potential to reconfigure the arena of activity of combat, just as the gull chick’s impetuous peck might eventually lead to a reconfiguration of a physical territory. In the instantaneous back-and-forth between the present of play and the future of combat, a circuit of exchange is established by which play comes to express itself in combat, because combat came to express itself in play. This exchange occurs across their difference in communicative level, form, and type, as well as across the distance that separates playing from fighting as disparate arenas of activity, each with its own spatial and temporal parameters—or in the vocabulary of Félix Guattari, as different existential territories (Guattari 1995, 26–28, 53, and passim).
