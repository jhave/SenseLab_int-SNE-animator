It is actually imprecise to say that the inclusive exclusion of the zoeological animal is not paradoxical. In a way, it lends itself only too well to paradox. But it is not the kind of paradox that has figured so prominently in this study. It is not the productive paradox of the performative setting into motion of a creative zone of indiscernibility in which differences cooccur without coalescing, enactively fuse without becoming confused, in a dynamic proximity catapulting life into a transindividual movement of surpassing the given in the direction of the new. On the contrary, it is a sterile paradox that merely consists in a blurring of categories. What are suspended in that case are not normative functions, as in play, but difference itself. Furthermore, the suspension is not enactive but merely logical.2 The fundamental difference that blurs is the distinction “between the outside and inside” (Agamben 1995, 19). In other words, the sterile paradox in question does not concern the dynamism of life in its processuality; rather, it concerns structure, whose constitutive feature is the drawing of a boundary between the inside and outside, demarcating what the structure includes in its offset figure from what it leaves in the background shadow of its environment. The “zone of indistinction” or indifference (Agamben 1995, 19) resulting from a blurring of this demarcation is the simple opposite of structure. It is the undifferentiated background against which the structure’s figural difference from its environment stands out.
