1. Do not presume that you have access to a criterion for categorically separating the human from the animal. The criterion most widely called into service is language. If culture is assimilated to language, as it so often is, then it too falls into the exclusive province of the human. However, as we have seen, language is already present in potential in animal play. Animal play, in fact, produces the real conditions of emergence of language. Since these conditions concern life’s reflexive powers, a mode or degree of consciousness is already in force. So don’t get it into your head that consciousness will provide the dividing line. Consider that human language, in its most elaborated forms, deploying its most purely expressive powers of invention, rather than separate from the animal, instinctively returns to it, in the supernormal manner to which the animal life has always been accustomed to surpass itself.
