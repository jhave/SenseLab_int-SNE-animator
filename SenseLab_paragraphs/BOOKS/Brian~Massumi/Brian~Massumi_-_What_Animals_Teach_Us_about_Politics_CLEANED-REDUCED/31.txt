One might object that play does indeed have a function. It was, in fact, already mentioned: playing plays a learning role. According to prevailing opinions, when an animal engages in play fighting it is training for real combat later on. By this account, the play is formally modeled on its analog arena of activity: to be useful for training, the form of the play fight moves must closely enough resemble those of combat. Play’s instrumental service to future function dictates that its guiding principle be that its form conform. It doesn’t truly carry an expressive force, dedicated as it is to adaptive function. It is fundamentally in the service of the war of all against all. It must be understood in terms of simple survival value, not the aesthetic production of surplus-value of life.
