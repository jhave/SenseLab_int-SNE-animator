How is an animal politics to deal with the human politics of this zooological structure, given that its own preferred strategy is not denunciation? Denunciation is sometimes necessary, but it is never enough. Animal politics always looks for a way to leverage creativity even out of the most tightly closed, denunciation-worthy situations, opening a crack through which the supernormal tendency can wriggle free, in forward flight toward the surpassing of the given. Where can such an opening possibly be found in the humanized face of the animal’s structural confinement? In the animals’ lockdown into utter dependence on what is zoo-ologically given to it? In the animal’s corporeal enslavement to the hand (or opposable thumb) it has been dealt, tempered only by an overlay of sentimental cynicism? These questions all come down to one: in what way, in spite of it all, is the zoo-ological still ludic?
