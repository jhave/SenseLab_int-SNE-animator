The logic of mutual inclusion dodges the infernal alternative between the solitude of generic differences and the goo of undifferentiation upon which these accusations of anthropomorphism are implictly based. It places the human on a continuum with the animal precisely in order better to respect the proliferation of differences: the movement of nature by which life always goes a-differing. It easily turns the accusation of anthropomorphism against the accusers. Is it not the height of human arrogance to suppose that animals do not have thought, emotion, desire, creativity, or subjectivity? Is that not to consign animals yet again to the status of automatons? Even the agnostic position on these questions gives too much credence to the mechanist model of animal life. The agnostic position consists simply in refusing to pronounce on the issues, avowedly out of a respect for difference, but one that is overwrought, verging on piety. But is not to remain silent on the nature of differences dangerously close to silencing difference? What lack of respect! And if animal thought, emotion, desire, creativity, and subjectivity are in fact affirmed, but without the hard philosophical work of reexamining the very logic of difference, it results in an all-too-easy pluralism based on all-too-human tolerance. The barbed accusation of anthropomorphism misses its target, and sees its arrow turn back against itself.
