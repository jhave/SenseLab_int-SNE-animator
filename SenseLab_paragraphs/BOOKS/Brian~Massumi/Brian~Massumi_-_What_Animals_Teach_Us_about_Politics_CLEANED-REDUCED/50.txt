Adaptability and creativity come together, without the difference between them ever erasing. In the process of evolution, their tendential operations interlace without losing their distinctness. They effectively meld, without coalescing. Ontogenetically speaking—that is, from the point of view of the genesis of forms, the origination of their variation—it must be said that the primacy is on the side of the creative element in instinct, as the mental motor of the movement of life’s forms’ becoming. This is because the supernormal tendency embodies a positive desire for variation. It is through that tendency that the appetite for life affirms variation. In nature “the initial fact is the primordial appetition” (Whitehead 1978, 48). Adaptation gives the supernormal tendency a pass, so that it continues down the road—or not. Selective adaptation exercises a checkpoint control whose power comes from the imposition of extrinsic constraints and which takes the form of a life or death sentence. It imposes the law of the given as a necessity of survival. The final control it exerts over what passes or doesn’t in terms of novel variations amounts to a normative judgment. It amounts to a conformity test, a fitness test vis-à-vis the laws of necessity built into already-given conditions. Still, in the long run, what wins out is the improvisational power of supernormal variation that pulls forward beyond the given, toward an excess of lived quality. Its propulsivity takes primacy as originator of the forms of life submitted to the normative judgment of adaptive selection. For corroboration of the excessiveness of this inventive impetus, it is enough to take a quick look around at the boundless exuberance of nature everywhere on display, of which the instinctive gesture’s enthusiasm of the body is the exemplary expression. The story of evolution is a mad proliferation of forms so fertile as to defy the human imagination.
