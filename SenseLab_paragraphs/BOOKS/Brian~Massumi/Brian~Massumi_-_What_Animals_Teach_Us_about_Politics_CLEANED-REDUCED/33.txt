If this were not the case, the fight would be lost. It is actually the power of variation learned in play, the improvisational prowess it hones, that gives an animal the upper hand in combat or, to cite another example, in flight from a predator. A gesture whose form is modeled as a function of a recognized instrumental end is one that is normalized in advance of its deployment. A normalized gesture is a predictable gesture. If learning were limited to modeling the form of an instinctive act in advance of its instrumental deployment, it would be dangerously maladaptive. It would model its pupils to death. Ruyer holds that the power to improvise is a necessary dimension of all instinct.
