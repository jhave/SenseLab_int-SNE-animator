As in nonhuman animal play, the actions to which the narrator abandons himself “do not denote what those actions for which they stand would denote.” As with every ludic operation, becoming-animal dramatizes the affective situation by performing gestures that have bite without biting. Paradoxically, it is not the Oedipal horror of incest that Kafka dramatizes, even though that horror cannot but be evoked. What is dramatized is the unframing of incest and its horror. The becoming-animal of the narrator suspends Oedipal desire, the sequence of actions most associated with it, as well as the known consequences of either engaging in them or repressing them. Gregor’s becoming-animal defangs the Oedipal family by giving it pure, deterritorializing expression. “There appears at the same time the possibility of an escape, a line of flight” (Deleuze and Guattari 1986, 12; trans. modified). Gregor’s becoming-cockroach traces an expressive line of flight out of the incestuous family enclosure. It draws an enactive cartography, intensely excessive in its movement, that breaks out of the natural habitat of the Oedipal individual, to regain the wide open nature of transindividuality: “Everything takes on a collective value. . . . Everything is political” (Deleuze and Guattari 1986, 17). It is in the name of a “people to come” that one becomes-animal (1986, 18).
