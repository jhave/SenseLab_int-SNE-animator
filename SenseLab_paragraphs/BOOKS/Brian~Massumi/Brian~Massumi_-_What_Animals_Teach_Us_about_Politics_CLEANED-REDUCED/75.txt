For Bergson, instinct can only be thought in relation to intuition. He defines instinct as intuition that is “lived rather than represented” (1998, 175). Lived intuition. An intuition that is represented rather than lived would be a cognition, occurring on a very different reflexive level of life on which thinking is not flush with doing, and the words or images representing it are capable of shaking off the conditional mode of the performative in order to effectively pass as denoting what they denote. This is also a thinking that surpasses the given, to come to new conclusions, but one that contrives to remain in referential mode. Lived and/or represented, intuition belongs to the active field of consciousness (consciousness is just that, a “field” of activity, not a thing; Bergson 1998, 178). “Instinct,” in that it belongs to the field of consciousness, is “not situated beyond the limits of the mind” (1998, 175). There is a flash of mentality to it. Instinct is a mode of thinking, one with doing. Being directly lived, gestured rather than represented, its mentality is of a degree that is by nature resistant to cognitive definition. There is always something extra about it that enthusiastically eludes cognitive referencing. It is always thinking-doing in excess over denotation.
