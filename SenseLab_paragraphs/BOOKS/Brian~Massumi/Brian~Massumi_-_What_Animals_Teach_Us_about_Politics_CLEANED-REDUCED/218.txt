of expression of the movement of becoming leading to the reinvention of the content of life. What it will bring, once it has run its course, will have been the expressed of the situation through which its movement of invention swept. After the fact, this expressed will be fully and finally recognized and authorized as the “what” it had been about in that situation. Retroactively, it will become the conventionally recognized content of that situation, signed and sentimentally sealed. It will end its run. But: its end will be what is given to the next pulse of the process, which will trigger itself into activity in an inherited dependence on this newly minted already expressed: a newly minted lived importance. Grist for another run of supernormal tendency, by dint of lived abstraction. And so the affective cycle of life goes, spiraling ever -esquely around the center of gravity of corporeality and thematic content.
