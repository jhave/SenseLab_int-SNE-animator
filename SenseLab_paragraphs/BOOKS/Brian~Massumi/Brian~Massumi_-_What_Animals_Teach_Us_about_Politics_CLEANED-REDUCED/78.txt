Bergson proposes a concept designed to replace the notion of cognition, so woefully misplaced with respect to instinct as lived intuition. Instinct, Bergson says, is not cognitive. It is sympathetic. And he couldn’t say it any more clearly: “instinct is sympathy” (Bergson 1998, 176; emphasis added). “We call intuition here the sympathy by which one is transported into the interior of an object in order to coincide with what there is unique and consequently inexpressible in it” (2007, 135). For the purposes of the present project, it is necessary to add a corrective to this definition, as well as to propose an extension of it. The corrective concerns the word “object.” If thought instinctively distinguishes not ready-made objects but rather integrally interlinked experiential qualities, with an eye to their potential supernormal becoming, it would be more precise to say that sympathy “transports us into the heart of the event.” A fuller formulation would be “we call instinct, in its aspect of lived intuition, the sympathy that transports us, with a gesture effecting a transformation-in-place, into the heart of a unique event that is just beginning, with which our life will now coincide, but whose outcome is as yet unknowable, and consequently inexpressible, laced as the movement toward it is with supernormal tendency.”
