In play, the generic outcome is: inventively express enthusiasm of the body. In combat, it is: fight or flee, win or lose. In predation: eat or be eaten. Although the parameters are generally given and are intuitively understood from the very first gesture, the end is never entirely a foregone conclusion, and this also is immediately understood from the first gestural flush of activity triggering the event. The open-endedness goes beyond the uncertainty as to which generic alternate ending will eventuate. There is always also the creative possibility that a spontaneous improvisation—an enactive aesthetic invention—will inflect the tendential unfolding, giving the genericness of the theme a singular twist, a something extra surpassing the known “what” of the goings-on with an unforeseen “how” it will have happened. The sympathetic “understanding” of the tendential orientation of the theme, including an intuitive understanding of the manner in which its generic givenness could be surpassed in the coming event, comes with the immediacy of “primary consciousness.”
