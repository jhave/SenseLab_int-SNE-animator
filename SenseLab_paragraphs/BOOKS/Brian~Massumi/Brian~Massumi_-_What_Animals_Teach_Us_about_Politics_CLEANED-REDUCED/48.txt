Spontaneity does have a logic, even in its refusal to abide by the law. It follows the constitutively open logic of relational intensification, in the direction of the emergence of new forms. Parallel to mutation, there is another factor for the origination of variation: a power of experiential artifice no less immanent to the nature of instinct than instinct is immanent to nature. In the face of the accident, instinct is apt to fold back upon its own self-driving, its own self-varying propulsivity.21 Faced with a change in the environment exerting a selective pressure, it returns to its own margin of maneuver, carried forward in its performative gestures. To the conformity demanded by the selective pressures of adaptation, it opposes an immanent power of supernormal invention. Instinctive action plays its own natural creativity against the limitative conditions of the external milieu. Whether an instinctive action is induced by an external stimulus or a situation of external necessity or happens in the absence of either, there is a degree of “hallucinatory” freedom in the deformational variations it performs. Instinct, Bergson emphasizes, is not just triggered, it is played (1998, 145, 180).22 It plays itself, as it plays upon. It is always the playing out of a true act, never just a stereotype of action. The inherent supernormal element of the instinctual dynamism makes the difference between acting and playacting a naturally minimal one.
