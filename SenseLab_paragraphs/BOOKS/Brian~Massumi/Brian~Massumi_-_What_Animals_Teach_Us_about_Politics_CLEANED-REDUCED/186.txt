“The” spectacle is not monolithic. To use a phrase of Ruyer’s, it is a “spectacle-spectator complex” (Ruyer 1958, 203–221). The spectatorial relation is a distributed field of activity. It is saturated throughout by the reciprocity of relating. When the monkeys were playing before the observing anthropologist, the anthropologist was actively implicated with them in the ludic complex their gestures occasioned, in a transformation-in-place sweeping both sides up, in a way not entirely foreign to the kind of doubly deterritorializing pure becoming discussed in Supplement 1. When the projection-happy crowd waits in line for the opportunity to indulge in some sentimental projection upon the latest newborn panda celebrities, the observed animals enter immediately into a complex field of relation with the human multitude, across the bars. There are becomings afoot and a-paw, if only just stirringly and all but imperceptible.
