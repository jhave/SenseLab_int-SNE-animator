A simple visit to the zoo is a minor instantiation of this too-human structure: a furred, feathered, and scaly morality tale repeating a zooological variation on the story of human politics. The neurotic rigidity of the zoe-animal/bios-human separation is not enough to prevent a zone of indifference from forming. The zoo in fact actively favors its formation, through its interpretive and public relations activities. It is a constant of these activities to humanize the animals. They are known by their names, chosen with due attention to the cuteness factor. Their romances and the resulting births, no less than their lamented deaths, provide regular news filler. Everything possible is done to incite the human public to identify with the animals in the zoo, the better to raise funds. An identificatory confusion is overlaid upon the category separation inherent to the institution of the zoo. We know which side of the bars we’re on. But still, don’t we feel for the animals’ joys and travails? Don’t we vicariously share in their victories and defeats? The zoo is not simply a place of confinement. It is also a slush gate of melodrama that endows with bios beings consigned to categorical definition to zoe. The fuzzy outlines of this emotional mutual inclusion does not replace the hard-edged exclusion constitutive of human politics. It adds itself to it, in parallel on another level, or like a palimpsest; or again, like a decorative overlay applied to the hard wall of human sovereignty like a layer of wallpaper. In this case, we are actively encouraged to confuse the painted figure for the wallpaper. How can we not, when the wallpaper of identification papers over the weight-bearing frame of the zoe/bios distinction?
