as a sideshow: captured by the already-given arena of activity of the circus. But you can never catch a whale whiter than the page it is written on. The expression of animality is most superlatively natural the more integrally natural functions and contexts are placed in suspense. In suspense, they are felt with an enthusiasm of the body so far reaching as to stretch the length of the animal continuum, and so envelopingly ubiquitous as to lurk in every in-between, so prowlingly as to inhabit all the gaps between what is and what could be (but never will be, outside of expression).
To the extent that this movement of animal expression frustrates any adaptive reterritorialization as its destination, it runs against the normal grain of the animality, whose natural direction so often includes corporeal recapture, as part of the natural life cycle of life’s variation. The human’s renewing of ties with its instinctive animal core is an “unnatural participation” (participation contre nature) (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 240, 258, 260). It is a counterparticipation in intensest nature, carried to the highest degree of lived abstraction, suspended in the artifice of writing. In this mode of lived abstraction, the human is not conscious “of ” the animal. The writing is not discoursing “about” the animal. The human is doing the animal in thinking-writing gesture: in-acting a pure animal expression, in a mutual envelopment of one and the other, and the neither-one-nor-theother of their zone of indiscernibility in becoming.
