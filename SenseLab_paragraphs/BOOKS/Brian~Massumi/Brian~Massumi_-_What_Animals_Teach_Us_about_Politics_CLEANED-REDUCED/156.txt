One writes always for animals . . .“unnatural participation,” symbiosis, involution. Only the animal in man is addressed. This does not mean writing about one’s dog, one’s cat. . . . It does not mean making animals speak. It means writing as a rat draws a line or flicks its tail, as a bird casts a sound, as a feline slinks or sinks in sleep. (Deleuze and Parnet 1987, 75; trans. modified)
