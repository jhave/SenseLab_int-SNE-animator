Cure: the word is still too compromised by the pathological paradigm. Better words: reanimation, reinvigoration. It is all about reanimating life. Every reinvigoration takes the route of a lived cartography of transindividual nature, ludically tensored toward the supernormal. Ludic reinvigoration is expressive. It is inventive. In its transindividuality, it is ethical. In its -esqueness, it is aesthetic. In all its aspects, it is affective. What it is not is analytic, either in the psychoanalytic or formal senses. Neither is it critical, in the denunciatory sense.
