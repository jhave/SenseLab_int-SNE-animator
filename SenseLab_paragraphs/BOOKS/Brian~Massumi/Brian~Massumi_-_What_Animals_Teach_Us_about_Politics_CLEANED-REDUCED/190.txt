What is felt in sympathy is the dynamic form of the situation. This is felt not from the point of view of one participant or the other, but from the situational perspective of what, potentially, passes between them. Sympathy is not identificatory, and it in no way involves an undifferentiation. It moves experience with an enactive understanding of the differential between the respective roles to be played out reciprocally between the participants: what Ruyer calls the “formative theme” of the situation (Ruyer 1958, 17– 18).8 The formative theme is what was earlier called the “commanding form.” To return to the main example used in the body of this essay, combat is the formative theme of both fighting and play-fighting, the difference being in the relative weighting of the creative factor of surplus-value of life that comes with enthusiasm of the body, relative to the survival value that comes with corporeal striving in the face of the given imperatives of the situation (or, between the intensity of lived abstraction and the compellingness of lived importance).
