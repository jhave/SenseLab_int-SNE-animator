The difference between the human and the animal in this connection is perhaps that humans experience paradoxes of mutual inclusion as a breakdown of their capacity to think, and are agitated by it (Russell certainly was, and never quite got over it). The animal, however, is less agitated than it is activated by them. The animal in play actively, effectively affirms paradox. This augments its capacities in at least two ways. On the one hand, animals learn through play (to the extent that a play fight is preparation for the real combat engagements that may be necessary in the future). On the other hand, the purview of its mental powers expands. In play, the animal elevates itself to the metacommunicational level, where it gains the capacity to mobilize the possible. Its powers of abstraction rise a notch. Its powers of thought are augmented. Its life capacities more fully deploy, if abstractly. Its forces of vitality are intensified accordingly. The ludic gesture is a vital gesture.
