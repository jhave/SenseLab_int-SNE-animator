Note: The purpose of the warning is to signal a divergence between the speculative pragmatism developed here and, on the one hand, pragmatic philosophies for which function and utility are primary and, on the other hand, speculative realism and object-oriented ontology. As a substancebased ontology, ooo, as developed by Graham Harman (2005), is fundamentally at odds with process-oriented ontogenetic philosophies whose ultimate notions are activity and event rather than substance, and whose metaphysical task is to think subjectivities-without-a-subject rather than the object without the subject. Quentin Meillassouxâ€™s influential version of speculative realism sternly applies the law of the excluded middle, or the law of noncontradiction, and deals with the aporias associated with it by appealing not to the positivity of mutual inclusion but to contingency, understood not creatively but negatively, as the ultimate impossibility of applying the law of the excluded middle in a way that effectively excludes uncertainty (Meillassoux 2008). Speculative pragmatism, on the other hand, passionately embraces uncertainty, with all the productive powers of effective paradox.
