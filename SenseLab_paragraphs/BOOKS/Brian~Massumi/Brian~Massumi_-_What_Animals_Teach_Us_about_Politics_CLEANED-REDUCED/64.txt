The vitality affect expressing enthusiasm of the body establishes a transindividual link.25 The transformation-in-place accompanying the onset of play does not strike one without taking the other as well. When it strikes one, it hits two (at least two). The transindividuality of this transformation is what makes play a fundamentally relational process, from the moment its movement triggers. Its relationality potentially extends into a transsituational link. In the movement of play, existential territories enactively intersect and mutually modulate, across their difference, swept in the direction of novel expressions of their dynamic forms, each new playmove having the value of a fight-move in improvisational potential. Play becomes combatesquely, as combat becomes ludically. It is a question of a reciprocal deterritorialization, each arena stretched differentially into the other. This double deterritorialization is the very movement of lived abstraction, mobilizing itself toward invention. It reinforces and extends the cardinal gap between what a gesture denotes and what it would denote. It is what makes consequential the minimal difference separating what is from what could be that the ludic gesture paradoxically includes in its doing. It is the form of the creative force unleashed by play. It is what ensures the potentializing circuit between the present and the future.
