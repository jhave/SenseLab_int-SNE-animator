What is anamorphically edited out is the fact that there is activity of another nature that continues in spite of the structuring. This activity continues to minimally gap the structure with pressure from a not entirely smothered appetite to overspill it. For however rigid the underlying category separation, and however sentimentally effective its papering over, there remains an uncontained animal residue. Something else is also going on that cannot be reduced either to the mutually exclusive separation between zoe and bios, nor to projective identificationâ€™s compensatory zone of undifferentiation, nor even to the sociopathy of their zoo-ological cofunctioning. Something is still stirring imperceptibly beneath the surface of the sentimental theater of human emotions, and percolating through the structure it distortedly backgrounds.
