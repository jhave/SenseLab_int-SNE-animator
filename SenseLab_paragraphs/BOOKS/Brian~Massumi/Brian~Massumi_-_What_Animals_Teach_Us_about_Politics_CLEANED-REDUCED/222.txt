What specific strategies might animal politics pursue as regards the all-too-human politics of the zoo? Should the denunciatory gesture be favored as an exception in this case, in the face of the structural cynicism of the zoo, the stifling of the vitality of its inmates, and its papering over of its own barbarity? Is the zooâ€™s new vocation as an ark for endangered animals sufficient to redeem it? Were the zoo to be abolished, would the remaining, screen-based, experiences of animals to which most children would then be confined carry as intense an apprenticeship in escape from the human by the human?
The answers to these questions deserve in-depth playing out that is beyond the scope of this essay, indeed beyond the scope of writing. It is not in pure expression that the kind of movement can be carried forward in a way that can metamodel the surpassing of the zoo-ological structure in an actual reinvention of the lived importance of animal-human relations. In an arena so thick with corporeality and affective complexity, a diversity of exploratory thinking-doings and experimental dramatizations, across many an arena of expressive activity, must come to reciprocal expression. Only an enactive ecology of a diversity of animal practices, in a creative tension of differential mutual inclusion, can begin to do the trick. What the pure written-becoming-animal of philosophy, as attempted in this essay, can do is to play at prying open the minimal difference that is the abstractly lived condition of emergence of the movement of surpassing the given, helping leverage potentially in-forming, ethico-aesthetic surplus-value of life.
