It embraces uncertainty, but takes no interest in absolute contingency, on the processual grounds that wherever thought can penetrate there has always already been a taking-determinate form, so that the world is littered with the leavings of past emergences. For this reason, contingency is never absolute, because what unfolds from it has to pick a path through the leavings, which constrain its course. In Whitehead’s terms, the unfolding of contingency is always relative to the “settled world.” Even quantum contingency in physics is either captured into higher-level physical processes that are not purely contingent (the structure and periodicities of the atom, for starters) or perishes no sooner than it arises, leaving no effect and thus having no effective existence (virtual particles in the quantum void). Anywhere other than at the ineffective vanishing point of existence, absolute contingency is a purely formal creature of logic (as is contradiction, for different reasons pertaining to the speciousness of the negative; for Bergson’s classic critique of the negative, see Bergson 1998, 272–298). Contingency as it occurs in the world is in the constitutive gaps factoring into all emergences and, again, in the gaps between settlements (captures). Contingency as it pertains to emergence and insubordination to capture must be thought positively in terms of spontaneity, not negativized as accidental (the mere lack of a sufficient cause) or assimilated to the merely logically uncertain.
