Bare activity is a conceptual antidote to Agamben’s “bare life,” with its reliance on the zoe/bios distinction and its foundational concern with the setting of the boundary between inside and outside (if only to suspend it in the dialectic-without-synthesis of exclusive inclusion; see n. 60 and nn. 2, 5 to Supplement 2 for more on Agamben). Bare activity, for its part, construes the inside and outside as phasings in and out of each other: as phase shifts designating poles in the same process of mutual inclusion. The transindividual folds into the infraindividual, which folds back out into the transindividual.4 The more-than human is not outside. Rather, the human—where it occurs to itself in nature—is in the middle, transected by movements which surpass it. Its existence is membranous and, like all membranes, precarious.
