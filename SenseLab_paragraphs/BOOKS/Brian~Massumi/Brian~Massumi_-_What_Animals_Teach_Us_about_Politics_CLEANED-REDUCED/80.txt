What intuition adds to instinct is the corporeality of the present situation. Corporeality is a component pole of intuition, as defined above: the bodily tension between the lived abstraction of the tendency to surpass the given, and the lived importance of corporeality, with the accent on the former. If instinct were lived without a boost of intuition, it would only be able to improvise supernormally on what it had inherited from the past and, lacking an anchoring in the present, would always be hallucinatory, even with a stimulus. Intuition grounds instinct’s corporeal inheritance from the past in the corporeality of the present, enabling it to effectively grasp the supernormal potential of the situation. It enables instinct to factor in the imperatives of the situation, the more effectively to maneuver its supernormal appetite past them. Intuition adds its own dose of appetitiveness to the mix (if it didn’t have its own appetite for life, why would it bother to get mixed up in events in the first place?). Intuition’s double polarity capacitates instinct to factor into its operation what is presently important, while at the same time maintaining instinct’s appetitive tending to surpass. This effectively increases instinct’s improvisational prowess. It makes it more pragmatically able to grasp the inexpressible, the better to expressively -esque its movement. Each lived instinctive act bears a degree of intuitive enabling. To what degree depends on many factors, including but not limited to an animal’s level of evolutionary complexity.
