The affirmation gestured forth with enthusiasm of the body is at once ethical and political. In its absence, life tends to mire in the pathic tendency to respond corporeally to an irritation or a prodding in the negative, by avoidance or denial.49 When life falls too much under the hammer of pathic necessity, it loses its spring, and the less surplus-value it generates. The more life activity falls under the sway of the pathic tendency, the more it suffers from the corresponding deficit of passion. There is no transcendent foundation for the aesthetico-political preference for surplus-value of life. It’s simply that surrendering one’s life to the travails of the pathic is hardly worth the pain. Anything that springs to life feels that immediately. This is a felt self-evidence that operates as a lived criterion of evaluation immanent to vital experience.
