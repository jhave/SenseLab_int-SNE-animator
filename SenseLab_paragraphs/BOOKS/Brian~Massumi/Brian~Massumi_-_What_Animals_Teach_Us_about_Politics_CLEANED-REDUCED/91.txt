Instinct is sympathy, at every level, in all its forms. The peck of the herring gull chick is already an exercise in sympathy. It traces, in its own dynamic form, the negative outline of the action of the adult that will relay it. The young gull’s passion includes the adult’s, in immanent counterpoint. The same must be said of human language. Even the most solitary human language act, Deleuze and Guattari insist, holds in immanent counterpoint an entire “people to come” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 345–346, 377; 1986, 18). Language, even the most high-level and elaborated, participates in primary consciousness. The tip of the tongue and typing finger dip into it at every waggle. If instinct is sympathy, then language is instinctive—no less so than a wolf cub’s gambol or the baby bird’s avid peck.
