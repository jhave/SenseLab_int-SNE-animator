The use of language in this kind of situation is very different. On the one hand, it is procedural in Arakawa and Gins’s sense. It is used to embed certain set of potentials in the situation in an open-ended way that can only be brought to expression collectively. On the other hand, the use of language is necessarily evocative, because what will transpire has not been predetermined, but has to eventuate, and how it eventuates is up for relational grabs, and will only be clear as the event unfolds. This evocativeness of potentials as yet not fully formed gives the procedural language a poetic edge. You can see this poetico-procedural use of language in Arakawa and Gins’s writing. You can read it as poetry, and you can use it as an instructional manual for experiential event-making.
