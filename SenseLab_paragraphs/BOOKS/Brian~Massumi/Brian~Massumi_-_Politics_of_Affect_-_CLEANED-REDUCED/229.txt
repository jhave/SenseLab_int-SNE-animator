The implications of capitalism’s ontopowerful capture of resistance are far-reaching, and far from being clear. It is beyond the limits of this interview to explore them further. I have tried to work out some of the implications in some of my recent work, in particular The Power at the End of the Economy7  and Ontopower. I think new distinctions are necessary, not only among structure, system and process, but also between biopower and ontopower (which for me actually goes even beyond biopower in its becoming-immanent to the field of life – a point of disagreement with Lazzarato), and concerning the relation of state (and state-like) structures to capitalism (for the state is one of the last refuges of supposedly rationalized structure – capitalism hardly bothers to assert its rationality any more, contenting itself with creating the affective ‘fact’ of its inevitability).
