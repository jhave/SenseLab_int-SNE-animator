The definition considers ‘to be affected’ a capacity. The force of a blow, for example, is a product of an impinging force meeting a force of resistance, a certain capacity to resist. That capacity is a mode of activity of the body. It is a doing, as much as the blow itself (it is the body asserting its structural integrity, bracing itself in a certain manner to absorb, deflect, dodge the blow, or even, as in martial arts, to turn its force back against its author). Reciprocally, the fist that delivers the blow does not just affect its target. It is also affected by the force of resistance it encounters. To hit can hurt almost as much as to be hit. But the shared pain corresponds to a distribution of roles. The distribution of roles attaches the mode and degree of activity. The outcome may give one party a certain advantage in a next encounter. The relative standing of the parties involved may change in a way that has lasting effects. If those lasting effects stabilize into an inequality between the parties that conditions subsequent encounters, the structuring of an emergent power structure has occurred.
