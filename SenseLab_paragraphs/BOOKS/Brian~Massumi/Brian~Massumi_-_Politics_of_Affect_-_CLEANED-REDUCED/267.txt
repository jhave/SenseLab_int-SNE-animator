Brian Massumi: I call this new media ecology we’re describing a ‘quasi-public’ sphere. I mean that there is relay and overlap between private and public messaging that blurs the boundaries between them. To  continue with the Facebook example, you friend your friends’ friends, and they friend yours, and soon you’re sharing ‘personal’ news with total strangers. The mode of expression is still ‘personal’, but the presupposition is of a certain degree of publicness, more restricted than broadcast but not exactly intimate or personal in any way previous generations would have understood those words. I find this fascinating because this blurring of the boundaries of the public and the private isn’t just the negative of them. It’s a whole new relational field where the act of expression is already informed and formatted by its quasi-publicness, so that it is marked from within by the presence of others. It’s an example of expression becoming explicitly what Deleuze and Guattari called a ‘collective assemblage of enunciation’. To the  extent that we produce ourselves through social media – in pretty much the same sense as when we refer to what film producers do – we are fairly explicitly participating in a collective individuation under the flimsy guise of the ‘personal’.
