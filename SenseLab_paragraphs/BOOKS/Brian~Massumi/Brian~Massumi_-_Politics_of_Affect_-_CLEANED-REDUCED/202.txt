A blow is what it does. What it does is trigger the eventful resolution of a differential of forces at a point of encounter. The Spinozist definition hinges affect on encounter. It is thoroughly eventful, it derives structure from event. The two sides between which the encounter passes cannot simply be characterized as passive or active. The affective event does not presuppose a passivity on one side and an activity on the other. It involves a differential of modes and degrees of activity that is eventfully resolved, to structuring effect. This is very much in keeping with Michel Foucault’s definition of power as a complex differential of forces, where the power to affect is strictly coincident with the power to resist, and where power effects accumulate. This places power structures and their corresponding roles on the level of effect, or of what comes to be eventfully determined. Power can no longer be construed as resting on an ideological ground that is predetermining. So the first step towards mobilizing a theory of affect for resistance is to understand that there is a first degree of resistance in any encounter that it is not simply passive, but already expresses a capacity, and that it is these encounters that are determining. There is no ideology as determining, in the first or last instance. Power structures are secondary effects of affective encounters, and ideologies are secondary expressions of power structures. Ideology is on the side of effects – twice over. It is not fundamentally on the side of causes. What it is certainly not is a sufficient cause.
