On the other hand, it might well catapult you directly into action. In either case the first making of the moment, the inauguration of the event, is that absolute coincidence between the past and the dawning present. Not a subject thinking or being towards the world, but the world reconstituting itself around an actively present germ of the past. There’s already, in that immeasurable instant of incipience, an activation of tendencies towards the future. The future has a kind of felt presence, an affective presence, as an attractor. Because each tendency tends towards a certain kind of outcome. It is attracted by its own end. That end point is what James calls a ‘terminus’. It’s a limit point governing the direction of an unfolding. Again, that’s like a thought, if you can consider thinking an effective presence of what isn’t actually there. By being effectively present without actually being there I don’t mean being consciously projected on the future as a possibility. It’s a pulling of the present, already pregnant with pastness, out of itself, from within its own event. It’s a force of time acting immanently to the occurrence. It’s a real, generative factor of the forming moment. I call it a force because it has a certain kind of efficacy, a formative power. I like to call this formative participation of the future ‘quasicausal’, because it is more like an attractor in chaos theory than an efficient material cause. Whitehead insists that the future is also always active in the ‘energizing’ of the present by the past that inaugurates a coming event.
