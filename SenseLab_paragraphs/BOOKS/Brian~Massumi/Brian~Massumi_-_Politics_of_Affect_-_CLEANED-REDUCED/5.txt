The immediately political dimension is also  built into the base definition of affect informing process approaches like the one enacted through these interviews. This definition, deceptively simple, was formulated by Spinoza: affect is the power ‘to affect and be affected’. This definition recurs throughout the  book like a refrain. Each time it occurs, it calls forth helper concepts, in  increasing variety.  These also  recur, and together they begin to weave a conceptual web for thinking through affect. The formula ‘to affect and be affected’ is also proto-political in the sense that it includes relation in the definition. To affect and to be affected is to be open to the world, to be active in it and to be patient for its return activity. This openness is also taken as primary. It is the cutting edge of change. It is through it that things-in-the-making cut their transformational teeth. One always affects and is affected in encounters; which is to say, through events. To begin affectively in change is to begin in relation, and to begin in relation is to begin in the event.
