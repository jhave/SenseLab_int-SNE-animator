Overall  it’s  modulated  by  the  feeling  of threat that comes with the sense of emergency, and by the securitization procedures that have been set in place in response. But securitization assumes instability. Security is not the opposite of insecurity. It’s wed to it. In his book on trust and power, Niklas Luhmann is clear about that.4  To produce security with any regularity, he says, you have to produce the insecurity it’s predicated on. Foucault makes the same point. Security measures have to be taken pre-emptively, because we’re always caught in the first flush of something happening under complex emergency conditions, before it can be known where it will go and what it will become. Security measures have to bootstrap order back out of quasi-chaos.
I’ve argued that this qualifies them as procedures of becoming, or what I call ‘ontopower’.
