As announced in the preface, the aim of this book has not been to prescribe solutions but to pose better problems. A ‘better’ problem is one that provides a jumpingoff point for others to continue from in their own way, along their own exploratory paths, for intensities of experience to come. A ‘good’ problem is one that wears its inconclusiveness like a badge of merit: a token of its problematic service of inviting and inciting. It is one that twists itself around its own loose ends to tie itself into an alluring knot, like a ribbon around a gift of process. The gifts of process I have received from the authors and interlocutors whose thinking infuses the preceding interviews have been more than alluring. They have been tools of life, and resources for survival. It is hoped that this book has been able to pay the favour forward, in however small a way.
