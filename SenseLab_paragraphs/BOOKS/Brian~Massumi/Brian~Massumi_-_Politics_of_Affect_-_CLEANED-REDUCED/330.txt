Every instinctive action performed by animals – and what action could be  said not to have  an instinctive basis? – has to have both of these elements, the mental and the physical. It has to work them together, otherwise the animal’s actions will be completely maladaptive. If an instinct were incapable of creating variations on its own theme, of inventing new flourishes, new forms for its own operation, then it could  do  little more than respond to the environment in a stereotyped way. This would be fine if the environment did not change. But the environment is always changing. So the animal’s instinctive activity has to wrap itself around changes in the environment. It has to change apace with the changes. That could be defined as a first degree of creative mentality, occurring at the level of a body as a pre-reflexive operation, prior to and independent of selfreflective consciousness.
