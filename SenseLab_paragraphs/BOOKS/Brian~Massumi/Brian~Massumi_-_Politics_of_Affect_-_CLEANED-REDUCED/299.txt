the habit of how we believe we can control it! The habit of entering into a process brings with it the promise that a process engaging with the same conditions twice can generate an event that looks like the event that it generated the first time. But what Brian is saying is that if you take this process seriously, and attend to how it evolves in each of its phases, you will find that no event can be mapped in advance. The event takes us with it and the outcome is always experienced in retrospect: ah! that’s what it was! But instead of saying ‘that’s what it was!’ we have the habit of taking the past and imposing it on the future, quietly exclaiming ‘that’s what it will be!’ Immediation tries to challenge that habit.
