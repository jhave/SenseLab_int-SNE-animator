Marx does not just say that the capitalist identifies with the capitalist structure of society, and that the worker becomes affectively invested in it. He says that the capitalist personifies the capitalist relation’s power to produce, and to appropriate productive forces ever more extensively, and ever more intensely. The worker personifies the potential for the capitalist relation to continue to appropriate productive forces as it proliferates and intensifies its operations – but also the potential that its operation hit a wall (of fatigue, of sabotage, of resistance). In other words, worker and capitalist are figures of capital. They index its constitutive tensions and tendencies. They are products of its process that figure the relational dynamic of its operations. These processual figures can then be fed back into the process to generate second-order effects (effects of processual self-reference).
