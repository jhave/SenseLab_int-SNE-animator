That’s a lot more compelling than coming to ‘correct’ conclusions or assessing outcomes, although it can also bring results. It might force you to find a margin, a manoeuvre you didn’t know you had, and couldn’t have just thought your way into. It can change you, expand you. That’s what being alive is all about.
