In this enactive immediacy, resistance is of the nature of a gesture. Resistance cannot be communicated or inculcated. It can only be gestured. The gesture is a call to attunement. It is an invitation to mutual inclusion in a collective movement. The only power it has is exemplary. It cannot impose itself. It can only catch on. Its power is to throw out the lure of its own amplification. Its power is of contagion. The gesture of resistance is a micro-gesture of offered contagion, oriented otherwise than towards the structures into which the gestures of microfascism occurring on the same level, in the same field, have the tendency to channel. All of this is very consistent with Gabriel Tarde’s micro-sociology of ‘imitation’. But it also reinforces the notion that there is an aesthetic dimension – of allure, of style of gesture – that is not an added dimension but is absolutely integral to the very operation of resistance, one with its politicality.
