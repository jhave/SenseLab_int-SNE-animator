Affect’s social expression is in mass psychology. Mass psychology only understands the collective as a molar aggregate of individualities that have melted into an undifferentiated magma. This is understood to occur when the mediation of socializing mechanisms fails. This idea presupposes a notion of the individual body as the seat of biological impulses that are fundamentally irrational in nature, and must be curbed by culture, or sublimated. Affect calls this entire complex of ideas into question. As pure sociality, affect is by nature transindividual. ‘Transindividual’, however, is not synonymous with ‘collective’ in the mass psychology sense. To the contrary, it expresses itself in movements of correlated differentiation. In itself, it is hyper-differentiated: mutually including  all  manner of differentiations in potential. Finally, affect is not psychological. As transindividual, directly relational and immediately eventful, it overspills on all sides the interiority of the psychological subject. Psychology is a particular mode of expression of affect that individualizes it. Mass psychology is a logical consequence of this individualization: once an individual interiority is constructed, its affective overspilling of its assigned boundaries can only be understood as a de-differentiating melding. The excess of potential that immediates affect, that makes it the force of the social taking form, is mistaken for a magmatic lack of form.
