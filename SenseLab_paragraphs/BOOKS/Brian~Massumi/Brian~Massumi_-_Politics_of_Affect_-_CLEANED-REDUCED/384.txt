And from the complexity of the feedback between nonconscious and conscious dimensions of experience, new tendencies arise. These constitute enactive speculations on the future potential of activity. Affect theory does not reduce the mind to the body in the narrow, physical sense. It asserts that bodies think as they feel, on a level with their movements. This takes thinking out of the interiority of a psychological subject and puts it directly in the world: in the co-motion of relational encounter. If the Humean definition of the mental is accepted – as that which exceeds the given – then every bodily event is flush with mentality. Every act has a degree of mentality proportionate to its capacity to surprise. That capacity varies across the nature–culture continuum, but is never entirely absent, even in the supposedly mechanical workings of ‘dumb’ matter (as deterministic chaos theory has amply demonstrated). Affect requires a far-reaching re-evaluation of what a body can do. What is normally called the ‘mind’ is a reduction of the body’s capacities to the sphere of reflective consciousness (which, as neuropsychology has amply demonstrated, is always accompanied by incipient, sub-threshold actions ‘mirroring’ what is being thought; this was known in process philosophy and affect theory long before the discovery of mirror neurons, under such names as ‘re-enaction’, ‘incipient action’ and ‘reactivation’). Concepts like ‘thinkingfeeling’, ‘non-sensuous perception’, ‘nonconscious experience’ and ‘bare activity’ are designed to deal with the complexity of the body in this processually extended sense. They are ways of articulating how the body always includes the abstract (that which exceeds the given) in its own self-extending definition. Far from suggesting a physicalist reductionism, affect asserts that there is an expansive mental aspect, or what Whitehead calls a ‘mental pole’, to every bodily event.
