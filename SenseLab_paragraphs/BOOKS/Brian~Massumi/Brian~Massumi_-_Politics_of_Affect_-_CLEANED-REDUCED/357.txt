You are constrained in the sense that the active potentials enveloped in the relational milieu are conditioned by the situation. But there are always degrees of freedom – precisely because what presents itself is a landscape of alternative potentials, and not a fait accompli. It’s not over until it’s over. There are any number of things that could happen, by your own actions, or the bull’s, or by chance, that might modulate the field’s complexion of potential, altering its presuppositions on the fly. Even a slight gesture, a most nuanced movement on your part, could change the posture of the bull towards you. You could do a number of things, but you don’t have the time to step aside and consider the situation. You act the decision. Your enacting acts as a decision.
