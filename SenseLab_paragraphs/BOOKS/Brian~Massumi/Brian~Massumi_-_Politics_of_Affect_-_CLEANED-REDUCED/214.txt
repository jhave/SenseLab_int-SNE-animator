Brian Massumi: Affect, for me, is not a matter of faith. I would worry about any interpretation of the concept in those terms. Faith in affect would be as misguided as faith in supposedly disinterested reason. For me, the question is two-fold. On the one hand, it is purely pragmatic; on the other, it is in a certain way aesthetic. Pragmatically, the question concerns powers of existence – powers to act, think and feel. Can strategies privileging an affective approach to events increase our powers of existence? Can they help us act differently, think more actively and feel more thinkingly? If the answer is yes – and I think it is – then they are intensifiers of existence, and produce what I just called a surplus-value of life. A surplus-value of life is a surplusvalue of experience: an enactively lived and immediately felt qualitative difference expressing a heightening of capacities. It is a felt excess of potential, over and above any particular state of being. That could stand quite well as a definition of aesthetic value. Affective approaches embody a pragmatist aesthetics of life’s living.
