One of the things I have been thinking about in relation  to  this  is  how  speciations  converge  not  through a matrix of identity (‘the’ animal, ‘the’ human), but through speeds and slownesses of welling co-constitutive ecologies. Thinking this way perhaps allows us to consider how fields of resonance, or what Simondon calls ‘associated milieus’, emerge not through identity structures (the human, the self) but through ecologies that are as much rhythms as ‘beings’ – different scales and intensities of time. This may in turn enable us to get beyond identity politics (as it continues to exist even within politics of affect) and explore the immanent coexistence of a relational third – what I have elsewhere called the interval. When the interval becomes an active part of what the event-constellation can do, we find ourselves in a ‘radical empiricism’ without a preconditioned sense of what the terms of the relation consist of. This, I think, is what we try to do with the SenseLab events and with our inquiries into new forms of collaboration. We ask: what does this third do? How does it speciate? What does it co-create? What kind of ecology is it?
