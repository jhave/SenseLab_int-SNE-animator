is a correlated becoming through which individuals receive a boost of extra-being from their participation in an event that surpasses them as individuals. For that, the concept of affect is much more fundamental than the concept of interest. The differentials, tensions and tendencies that go into making a collective individuation are capacities to affect and to be affected, which co-compose to form complex fields of reciprocal capacitation. Thinking affectively means thinking in terms of ecologies of potential and the events that express and vary them.
This changes the meaning of the word ‘care’. What you’re really caring for is not your separate self, or other individuals. You are caring for both through a care for the event, in the way that Erin Manning talks about it in her work. Care for the event is care for the relational field as such – care for what can come of the events brewing in the field in terms of what I talked about earlier as a supernormal intensification culminating in the creation of a qualitative surplus-value of life for all involved. Surplus-value of life is not given and it is not found. It is created. This creative aspect gives an aesthetic dimension to the political thinking of the care for the event. It also implies that there are techniques for modulating fields of relation – techniques of relation that have to be thought and practised differently from techniques of individual expression, or group techniques of the kind we normally refer to when we think of the political, such as debate and negotiation. The dominant techniques for political expression and negotiation of interests are techniques of interaction. Interaction, as I argued in Semblance and Event, is very different from  relation.  It  is  inter-individual,  as  opposed  to transindividual, and communicational as opposed to ontogenetic. We need to hone our techniques of relation, and create cultures at the intersection of politics and aesthetics that foster them.
