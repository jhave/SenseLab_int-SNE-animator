Much of the work of the book is dedicated to laying the polyvalent groundwork for this reforging of concepts, transversal to their usual diametric opposition with each other. Such fellow-travelling concepts as ‘differential affective attunement’, ‘collective individuation’, ‘micropolitics’, ‘thinking-feeling’, ‘bare activity’, ‘ontopower’  and  ‘immanent  critique’  relay  the  base definition of affect with which the first interview begins. Once  they  introduce  themselves,  they  wend  their way through subsequent interviews, taking on greater conceptual consistency, complexifying the concept of affect as they go. This is what a process-oriented exploration does: complexify its conceptual web as it advances. It tries not to reduce. It tries not to encapsulate. It does not end in an overview. Rather, it works to become more and more adequate to the ongoing complexity of life. This means that it does not arrive at any final answers. It does not even seek solutions. It seeks to re-pose the problems life poses itself, always under transformation. The goal is to arrive at a transformational matrix of concepts apt to continue the open-ended voyage of thinking-feeling life’s processual qualities, foregrounding their proto-political dimension and the paths by which it comes to full expression in politics (taking the word in the plural).
