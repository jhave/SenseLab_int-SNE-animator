Take something as simple as a line of movement. It makes no sense to take it as a sequence of points, because that abstracts the movement out of it. As Bergson said, all you get is a set of points, and points are fixed. The movement is not a sequence of points. It’s a folding of the immediate past into the present, as the present is turning over into the future, in a way that qualitatively changes a situation. The past and the future are necessary factors in the constitution of a trajectory of movement. But they are not actual, they’re alreadys and not yets. So when something is in movement, it’s exceeding itself dynamically, it is overspilling its actuality. It is more-than-present at each successive point. We understand that intuitively, we perceive it directly, without having to think about it. If you think of a political situation  and the kind  of collective differential attunement I was talking about – for example a disaster hitting that you have no way of knowing the exact nature or extent of yet – there’s a large number of potential trajectories in play. The onset of the event crystallizes a field of potential movement. Think of it as a pragmatic field, made up of co-present vectors or potential trajectories that are immediately felt, intuitively understood, in an intensely embodied way, that call everyone to attention and energize us towards action
– but are not yet actualized, that are more-than-present in their potential. That felt potential is the jumping-off point, it’s in the very first flush of what’s coming, so it can be treated as a presupposition of the event’s unfolding. The potential is pragmatically presupposed.
