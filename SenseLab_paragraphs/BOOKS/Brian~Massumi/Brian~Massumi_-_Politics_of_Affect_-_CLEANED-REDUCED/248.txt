Brian Massumi: Yes, there is a nonlinear temporality to it. I refer to Deleuze’s time-image in Semblance and Event, but it’s not exactly the same concerns that I’m trying to explore in that book. I use the term ‘semblance’ to develop the idea that there are dimensions of an event that are not actually present but are necessary factors for its constitution.
