Mary Zournazi: In a way, this conversation makes me think about the relation of ‘autonomy and connection’ that you’ve written about. There are many ways of understanding autonomy, but I think with capitalism’s changing face it is harder and harder to be autonomous. For instance, people who are unemployed have very intense reactions and feelings to that categorization of themselves as unemployed. And, in my experience, I’m continually hounded by bureaucratic procedures that tend to restrict my autonomy and freedom – such as constant checks, meetings and forms to fill out. These procedures mark every step you take . . . So to find some way to affirm unemployment that allows you to create another life, or even to get a job, is increasingly more difficult and produces new forms of alienation and ‘disconnection’ . . .
