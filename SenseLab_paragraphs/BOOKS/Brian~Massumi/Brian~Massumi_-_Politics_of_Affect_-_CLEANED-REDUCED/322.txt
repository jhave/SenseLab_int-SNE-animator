Erin Manning: Deleuze takes up the concept of necessity from Nietzsche. Nietzsche places the question of necessity in the event’s asking – this comes across very clearly in the passage in Thus Spoke Zarathustra called ‘Moment’ – ‘what is the mode of existence created in the necessity of this particular decision?’ What he means by decision in this context is also a kind of Whiteheadian notion of decision, understood as the cut propelling the continuing of a process, similar to the concept of transduction in Simondon. It is not individual will. It isn’t about my going into this way of living because I judge it necessary for me but rather, as you said, how the event constructs its own forms of necessity. This means that at many stages in our practices and processes we are faced with having to re-conceive how we might encounter necessity. Sometimes the necessity is really frustrating. It doesn’t appear as we wished or imagined it would appear. This kind of approach to necessity demands an incredible flexibility and real rigour in the techniques and enabling constraints put into place and what effects they produce. It demands a return to the question of what the stakes are. How are they generated? What kinds of skills are available? How does this particular act co-compose with other acts in the making? All of those questions bear their own processes of necessity. We see our work as composing procedurally and technically with those necessities in a way that produces modes of existence we can live with.
