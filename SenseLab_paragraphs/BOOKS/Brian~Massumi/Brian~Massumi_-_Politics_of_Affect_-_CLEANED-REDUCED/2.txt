The interviews that follow do not purport to present a comprehensive treatment of the field of affect. Neither do they present an introductory encapsulation â€“ although it is hoped that the dialogic format renders the ins and out of affect more immediately accessible than the academic format. They are an invitation to voyage. Their aim is to map a passage for thinking through the intensities of feeling that fill life, and form it, across its ups and downs. Thinking through affect is not just reflecting on it. It is thought taking the plunge, consenting to ride the waves of affect on a crest of words, drenched to the conceptual bone in the fineness of its spray. Affect is only understood as enacted. This book hopes to enact  affect  conceptually  for  the  reader  through  its stream of words.
