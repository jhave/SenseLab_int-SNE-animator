The complexity of this model of affect quickly compounds. There is a second part to the definition. Affect, Spinoza says, is the capacity to affect or be affected, as applied to a transition. Further, the transition is felt, as the passing of a threshold to a higher or lower power of existence, understood as an affective readiness for subsequent encounter. That readiness carries resistance to the extent that it is unsubordinated to the roles unequally assigned by already-established power structures. It is with the notion of affect as involving a felt transition that we move, as you indicated in your question, away from the paradigm of rationality, while preserving thought. In the heat of an encounter, we are immersed in eventful working-out of affective capacities. We have no luxury of a distance from the event from which we can observe and reflect upon it. But in that immediacy of   feeling   absorbed   in   the   encounter,   we   already understand, in the very fibre of our being, what is at stake, and where things might be tending. The feeling of the transitional encounter is not ‘raw’ feeling. It is imbued with an immediate understanding of what is under way, what might be coming – and what we are becoming. This is enactive understanding: it is one with the action. It is what I call a thinking-feeling. Thinkingfeeling corresponds roughly to C.S. Peirce’s category of ‘abduction’, which he considers the most primary of logical categories, lying at the root of the other, betterknown logical modes, of induction and deduction.
