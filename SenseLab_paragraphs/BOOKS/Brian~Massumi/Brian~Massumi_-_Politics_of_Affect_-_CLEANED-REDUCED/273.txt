The question, it seems to me, is always ‘where do we go from here?’ And how can the ‘here’ be tweaked without our thinking that everything begins with  us, with the human, with the personal? How can emerging ecologies attune such that they can produce different affects? How can we conceive of enabling constraints for such an attunement to become part of how eventtime expresses itself? We think a lot about the modulation of effects – how can the event carry the force of uncertainty without breaking into compensatory nodes of self-consciousness? How can the collective recompose without an imposition of a pre-established system for the ordering of the disparate? And of course we fail and fail. But what emerges nonetheless is a strong collective sense, I think, that it is key to move the issue from human centredness to that of speciation, or an ecology of practices. To move from the personal to a sense of event response-ability. With this approach the question of responsibility, the ability to respond, is never before the event. Working collectively from this vantage point asks us not to put ourselves in a pre-planned position of benevolence or generosity or accommodation as though there were an outside of the event. Rather, it pushes us to develop ways of conceiving of eventgenerosity – where it is the event that creates conditions for its own potential openings. Of course this way of operating can be construed as extremely dangerous: we cannot know what the event can do before it is doing it, before it is doing us. The event itself is a free radical in a larger ecology. But we believe this is a risk worth taking since we cannot risk not taking it. The gift is in the giving, with the event as gift-giver, and what resolves from there is always to be determined.
