The logic of mutual inclusion I’ve been talking about is a logic of qualitative difference, taking modes of activity (tendencies) as its object, rather than either objects in the substantialist sense, or subjects in the sense of an agency you could separate out from the event’s occurrence. As Nietzsche said, there is no doer separate from the deed. One of the aims of this logic is to take account of the quantitative, of the plurality of countable elements, but as part of a philosophy of qualitative becoming.
