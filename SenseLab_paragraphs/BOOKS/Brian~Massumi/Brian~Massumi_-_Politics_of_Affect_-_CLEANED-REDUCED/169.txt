A lot of the impetus for what we’re  doing  came from some very intense conversations we had with Isabelle Stengers, who explained that her criteria for a successful intellectual event was precisely that – that it be an event. That something really happens that wouldn’t have happened otherwise. If heaven, according to an old Talking Heads song,  is  where  nothing ever happens, then the conference is surely academic heaven. When was the last time you had a truly new thought at a conference? When was the last time that you saw an opinion changed by an academic discussion or debate? On the art side, the equivalent heavens are the artist’s talk and the standard gallery exhibition. Isabelle also emphasized that it is not a question of ‘freedom’, in the sense of simply lifting constraints. Nothing happens most where there are no constraints, because then anything goes, and anything going is just nothing carried to a higher power, heaven to the nth degree. You might avoid the conference, but where does that get you if you end up with the kind of free-floating, free-associating discussion you might enjoy late at night
