This for me is one of the interesting aspects of the question of what a body can do: ‘Can a body think?’ If you define mentality as Whitehead does – as the capacity to exceed what is given and to bring forth a novelty – then an improvisational variation playing on an instinctive activity, even in an animal without a brain, shows a certain degree or mode of mentality. This conception  of  mentality  breaks  down  the  Cartesian distinction between the mental and the physical, but without simply collapsing them into each other, or bracketing one out. It forces you to rethink how you define the physical and the mental, how you parse them together.
