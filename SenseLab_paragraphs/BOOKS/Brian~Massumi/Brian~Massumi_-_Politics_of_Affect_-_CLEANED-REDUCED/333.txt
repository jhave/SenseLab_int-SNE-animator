What Tinbergen found, even though he didn’t want to acknowledge it, was that at the heart of instinct there is a force of invention. This means that creativity is innate. It is in our nature. You could even say that we are most in touch with our animality, with what is most singular in animal life, when we surpass the given in a creative way. This fundamentally calls into question the tendency of theorists to define animal life in terms of adaptation, as neo-Darwinians do. In fact, it calls all normative thinking into question, suggesting a need to think much more about the supernormal – about what creatively exceeds the typical and refuses to be limited by resemblance to past forms.
As I mentioned earlier, Whitehead defines the conformity   or   conformation   between   past   events   and present events as the physical pole of nature. You have to think in terms of the co-functioning, or co-operation, of two tendencies. On the one hand, you have a tendency of the present to extend into the future in conformity  with  what  happened  in  the  past.  This  is  a tendency towards homeostasis, towards a discharge of intensity or a return to equilibrium. On the other hand, you have an equally strong tendency towards the supernormal,  towards  intensive  deformation  exceeding  the givenness of instinctive schemas and their adaptation to the environment – towards the invention of forms. This is the aspect of activity that Whitehead defines as mental. The important point for me is that you cannot think the two tendencies separately. It is not an alternative. The mental and the physical are not opposites, they are co-operants. They are two dimensions of the same operation. Two poles of activity. Their co-operation is eventful. It comes in episodes.
