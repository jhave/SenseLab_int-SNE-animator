Christoph Brunner: This is a very important point in relation to methods and the question the SenseLab always gets of what its methods are. If you move through a constant revaluation in the immediacy of an event happening, if you try to find ways not to do something about what’s happening but rather to do in the happening, then you have to completely reconsider the way you use language. It also affects the way you inhabit the institutionalized field of academia, with its constraints and the closed systems we as academics have to work with and through while trying to sustain certain kinds of practices and shift and modulate other kinds of practices. Talking about ‘techniques’ and ‘ecologies of practice’ provides one way of undoing the claim for methods and appropriate instruments. Which leads me back to the language we work in, which is never just reducible to its established rules of usage. How can we conceive the language we use as part of our life practices – in the sense of thinking, living and writing in the presence of each other and in the presence of the many solitudes moving through us? What does it actually mean to undo the confined systems that create anxiety all over again? As an example, we could think of the ‘Nonhuman Turn’ conference we all attended last year in Milwaukee. I have never seen an academic event so full of anxiety. Especially among the PhD students, who are expected to do inventive work but didn’t dare to speak up, to oppose or voice their concerns, for fear of stepping on someone’s toes who might be on your future hiring committee.
