It is clear that the affective thinking-feeling is not the thinking or feeling of a particular object – or a particular subject. It pertains more directly to the event, what passes in-between objects and subjects, than to the objects or subjects per se. It is important to emphasize that it is pre-subjective, in the sense that it is so integral to the event’s unfolding that it can only retrospectively be ‘owned’, or owned up to, in memory and post facto reflection, as a content of an individualized experience. But it is even more important to realize that ‘presubjective’ in this usage means transindividual. Affective thinking-feeling is transindividual in two senses. First, in the sense just mentioned, namely that it pertains directly to what is passing between the individuals involved, which is reducible to neither taken separately. And second, in the sense that it coincides with a becoming of the involved individuals. As an event, it is already carrying each beyond itself, making it  other than it is just now, and already more than what it was just then.
