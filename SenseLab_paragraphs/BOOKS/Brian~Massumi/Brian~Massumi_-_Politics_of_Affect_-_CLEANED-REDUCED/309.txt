One thing we experiment with is the question of reconnecting affectively to the collective in a different way, getting away from thinking about ‘being active’ in the sense of ‘doing something’ and focusing instead on the in-act of ‘something doing’. This brings us back to the earlier question of affect: what does it mean to co-compose? To co-compose is to allow for the possibility that we cannot know in advance where the collective value of our project resides. It means to become flexible in our understanding collectively of how value might eventually come to be understood. A collectivity in the way I understand it is always concerned with these speculatively pragmatic questions – speculative because they remain open to invention, pragmatic because they are born of a continual exploration of the in-act. At the SenseLab, one of the ways we move towards this question of collective value is through the concept of eventbased care. Here I don’t mean the subjectivity of human-to-human care, but rather how an event produces an environment that can sustain different kinds of participation which include different affective speeds, including the slownesses that we perhaps associate with depression, or the speeds we associate with anxiety. With event-care perhaps there is a kind of collective tending that comes close to the sense that  Guattari gave to the word ‘therapeutic’. Not therapeutic as individual therapy, but therapeutic in the sense of attending to how an event is capable of producing mutually imbricated modes of existence or modes of living which are sustainable in ways we can’t yet imagine, and which produce new forms of life. I say this very tentatively as I am not at all certain that therapeutic is the right word for this.
