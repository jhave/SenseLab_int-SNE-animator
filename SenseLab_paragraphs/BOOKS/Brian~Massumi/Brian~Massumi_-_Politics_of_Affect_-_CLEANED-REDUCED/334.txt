It makes no sense to define mentality or the physical outside of events. They have to be thought of as contrasting dimensions or modes of activity that co-occur within every event. If you look at it that way, it’s no longer a question of the mind or the subject. You can’t contain the activity of mentality in a noun. Nor can you talk about the body as a substantial thing. You can’t reduce it to substance. You are talking about a mental pole and a physical pole; a mental dimension and a physical dimension; a tendency towards abstraction or extraction from the given, and a tendency towards the stability to be had by prolonging forms of givenness. When you get rid of the substantives, what you are left with are adverbs – qualities of events.
