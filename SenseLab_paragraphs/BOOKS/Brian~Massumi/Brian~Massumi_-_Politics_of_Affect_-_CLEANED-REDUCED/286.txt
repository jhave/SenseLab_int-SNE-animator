Christoph Brunner*: An issue that has been coming up a lot recently regarding affect, in the European and especially German-speaking academic environment, concerns the question of what the politics of affect might be, specifically if you think about affect in relation to immediacy. The critique I  often  hear  is that affect-oriented approaches tend to focus on the immediate without considering the historical background and the  ways  in  which  mediating  frames of  reference  are  constructed.  I  feel  that  it  is  very important to contextualize the notion of experience which needs to be addressed in relation to affect and immediacy.
