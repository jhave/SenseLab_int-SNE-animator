The Implication of Deleuze and Guattari’s calling into question of ideology is that for the understanding of capitalism as a process the concept of affectivity is more fundamental than rationality. A primacy of affect is a necessary corollary of the primacy of relation. But for the concept of affect to be useful here, it must be reconceptualized. It must be rethought in a way that understands it not as fundamentally individual, but as directly collective (as pertaining to relation). And it cannot be reduced to ‘feeling’ as opposed to thinking. It has to be understood as involving feeling in thinking, and vice versa. This requires revisiting the whole notion of rationality – and self-interest. In a process-oriented frame, the thinking-feeling of affect is always directly implicated in an operativity – it pertains more fundamentally to events than to persons. It is directly enactive. What is this enactive thinking-feeling, and what difference does it make in how we can think about capitalism as a mode of power, and about resistance?
