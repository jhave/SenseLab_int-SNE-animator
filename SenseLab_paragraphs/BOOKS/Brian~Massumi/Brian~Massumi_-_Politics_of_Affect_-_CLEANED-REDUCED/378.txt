Affect pertains to ‘raw’ experience. There is no raw experience. All experience is in-formed by prior takings-form. The manner in which prior takingsform in-form subsequent expressions is always inflected by how potential makes ingress into a situation, with what gradations. The arc of potential’s entry into a situation and through it is always modulated on the fly, by very particular mechanisms. Prime among these mechanisms are the ‘abductions’ that texture the landscape of potential through which a coming event will wend its way, in the first flush of its incipiency. Abductions are ‘lived hypotheses’. They are thought in the immediacy of their enactment. This means that they are felt as directly as they are thought. They are thinking-feelings of the import of the situation at hand, replete with competing tendencies and alternative paths. Their enactive nature qualifies them as gestures. Thinking-feelings are speculative gestures: they convoke potential and carry alternatives. As gestures, they do this with style. They do it with technique. There is no expression of affect without technique. It is the nature of affect to be already cultured with technique.
