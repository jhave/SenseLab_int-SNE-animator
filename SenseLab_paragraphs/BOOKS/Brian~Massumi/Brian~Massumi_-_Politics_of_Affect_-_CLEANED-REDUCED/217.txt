The idea that structures of power are powered by energies originating outside their order is encapsulated by Deleuze and Guattari in the paradoxical political formula that structures are ‘defined by what escapes them’. They are always running after different-order movements in the collective field of embodied activity in order to funnel them back into their own channels. A ‘rationality’ is nothing more than the logic of a channelling of that kind. All rationalizations have their seat in affect, and remain creatures of affect – all highminded protestations to the contrary.
All of this complicates the question of servitude because it means that there is no pure realm free of power. If structures of power are always running after different-order movements to feed on, it means that they find ways to feed their own alimentary operations back into the field of emergence. They contaminate the field. They convert movements afoot in the field to their own ends. Among them are tendencies already moving in ways that lend themselves to capture – formative forces of emergence that come in a way conversion-ready. These ‘microfascist’ tendencies are Nietzsche’s ‘reactive forces’, which he analysed in The Genealogy of Morals under the concept of ‘ressentiment’.
