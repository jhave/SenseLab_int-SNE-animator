This is not to say that operating in a more macro, top-down, manner is wrong or should not be undertaken. It’s just to say that if it’s done to the exclusion of micropolitical activity it’s mortifying, even when it’s done for survival’s sake. Sometimes there is no alternative but to centrally impose certain enabling constraints. For example, I’d be very happy if the transition to a renewable-energy future or a global redistribution of wealth or a non-growth paradigm were imposed on the capitalist system. But high-level solutions of that kind are only part of the political equation, and it’s not the part that the affective politics we’ve been talking about specifically addresses.
