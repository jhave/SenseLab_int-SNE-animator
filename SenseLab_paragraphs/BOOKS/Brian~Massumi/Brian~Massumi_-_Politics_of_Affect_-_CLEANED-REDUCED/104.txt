Brian Massumi: It is harder to feel like getting a job is making you autonomous, because there are so many mechanisms of control that come down on you when you do have a job. All aspects of  your  life  involve these mechanisms – your daily schedules, your dress, and, in the United States, it can even involve such invasive procedures as being tested for drugs on a regular basis. Even when you are not on the job, the insecurity that goes  with  having  a  job  and  wanting to keep it in a volatile economy – where there is little job security and the kind of jobs that are available change very quickly – requires you to constantly be thinking of your marketability and what the next job is going to be.  So  free  time  starts  getting  taken  up by self-improvement or taking care of yourself so that you remain healthy and alert and can  perform  at your peak. The difference between your job life and off-job life collapses, there are no longer distinctions between your public and private functions. Being unemployed creates an entirely different set of challenges, constraints and controls, but it is not necessarily completely disempowering. For example, a lot of creative work gets done by people who are unemployed or underemployed.
