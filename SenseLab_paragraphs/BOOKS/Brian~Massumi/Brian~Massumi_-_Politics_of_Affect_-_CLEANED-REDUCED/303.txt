Brian Massumi: Simondon’s concept of anxiety is clearly in dialogue with existentialist and existential phenomenological  thinking.  It’s  a  response  to  the  anxiety attached to Heidegger’s being-towards-death, and to Sartre’s prescription for absolute subjective freedom of decision in the face of anxiety. He’s trying to save our anxieties from either fate. For Simondon, anxiety has to do with the ‘more than oneness’ at the heart of the individual. This is basically the active, relational field of potential we’ve been talking about – what Erin’s been calling the more-than. Simondon calls it the ‘preindividual field’ because it is what the individualized subject emerges, and re-emerges, from. Anxiety is created, according to Simondon, when this open-ended, formative field is mistaken for an interiority of the subject, rather than being recognized as the preindividual field from which the individual emerges as a subject.
