A case in point is the anti-globalization movement. It’s easy to find weaknesses in it, in its tactics or in its analysis of capitalism. But if you wait around for a movement to come along that corresponds to your particular image of the correct approach, you’ll be waiting your life away. Nothing is ever that neat. But luckily people didn’t wait around. They jumped right in and started experimenting and networking, step by step. As a result, new connections have been made between people and movements operating in different regions of the world, on different political levels, from the most local grassroots levels up to the most established NGOs, using different organizational structures. In a very short period of time the entire discourse surrounding globalization has shifted. Actually, not only surrounding it but inside its institutions also – it’s now impossible for an international meeting to take place without issues of poverty and health being on the agenda. It’s far from a solution, but it’s a start. It’s ongoing. That’s the point: to keep on going.
