Darwin himself is one of the famous cases. He spent many years observing earthworms in his back garden. He talks about the improvisational prowess of earthworms in relation to how they perform basic functions like the necessity to close the holes of their burrows to keep invaders or moisture out. He says that there is a general schema to their actions, but that each earthworm, in spite of being brainless, is capable of improvising new solutions that take the contingencies of each situation into account. In other words, they invent variations on the theme. He says explicitly that this attests to a kind of ‘mental power’ or degree of mentality in worms.
