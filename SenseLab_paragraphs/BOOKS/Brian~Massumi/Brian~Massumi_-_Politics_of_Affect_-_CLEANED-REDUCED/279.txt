Brian Massumi: When we talk about value, life and affirming relational intensities of experience, it’s often misunderstood as a celebration of good feeling, good vibes, but that’s not what it’s about. If you want to remodulate relational potentials that overspill the present, you have to in a sense dilate that moment. You have to suspend the ‘chunking’, suspend the crystallizing of pragmatic presuppositions and the precipitous launching into the most prepared and accessible action paths. This involves a certain amount of disorientation, and that can be painful. Even so, it’s still a joy of a kind, because it’s intense, it’s vital. In Always More Than One, Erin calls that intensity of the suspense of a relational modulation under way ‘enthusiasm’. It’s the feeling of vitality that belongs to the relational field. It belongs to individuals only to the degree that they are braced into that field, in differential attunement to its stirring towards movement – its ‘preacceleration’ as Erin says – to the potential making itself felt in it. It isn’t only attached to what we think of as positive emotions. It’s more an intensity of movement, and of processual attention. Raymond Ruyer calls it ‘enthusiasm of the body’, and associates it with play. Our whole being is in it, body and thought, together towards movement. In Semblance and Event, I write of this in terms of ‘vitality affect’, borrowing a term from Daniel Stern (which is also where ‘affective attunement’ comes from), and I call the relational in-bracing it coincides with ‘bare activity’. These are all ways of working through the concept of ‘a’ life as Erin takes it up.
