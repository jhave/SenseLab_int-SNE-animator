Brian Massumi: This question is of great interest to me. I approach it from the point of view of process philosophy, which is centrally concerned with creativity, with where it is found in the world and how it expresses itself. The short answer to that famous question of Spinoza’s, ‘Do we know what a body can do?’ is simply: ‘No!’ There are powers of improvisation, powers of invention in a body that we have only begun to plumb. There are bodily capacities that do not require the presence of a brain or, in animals with a brain, that function independently of conscious calculation. These include capacities that we would have to categorize as capacities to think. I have been writing recently about animality and instinct for a book called What Animals Teach us about Politics.1 I have been particularly taken with the insistence of certain scientists and theoreticians that there is improvisation and even problem-solving in animals without brains.
