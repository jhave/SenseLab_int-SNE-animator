like it was in its disciplinary forms, it’s affective. The media have an extremely important role to play in that. The legitimization of political power, of state power, no longer goes through the reason of state and the correct application of governmental judgement. It goes through affective channels. For example, an American president can deploy troops overseas because it makes a population feel good about their country or feel secure, not because the leader is able to present well-honed arguments that convince the population that it is a justified use of force. So there is no longer political justification within a moral framework provided by the sovereign state. And the media are not mediating any more – they become direct mechanisms of control by their ability to modulate the affective dimension.
