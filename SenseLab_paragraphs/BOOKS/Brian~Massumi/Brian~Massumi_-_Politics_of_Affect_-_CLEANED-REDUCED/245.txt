Bodil Marie Stavning Thomsen: In Semblance and Event you give the example of the Deleuzian timeimage. You can’t see the time-image. It’s not explicitly there, but it’s real, and could be aligned to a diagrammatic or biogrammatic thinking. In order to experience the time-image, you have to hold open the future – and the past that will have led to it. This is done by inserting virtual images into the interstice between the past and the future.
