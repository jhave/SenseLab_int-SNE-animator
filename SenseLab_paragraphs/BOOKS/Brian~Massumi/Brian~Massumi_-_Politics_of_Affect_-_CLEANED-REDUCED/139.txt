Say there are a number of bodies indexed to the same cut, primed to the same cue, shocked in concert. What happens is a collective event. It’s distributed across those bodies. Since each body will carry a different set of tendencies and capacities, there is no guarantee that they will act in unison even if they are cued in concert. However different their eventual actions, all will have unfolded from the same suspense. They will have been attuned – differentially – to the same interruptive commotion. ‘Affective attunement’ – a concept from Daniel Stern – is a crucial piece in the affective puzzle.1 It is a way of approaching affective politics that is much more supple than notions more present in the literature of what’s being called the ‘affective turn’, like imitation or contagion, because it finds difference in unison, and concertation in difference. Because of that, it can better reflect the complexity of collective situations, as well as the variability that can eventuate from what might be considered the ‘same’ affect. There is no sameness of affect. There is affective difference in the same event. Reactions to fear, to turn to that classic example again, vary wildly, and even vary significantly at different times in the same individual’s life.
