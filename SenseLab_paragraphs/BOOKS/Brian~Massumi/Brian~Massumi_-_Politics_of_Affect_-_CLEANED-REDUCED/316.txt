We realized very quickly that the kind of techniques we were looking for had to be impersonal. By that we meant directly collective, like Simondon’s preindividual field in its transindividual becoming. That makes it sound a bit exalted. But it’s really nuts and bolts, procedural in the best sense. The question is always ‘how?’ For example, how do you enter into a situation without just registering your representation of yourself? What conditions can be put in place to make that entry happen on another footing? How do you gesture to participants as they cross the threshold to the event that this time it is an invitation to experiment collectively and invent? How do you say, nonverbally, in the way the event is conditioned, don’t bring your products – bring your process. Don’t bring your thoughts you’ve already had and rehearse them to us as part of positioning yourself bring everything else, your passions, your appetitions, your tools and abilities, your intensest procedures, and connect into the situation from that angle. Don’t perform yourself – co-catalyse a collective event with us. What that’s saying is that you are hereby relieved from the imperative to represent yourself and to be judged accordingly. You can compose, using many more dimensions of what it is you bring into the situation than are normally activatable, in a conference for example. The measure of success of your contributions will not be whether they were correct, or complete, or even authentically you, but rather what affective force they brought to the event. That means that no contribution can be owned, because it doesn’t have effectiveness in itself, but only as creating the conditions for yourself and others as a gift of process potential or a catalyst that can only be effective in the way it resonates with others.
