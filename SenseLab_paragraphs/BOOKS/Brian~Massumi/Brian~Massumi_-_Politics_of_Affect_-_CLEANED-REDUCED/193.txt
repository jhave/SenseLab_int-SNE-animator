embodiments. It is, rather, a reciprocal implication of operations. It is not functional, but operative. It is not structured, but emergently self-structuring. Deleuze and Guattari need to clear away the old baggage of ideology critique in order to think capitalist society as a dynamic process of always ongoing self-structuration.
2thiFsropmoint of view, what ideology critique identifies  as  a  determining  foundation  is  a  result:  a product  of  process,  a  processual  derivative.  Process coagulates into re-emergent regularities which ideology critique tends to reify into parts, understood as societal building blocks such as classes. A dynamic process is not composed of parts. It is composed of operations that are directly relational in nature. By directly relational, I mean that the terms in relation do not pre-exist their relation and then enter into it. They are produced by the relation, and spin off from it. This is very much in keeping with the letter of Marx’s thought. It is the capitalist relation that lies at the heart of his thinking. The worker and the capitalist do not simply enter into this relation. They are constituted by it. Their constitution itself is the regularity of certain spin-off effects that are contrived to accumulate – namely, effects of inequality, unequal access, unequal distribution. The accumulation coagulates in such a way as to determine the capitalist relation to return, ever more insistently, with ever more regularity, pushing ever further into new frontiers. It is less the capitalist structure of society that reproduces itself  than  the  capitalist  relation  that  self-proliferates, always expanding its field. ‘Class’ is a name for this processual accumulation of inequality operating within certain historical parameters of regularity. This changes the status of categories like ‘worker’ and ‘capitalist’.
