Brian Massumi: I think they definitely are. It would help to try to talk a little bit more about the change in capitalism and what that constitutes, and then go back to that question. Thinkers like Negri say that the products of capitalism have become more intangible, they’ve become more informationand service-based. Material objects and physical commodities that were once the engine of the economy are becoming more and more peripheral, in profit terms. For example, the cost of computers keeps plummeting. It’s difficult to make a profit from their manufacture because there’s a mass of basically identical versions from different companies, and they’re all pretty interchangeable.
