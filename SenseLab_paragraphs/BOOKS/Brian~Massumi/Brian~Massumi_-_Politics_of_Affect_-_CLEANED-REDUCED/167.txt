Brian Massumi: Although the ‘micro’ of micropolitical is not synonymous with small, and although the modulations that might be effected at that level can be widely distributed, there is no better place to start than the local context in which you live and work every day. Macropolitical positioning operates under the illusion that  there  is  a  neutral,  higher-level  vantage  point allowing you to stand outside and judge, while standing pure, correct and unsullied. Critique, practised in this way, does double duty. It opposes, too simplistically I would argue. But it also shields. To judge from outside is to ensconce yourself in an unassailable position. Micropolitically, critique has to come from within, in the thick of things, and that means getting your hands dirty. There is no situation of being outside situation. And no situation is subject to mastery. It is only by recognizing the bonds of complicity and the limitations that come with situation that you can succeed in modulating those constraints at the constitutive level, where they re-emerge and seriate. This is ‘immanent critique’. It is active, participatory critique. For me, micropolitical action involves this kind of immanent critique that actively alters conditions of emergence. It engages becoming, rather than judging what is.
