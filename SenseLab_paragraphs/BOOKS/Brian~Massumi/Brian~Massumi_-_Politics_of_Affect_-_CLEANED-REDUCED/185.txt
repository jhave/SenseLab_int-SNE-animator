In very broad strokes, the basic presuppositions informing the notion of ideology are that society is a structure, and that mechanisms of power defend and reproduce that structure. The structure is an organized whole composed of parts that have specifiable functions and occupy determinate positions within the whole. The relations among the parts have a coherence dictated by the structure of the whole they compose and whose general interests they serve. The coherence of the composition is a certain form of rationality, expressible as a set of mutually cohering propositions – in short, reflected in a structure of ideas. The task of the notion of ideology is to explain a thorny problem that then arises. Namely, that what is in the ‘general interest’ of the structure will never coincide with the specific interests of many of the subordinated working parts. It is likely, however, to coincide quite nicely with one of society’s parts, or a small set of them, occupying a linchpin position. The ‘general interest’ is always really a ‘dominant interest’. Now if the structure embodies a rationality expressible in a coherent structure of ideas, why is it that the subordinated parts – call them ‘classes’ – accept their place? Why can’t they see how the rationality coheres, and what it really means for them? Why don’t they get the idea? Why can’t they see through the mirage of the ‘general’ interest and understand it for what it is – a euphemism for the interests of a dominating class?
