The concept of interest is predicated on a certain notion of value that reduces it to instrumental  ends. Now we’re ready to return to the question of value. The approach I’ve been describing suggests another concept of value. You can call a ‘value’ anything that characterizes a situation – anything that sums up the singular character of the event in which the constituent differentials, tensions and tendency of the situation culminate. The virtual triangle that is seen without actually being seen is a perceptual value summing up that episode of vision. In more complex situations, such as interactions between people in the political context, the value is the singular quality of aliveness, the mode of vitality expressing itself in that encounter as its vitality affect. That mode of vitality has value, or is a value, because it sums up a coming-together of tendencies in an emergent figure. The process of that coming-together  towards that emergence will add itself to the world as another available tendency. Once a value, always a value, in potential. A value is not just reflective of the character of an event. It becomes a key factor in the generation of events that express potential, and that forward it on to subsequent events. A value, once emerged, remains as an attractor for other events to come. It is that forward-pulling attractive force towards the recurrence of a mode of coming-together-for-expression that defines an existential value.
