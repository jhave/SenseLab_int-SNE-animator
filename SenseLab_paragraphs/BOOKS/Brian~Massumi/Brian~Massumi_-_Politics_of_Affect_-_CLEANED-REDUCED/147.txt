All that happens in the cut, in the instant of commotion, microshock, or welling event-suspense. It occurs on the microperceptual level, in an interval smaller than the smallest perceivable, to paraphrase Deleuze. It cannot be consciously perceived. What we perceive is what unfolds from that interpenetration of moments, as the coming event plays itself out. We perceive the trailing into the situation of the past already tending out of that situation towards the future of the event’s having happened. What we experience is like a Doppler effect of the force of time. It is due to this Doppler effect that we experience the moment, that is, that we experience a duration, that we feel time to have extension. That duration is our experience straddling those dimensions of time, as much like a thought as in unfolding action. The duration registers with an affective tonality. We have a primarily qualitative experience of time extension. This qualitatively lived time is what William James called the specious present. It’s ‘specious’ because it’s all coming out of a fissure in time, a cut in time, a shock and suspense. The microshocks don’t stop. They come in droves, all in intervals smaller than the smallest perceivable. All cut, all the time, in infinite division. It is only because an affective tonality envelops groupings of them, continues through or around them, that we feel the moment as having  extension,  rather than feeling it implode into an infinitely proliferating fractal cut. It is the quality of the experience that makes the moment, and gives it its continuity, that makes it a duration. The present is held aloft by affect. This is also something that Whitehead insists on: affect is not in time, it makes time, it makes time present, it makes the present moment, it’s a creative factor in the emergence of time as we effectively experience it, it’s constitutive of lived time.
