Brian Massumi: Yes, very much so. But I also understand how Whitehead’s own vocabulary, when it comes to social and political issues, can make one cringe. From our historical vantage point, and in particular from a non-Eurocentric perspective, it is difficult to abide such terms as ‘progress’ and ‘civilization’ as the basis for political thinking. But if you look at what Whitehead was getting at through those now tainted terms, his thinking remains highly relevant today. When he speaks of ‘civilization’ it is not with reference to any form of group identity. Instead, he speaks of contrast. Basically, what he calls the civilizing process is the ability to hold contrasts together. It’s about making forms or formations that have tended to mutually exclude each other cohabit the same field, not in spite of their difference, but affirming it as a value. This involves relational techniques for creating inclusive field conditions making what was mutually exclusive compossible. The mutual inclusion of contrasting forms in the same field is an intensification of that field. ‘Progress’ for Whitehead is the achievement of ever greater intensity. It is not  a linear advance towards a predesignated end. It is not teleological. It is the invention of new fields of mutual inclusion, and that invention has all the singularity of the collectively self-structuring events I was just talking about, which have tendency but without teleology.
