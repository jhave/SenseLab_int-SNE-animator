Capitalism’s mantra is  ‘productivity’.  In  the  era of biopower, what bodies are meant to produce is essentially their own economically productive lives – integrally self-converting into ‘human capital’. Life itself has become integrally capital-intensive. Those away from whom the augmentation of powers of existence flows, those around whom the inequalities of the process accumulate, are not in a position to constitute themselves as human capital to a ‘competitive’ degree. They are not in a position to personify the self-productive powers of the process of capital at full intensity. They are bemoaned as insufficiently ‘productive’. They are left behind by the movement of capital. In a regime of biopower, they are as good as dead. The flipside of biopower is the ‘necropolitics’ theorized by Achille Mbembe in response to the debate on biopower.
