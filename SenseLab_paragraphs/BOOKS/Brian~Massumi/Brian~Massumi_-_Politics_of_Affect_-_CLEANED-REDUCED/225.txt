There is a certain slippage that has occurred in our discussion. We began by discussing capitalism, and have ended up talking about structures  of  domination  that are tacitly on the model of the state. Everything I have just said about microfascism and structures of domination has to be thoroughly reconceptualized in relation to capitalism. This is because capitalism, as I was saying at the beginning of this interview, is not a structure in any usual sense of the term. It is much too protean and fluidly self-organizing to be a structure. It is often called a ‘system’. But even this is perhaps too static a concept. Capitalism is an open system, coextensive with society. It is so dynamically self-modulating that it is best to call it a ‘process’, in contradistinction both to ‘structure’ and to ‘system’. It is self-modulating and self-amplifying, from a posture immanent to the field of life. It has fed its operations back into the field of emergence of bare activity so integrally as to become-immanent to it. The capitalist relation is everywhere, potentially. Every move made anywhere, from the farthest corner of the earth to the most intimate depths of the soul, is susceptible to capitalist  capture.
