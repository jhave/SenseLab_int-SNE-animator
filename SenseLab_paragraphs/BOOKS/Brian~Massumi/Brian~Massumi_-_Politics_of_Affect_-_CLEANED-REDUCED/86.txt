top-down state apparatuses that can really claim effective control over their territory. Old-style sovereignty is a thing of the past. All borders have become porous, and capitalism is feeding off that poracity and pushing it further and further – that’s what globalization is all about. But there have to be mechanisms that check those movements, so policing functions start to  proliferate, and as policing proliferates so do prisons. In the US they’re being privatized and are now big business. Now policing works more and more in the way I was just describing, through gatekeeping – detection, registration and feedback. Police action, in the sense of an arrest, comes out of this movement-processing loop as a particular kind of feedback. Instead of passing through the gate, a gun is detected by the machine, and a police response is triggered, and someone gets arrested. Police power becomes a function of that other kind of power, that we were calling control, or movement-based power. It’s a local stop-action that arises out of the flow and is aimed at safeguarding it. The boom in prison construction comes as an offshoot of the policing, so you could consider the profits made by that new industry as a kind of surplus-value of flow. It’s a vicious circle, and everyone knows it. No matter how many prisons there are, no matter how many people they lock up, the general insecurity won’t be lessened. It just comes with the territory, because for capitalism to keep going, things have to keep flowing. Free trade and fluidity of labour markets is the name of the game. So no matter how many billions of dollars are poured into surveillance and prison building, the threat will still be there of something getting through that shouldn’t. Terrorism is the perfect example.
