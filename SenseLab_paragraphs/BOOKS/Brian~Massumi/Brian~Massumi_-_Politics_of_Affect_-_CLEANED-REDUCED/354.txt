relational milieu that had its own unique complexion, a unique affective tonality, even though the kind of event that was about to take place was so well known to him. Crossing the threshold of any event, you move into a relational field that presents a certain newness, no matter how hackneyed the occasion. Almost all events do belong to a genre. It is of the nature of events to come in series. To the extent to which the event belongs to a series, it carries certain generic presuppositions that are immediately in play. They are like default settings that activate as we cross the threshold. But the event can never be reduced to its conformity to those default settings. Looked at from another perspective, the presuppositions in play are a necessary enablement for the difference in what happens – just as the structures of musical genres are a necessary enablement for improvisation. The variation on what happens can go so far as to make the genre itself cross a threshold, in which case a new genre might emerge, as was the case with jazz. When the variation stays within the perceived bounds of its received genre, it still enlivens. It gives the genre the power to remain compelling, even after so many repetitions, and to continue producing variations on itself as it continues its seriation.
The point about the newness and variation of even the most pre-formatted events is important because it relates the concept of presupposition – the notion that there are pre-reflexive default settings informing our activity that are activated at the threshold to events – to the multiplicities of potential I was just talking about in terms of tendency. The theory of presupposition that I find most useful comes from the pragmatic linguist Oswald Ducrot. He describes the presuppositional fields
