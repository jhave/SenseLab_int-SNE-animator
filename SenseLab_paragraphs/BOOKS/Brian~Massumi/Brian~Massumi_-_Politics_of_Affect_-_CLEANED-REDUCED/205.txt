Looked at from this perspective, affect is a differential attunement between two bodies in a joint activity of becoming. What I mean by differential attunement is that the bodies in encounter are both completely absorbed in the felt transition, but they are differently absorbed, coming at it asymmetrically, from different angles, living a different complexion of affecting-being affected, transitioning through the encounter to different outcomes, perhaps structured into different  roles. But all of these differences are actively, dynamically co-implicated in the event, as immediate dimensions of the event, the same unfolding event. It is the same event that is integrally lived by both â€“ integrally but heterogeneously; synchronously but asymmetrically. The event is the integral of the differences. It is the curve of their affective integration. The arc of their thought-felt, unfolding co-implication.
But why limit the discussion to two bodies? Life is full of situations including a plurality of bodies, similarly differentially attuned to an event playing through the situation. If you think of media events in particular, they involve multitudes of bodies. The example of the blow is just a convenient limit-case. Multiplicity is more the rule. For the concept of affect to take on its full force and furthest implications, it is necessary to think of it as involving a multiplicity. Every encounter  between two bodies always has the potential to open up  to more. The concept of affect applies most properly to populations.
