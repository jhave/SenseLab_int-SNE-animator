Immanent critique, as its name implies, cannot purport to  apply  already-established   criteria   of   correctness or necessity to the field of collective action. It cannot operate in the imperative, based on a prior political programme or already structured set of moral precepts. It  cannot  justify  itself  by  appealing  to  established principles. It immanently enacts its own principle, which is one with its exemplary movement. There is no ought to resistance. On what basis can we say that it is better to desire one’s freedom than one’s servitude? That one ‘ought’ to resist? An ‘ought’ is nothing but an already assumed servitude to a higher order of imperative. To say ‘ought’ is to enact our servitude to abstract principle, and to justify our imposing it on others, as from outside and above. It’s a power move. As such, it carries seeds of domination – perhaps a new order of domination, but domination nonetheless. Freedom, like oppression, is desired, or it is nothing at all. It cannot be ‘oughted’ and imposed. It cannot be inculcated. It is desired, or it is nothing. Resistance is the counter-desire for the collective augmentation of powers of existence, in dynamic mutual inclusion in an intensive field of contrasts. There is no basis on which we can say it is ‘better’ in principle. But there are ways to perform its desirability – to make it more desired, more strongly tended towards, more amplificatory and exemplary. There are indeed techniques of resistance. They are techniques of relation aimed at immanent field-modulation. They are gestures already in relation, in participatory immersion, stirring towards self-augmenting relational movement.
