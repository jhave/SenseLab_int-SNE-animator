Christoph Brunner: Avoiding these kinds of pre-defined stakes and constantly re-enliving collective thinking, practising and writing, leads to a very different sense of necessity. The question of necessity then has to do with how to avoid generalizing the use of language, and how we think and talk about language. So it doesn’t come as something which can be imposed in an academic way of naming. I am thinking here about Deleuze’s work and how he writes against naming in the way it is usually practised because it imposes a prefigured structure that is not led by necessity in the immediacy of what you are relationally negotiating. What would be the politics of necessity in the way we’re talking about it?
