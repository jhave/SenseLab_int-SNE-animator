Affect is asocial. Corollary: Affect must be socialized through mechanisms of mediation. Affect, as the openness to being affected, is directly relational. It is pure sociality, in the sense of the social in the openness of its incipiency, ready to become all manner of social forms and contents. That readiness is not simply a passive availability. It is an active pressure towards taking-form. It has an appetite for  its own eventuation and final  characterization.  It  is an as-yet indeterminate determination to be determined. It is tendency: a determination to be determined with an appetite not only to express itself, but to do so repeatedly, with something happening differently every time, at least in some small way. Far from being asocial, affect is the ongoing force of the social taking evolving form. Affect comes to determinate expression through actually occurring encounters. The evolving social expression of affect hinges on the immediacy of events. The events relay each other, forming event series, tracing lineages of recurrence. Tendencies are brought to serial expression in and through events. What recurs in each event in the lineage is the immediacy of this evolving taking-form. Affect is the ongoing  immediation  of the social.
