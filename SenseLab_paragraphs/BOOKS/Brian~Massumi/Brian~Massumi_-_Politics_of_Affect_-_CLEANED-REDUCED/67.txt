have pretty much abandoned control in the sense of ‘power over’. That corresponds to the first flush of ‘disciplinary’ power in Michel Foucault’s vocabulary. Disciplinary power starts by enclosing bodies in topdown institutions – prisons, asylums, hospitals, schools and so on. It encloses in order to find ways of producing more regularity in behaviour. Its aim is to manufacture normality – good, healthy citizens. As top-down disciplinary power takes hold and spreads, it finds ways of doing the same thing without the enclosure. Prisons spawn halfway houses, hospitals spawn community clinics and home-care, educational institutions  spawn the self-help and career retooling industries. It starts operating in an open field. After a certain point it starts paying more attention to the relays between the points in  that  field,  the  transitions  between  institutions, than to the institutions themselves. It’s seeped into the in-between. At this point it starts to act directly on the kinds of interference and resonation effects  I  was just mentioning. It starts working directly on bodies’ movements and momentum, producing momentums, the more varied and even erratic the better. Normality starts to lose its hold. The regularities start to loosen. This loosening of normality is part of capitalism’s dynamic. It’s not a simple liberation. It’s capitalism’s own form of power. It’s no longer disciplinary institutional power that defines everything, it’s capitalism’s power to produce variety – because markets get saturated. Produce variety and you produce a niche market. The oddest of affective tendencies are OK – as long as they pay. Capitalism starts intensifying or diversifying affect, but only in order to extract surplus-value. It hijacks affect in order to intensify profit potential. It
