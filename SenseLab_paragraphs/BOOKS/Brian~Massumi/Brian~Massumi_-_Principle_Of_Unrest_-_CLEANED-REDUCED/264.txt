A radical pedagogy:
	1. Proceeds rigorously through technique.
	2. Uses the technique to jump start an event of expression. 
	3. Strategizes the jump-starting of the event in such a way as to take up a finite collection of utterers and interpreters in a collective movement of thought. 
	4. Collateralizes expression so as to bring the situation of the event to singular expression.
	5. Brings the situation to singular expression in a way that gives complete existence to the situation's real potential as potential, objectively infinite.
	6. Is attentive to the manner in which every expression also expresses its own expression, building on that to double the objectively infinite potential of the situation with an expression-of-expression that enables the event to reference its own process, so as to correct, perfect, and vary its own technique.
	7. Leaves loose ends, releasing and remaindering potential in a way that it self-forwards across the gaps to a next event in a different mode of practice, relaying the expressive event into situations and techniques beyond itself.
	8.  Takes this outdoing of itself to be its content, in dogged resistance to any notion of knowledge in terms of a content separable from the event of its own expressive self-production.
	9. Transduces rather than transmits.
