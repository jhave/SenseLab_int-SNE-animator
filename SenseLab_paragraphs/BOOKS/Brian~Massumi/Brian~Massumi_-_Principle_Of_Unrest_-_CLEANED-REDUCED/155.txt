The time-signature of preemption leads to a paradox. This is a strange kind of paradox that makes everything done in the name of preemption right and true, even if it was wrong (rather than merely undecidable as to its truth or falseness). This is the paradox of the "could-have/would-have," also explicitly articulated by Bush: it turns out, he opined, that Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction; but he could have had them for all we knew; and he is the sort that if could have had them, he would have had them forthwith, and he would have used them without a second thought. Therefore, we were right to invade Iraq. The proof? Iraq did indeed become a breeding ground of terrorism.
