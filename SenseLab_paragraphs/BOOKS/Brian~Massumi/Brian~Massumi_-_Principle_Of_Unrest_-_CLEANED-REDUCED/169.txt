Brian Massumi: Like a lot of people, I have to get up and move. I tend to pace, or do something else that's rhythmic. It’s often when I’m in movement and not specifically thinking about what I’m writing that the ideas come. It puts me into the movement of the writing itself. When I was learning to translate, I quickly realized that it’s as important, if not more important, to analyze the rhythm of the language. The semantic aspects aren’t separate from the rhythm, and other non-semantic factors. I started thinking in terms of managing the paces and pulses of ideas, and the fields of ambiguity surrounding the concepts. Not all ambiguities are equal. Each phrase is surrounded by a field of ambiguity carrying sets of connotations, some broader, others more narrow, some readily accessible, others backgrounded. How they all come together, and the tensions between them, inflects the reading. If you just translate what's there, you miss the inflection, you miss the movement. To translate "faithfully," as if there were a one-to-one correspondence between words in different languages, is just a rigorous way of falsifying. It's the bane of academic translating. There isn't even a one-to-one correspondence between the words that are there in one language and the textual movement of meaning production. Meaning is always fielded.
