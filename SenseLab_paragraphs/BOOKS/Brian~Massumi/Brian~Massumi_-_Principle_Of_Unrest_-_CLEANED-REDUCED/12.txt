BM: Capitalism no longer just assembles its products from raw materials and fabricated components, and then launches them into circulation. That scenario assumes a predesigned product, and a meaningful separation between the realm of production and the realm of circulation. Today, those realms have largely collapsed into each other. Contemporary capitalism is increasingly concerned with setting in place the conditions for its products to emerge. They are not only made to emerge, but this happens as a by-product of circulation itself. There are many ways this happens. Examples are the feedback loops that have formed between crowdsourcing and the data-mining of internet, cell phone traffic, and credit-card use on the one hand, and product-development and marketing on the other. The network becomes a matrix of emergence for products that do not preexist, but take shape in and through networked circulation. In the ebb and flow, marketing potentials appear like waves cresting on a sea of movements. These are skimmed off, "mined," then concretized as new products to be sold for profit. You could look at the profit generated as embodying a "surplus-value of flow": a yield of added value emerging from the complexity of movements under way, directly as a function of them. Philosophically speaking, capitalism has learned to motorize itself immanently to its own movements.
