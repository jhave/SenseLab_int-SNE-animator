It is important to note that anti-capitalist counter-ontopowers have to be defined in relation to both absolute limits at the same time: as a partaking in the potential of bare activity at the immanent limit, and concurrently as a tendency moving through the institutional landscape toward an ulterior limit. You could envision the two types of absolute limit as operating along different coordinate dimensions, one horizontal, at the far end of the line through the history of capitalism vectors (the ulterior limit), and the other vertical, having to do with the field of ontogenetic emergence that infra-infests that history with bare activity at every point along the way, feeding its onward trajectory with potentials that may be capturable but never without remainder, so that they are always also potential lines of escape (the immanent limit).
