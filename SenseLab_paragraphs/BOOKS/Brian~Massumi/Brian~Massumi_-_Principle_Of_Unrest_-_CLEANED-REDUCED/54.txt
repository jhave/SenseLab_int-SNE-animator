BM: The idea is that the capitalist field is rife with tendencies embodying relations that cannot be reduced to the capitalist relation itself. It is not only rife with them, they are constantly self-multiplying and differentiating â€“ leading to the corresponding multiplication and differentiation of the apparatuses dedicated to their capture and their channeling into institutional and quasi-institutional self-drivings. Each mechanism of capture piggy-backs on an emergent tendency. Some of the emergent tendencies are symbiotic only as a ruse, or as a first camouflaged move toward a fuller expression. If that expression were to be taken to its logical conclusion, the resulting movement would fully realize other values than capitalist value, and would inevitably become antagonistic to capitalism itself. These tendencies are parasites in the pores of the body of capitalist society. They originate as adventitious growths.
