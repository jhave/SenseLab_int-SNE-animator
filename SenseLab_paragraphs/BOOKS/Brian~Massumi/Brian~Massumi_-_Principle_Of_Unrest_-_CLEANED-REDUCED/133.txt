So, this is my prescription: relational groping in error, toward a more adequate embodiment of the  complexities of the field of life. An embrace of the cyclic, corrective return to bare activity. A noncognitive respect for the crowded affective field. A sympathetic posture of differential mutual inclusion of all of its teaming creatures, however alien their perspectives. A joy in the potential to be regained, snatched from the jaws of objective illusion, even in experiences whose hedonic tone is negative, even in discomfiture. This potential regained is experienced, purely qualitatively, as a surplus-value of life that worth living for itself, purely for the process, purely for the movement and how the movement moves.
