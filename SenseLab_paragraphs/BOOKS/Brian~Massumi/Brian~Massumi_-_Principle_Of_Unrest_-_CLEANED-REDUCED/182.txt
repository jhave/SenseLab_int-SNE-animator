So you have to think in terms of rupture and continuity at the same time, which means putting them together processually. It's a distraction that goes nowhere to talk about them as oppositions or contradictions, because that's not what they are. They're co-factors in process. They co-occur, and events happen between them. The way that co-occurring plays out will give the event a certain arc, a certain lifetime, depending on how it’s conditioned, how it’s energized. And then it will dissipate, it will "perish," as Whitehead says. Every event, however mundane, however small, has a singularity to it. There’s always something different about how it plays out, there's a unique experiential flavor to it. So when we talk about the "new" from a process philosophy point of view, we’re not talking about a new object, or a new thing, or new gadget, or even a new function. We’re talking about the singularity of events – how each is a unique coming-about, even if it's also a repetition, even if the "same" event, like taking a step, which has happened a million times before. The new has to do with what Daniel Stern calls "vitality affect." That's the sense of this happening here and now, just this once in just this way – and then it's gone. It's the registering of the singularity of this event. The new is the event's eventfulness. It's the event-quality of the event. It's not a characteristic or property of things.
