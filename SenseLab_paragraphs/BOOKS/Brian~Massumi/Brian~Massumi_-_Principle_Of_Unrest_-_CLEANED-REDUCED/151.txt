The dominant mode of ontopower crystallized as a military move. I am referring to preemption. That is the idea that I talk about in Ontopower that threat has become so ubiquitous and unpredictable that it is apt to irrupt into a full-fledged danger anywhere, in any form, at any moment. Threat is now by nature "asymmetrical": it is fleeter and suppler than the plodding top-down apparatuses of the traditional military organization and deliberative political decisionmaking. To wait until a threat materializes into a full-fledged danger is too late: it will already have hit before you know it. So you have to hit it before it emerges. This is how George W. Bush put it in his administration's official military stategy.
