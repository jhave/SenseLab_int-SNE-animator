The collective is dedicated to the invention of techniques for forstering new, emergent modes of relation at the intersection of art, philosophy, and activism. Erin Manning and I described its ethos and some of its techniques in our book Thought in the Act (2014). The SenseLab's way of working seeks to avoid reproducing not only hierarchy, but any self-perpetuating governing structure. This entails refusing any formal decision-making procedures, whether vote-based or consensus-based. The idea is activate tendencies agitating at the infra-individual level, in order to bring them to expression in such a way that they play out transindividually, in collective experimentations whose improvisational character prevents what takes place from being attributable to individuals. This generates a kind of surplus-value of life that is irreducibly collective, and entirely event-based. We see the proposed Adventure Capital currency as a kind of event-derivative (there is a suggestion to call it "Occurrency"), but unlike existing derivatives, it will function according to what is basically a gift economy, without debt or credit. The "decisions" made along the way are self-deciding: they come from the way in which the tendencies in play in the event play out among themselves, weighted only by the affective force they effectively mobilize, as "measured" by what creative propositions take hold with a collective momentum that carries them to realization.
