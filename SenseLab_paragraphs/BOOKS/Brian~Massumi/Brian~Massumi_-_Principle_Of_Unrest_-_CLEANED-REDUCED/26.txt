BM: It is important, in thinking about what democracy could become, to try to theorize this becoming integrally-affective of politics and the role of the dividual. This has to be done without giving credence to the idea that rationality and affectivity are opposites (rather, deconstructing that opposition). It is critical to be able to think about and experiment with the ways in which affectively-based politics can give rise to radically inclusive forms of direct democracy.
