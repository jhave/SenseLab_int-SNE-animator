AH: That’s super interesting to me because it obviously connects to a recurring gesture in the rich history of creative writing practices: a giving over of oneself to other forces. I’m thinking about automatic writing, for example, but here it’s not so much that you are giving yourself over to the unconscious, but to the non-conscious. Through attention to rhythm, an experience of temporality is opened and present to the process of writing.
