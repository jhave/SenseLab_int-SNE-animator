The technique of conceptual speed dating is designed to stage a collective encounter between a group of readers and a text, at the point where each side is outdoing itself: participants are brought out of their personal opinions, preestablished positions, and expert identities, at the same time as the text is made to outpace itself with its own tendencies. At that point, a power of thought that cannot be reduced to either the text or the readers as an aggregate of individuals is released as a vector: a creative vector in the direction of new thought. This can be achieved without the speed dating technique, for example through a sustained reading-group practice based on a dedication to "hypothetical sympathy," safeguarded by a culture of that kind of reading, an ethos tended by all involved.
