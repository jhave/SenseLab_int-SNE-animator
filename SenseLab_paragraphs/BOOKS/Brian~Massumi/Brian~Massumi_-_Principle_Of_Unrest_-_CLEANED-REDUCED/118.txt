This brings us to the idea of objective illusion. The objective illusion in what I've just described is treating the object as the efficient cause of the pain, danger, or worry: as a simple, isolatable cause in a linear, one-to-one connection to a sad result. The cause, however, in its fullness, is relational. It is the playing out of the relational field itself, in its integrality. The causation is not fully externalizable. In its fullness, it is immanent to the event of the field's integral playing out. It cannot be simply located on the "outside," because the potentials for acting otherwise that the field harbors cannot be exhaustively projected. Their full spectrum cannot be perceived on the outside. They can only be lived-out, immanently.
Stupidity is when the objectified attribution of external causality, which is necessary but also necessarily incomplete, becomes a node around which an entire mode of life is organized. Pain anticipated becomes a generalized posture of fear. The posture of fear is itself felt as a second-order pain, leading to over-vigilance and resentment. This in turn can lead to an over-generalized reaction that, at the extreme, can extend to hatred of the entire class of objects with which the pain is identified. The merest hint of a threat that can be in any way associated with that class of object becomes a trigger.
