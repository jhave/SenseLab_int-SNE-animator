AH: When they arise in social bodies or movements, these micropolitical tactics that youâ€™ve been speaking of work a lot through differentiation, and through dissensus, through amorphous collective agency. Is there a tension or a redundancy when one moves to the macropolitical, which seems to need to work through consensus, through whole identifiable agents who activate things in the world, who stake claim to projects that have objectives?
