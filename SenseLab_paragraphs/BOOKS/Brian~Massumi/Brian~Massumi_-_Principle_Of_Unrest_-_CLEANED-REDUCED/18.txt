BM: I said earlier that the economy has become a regime of power in its own right. What I meant is that the capitalist process has made itself an ontopower. This has far-reaching implications for liberal democracy when you consider that according to theorists of neoliberalism, its most astute proponents as well as its critics, neoliberalism does not just produce objects, but also its own subjects. Foucault called the neoliberal subject the "subject of interest," emphasizing that its form is homologous to that of the enterprise. The founding theorists of neoliberalism called this enterprise-subject "human capital." In The Power at the End of the Economy and Ontopower, I try to look at some of the consequences of the way in which capitalism's ontopower extends to the production of the very capitalized individuals, the capital life-forms, that populate its field. The fact that capitalism has found ways to productively access matrices of emergence means that it now increasingly functions at the infra-individual level wherever capital flows â€“ which is everywhere. Capital seeps down to the affective level of felt potential, before life potentials have concretized in a determinate form of life, where life is as-yet emergent.
