BM: Look at the Brexit vote. UK voters voted to "take back their country" from the supra-national EU, but the complexity of the situation actually means that what they may get is their country's breaking apart, with Scotland now reconsidering its own recent vote to stay in the union. They voted to represent their perceived personal and national interests, only to be taken aback by the result, leading to a widespread expression of hand-wringing contrition the very next day, out of sudden doubt that their representation of their interests represented their interests. A resounding decision of indecision.
	
The whole thing was an exercise in the avoidance of the political crux of the matter: that non-representative forms of democracy need to be invented, at the interpersonal, national, and supra-national levels – or better, transversal to them all, in a new kind of infra-trans feedback system yet to be invented. Playing the identity card and the associated discourse of particularist interest, on whatever level, leads nowhere. The plastic bottle of representation, half-full of polluted water, is running on empty. The dividual rules – one way or another. The dividual is the individual divided among itself. This considerably complicates the calculus of interests, which become undecidable within the structure of representation. Perhaps, if new practices are invented for it, rather than in denial of it as is presently the case, the dividual can become the seat of ontopowers counter to capital: counter-ontopowers.
