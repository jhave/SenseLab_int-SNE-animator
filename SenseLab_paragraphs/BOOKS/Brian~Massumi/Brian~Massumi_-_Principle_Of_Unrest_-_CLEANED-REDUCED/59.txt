KW: Speaking of capitalism as an array of systems somehow suggests a degree of stability and order that one hardly can call a reality when facing today's neoliberal mess of uncertainties.
 
BM: That's right. We need more than a concept of system. When we say the "capitalist system" what we are designating is this tangle of insides reciprocally limiting each other with their respective external boundaries and regimes of passage across their thresholds. But capitalism is more than that. More than a system, or even a system of systems or structure of structures, it is a process. A system is defined by its operational closure. A structure is defined by its functional parameters. A process is in touch with a great outside. It is defined by its openness to that great outside: by how it dips into and captures the tendential potentials stirring there. These potentials are unlimited â€“ they are always astir, ready to offer more of themselves. Rather than any in-itself of things, we're talking about the of-itself of the world, the giving-of-itself of the world's potential, the partitive, parturitional movement of formative activity, not yet fully channeled into taking determinate form.
