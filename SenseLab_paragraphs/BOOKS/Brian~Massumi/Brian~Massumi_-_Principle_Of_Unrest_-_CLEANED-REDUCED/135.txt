This way of thinking is endemic to Freud's thought, and also informs Silvan Tomkins's theory of affect. Joy, understood from the neo-Spinozist perspective, is a question of intensity. Intensity is understood in terms of activation. And activiation is understood not in terms of quantifiable tension, but rather as qualitative potential. For me, this is in turn understood in terms of surplus-value of life. Joy can be tinged with any of the categorical affects, even the "darkest."
