AH: Can I ask you then about the role, the function of belief, faith and hope in the political? When you laid a name to the operations of the micropolitical as "a pragmatics of potential," you framed this as neither being buoyed by false hope, nor paralyzed by hopelessness. Iâ€™m wondering about the nature and necessity of belief and hope for political transformation. Is it not the case that people, political subjects, need to feel that they have found belief, that belief is not necessarily an automatism, something just happening to them, but that an important political agency arises from a sense of "ownership" over their beliefs?
