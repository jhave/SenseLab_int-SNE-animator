As immanent formative force of the movement of thought-expression, the quaesitum is the "requaesitum" ("essential ingredient;" Peirce 1998, 404) of making-sense. This Object of the sign is necessarily unexpressed in the sign because it is realized through the unfolding of the process that the sign powers into motion. It is effectively created by the movement of thought actively tending toward it. It is all of this – this unfolding toward a realized fulfillment – that the sign "stands for." It for all of this that it substitutes itself at the inception of the process set in motion by that very standing-for. It is this – the insistence of quaesitum as the necessary ingredient to be sought for –that the sign bears, that is process carries, endures. In short, the Object of the sign is unspecified in the abstract in order to be determinable by process.
	
Seek – and you may not find. There may be no requisite runner present in the situation, or even anywhere in existence.vi However, the verb still functions expressively. It "expresses" a process in the sense of "forcing out (as the juice of a fruit) by pressure" (Merriam-Webster). To pressurize the process of thought-expression, the sign doesn't need an actual object. All that is requisite is a quaesitum, a that-which-must-be-sought juicy enough to whet the appetite: a "would-be" terminus; an attractor taking upon itself, in the form of its being sought, the sign's expressive force. Would-be: the Object of thought-expression points to the conditional. Conditional: of the order of potential. That, finally, is the essential ingredient. Potential – determined to be determined (to paraphrase another Peircean formulationvii) by a process moving thought out, under the pressure of the situation.
