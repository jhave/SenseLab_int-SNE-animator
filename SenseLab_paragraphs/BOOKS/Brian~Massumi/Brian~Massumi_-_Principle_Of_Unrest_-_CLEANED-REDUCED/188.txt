BM: Yes. I think that iterative structure, the structure of variation and repetition, has always been part of every art and every craft. Technology has accelerated it. Everything is pre-adapted for iteration, for quick capture, turnover and distribution. But it's not just a distribution of things, it's also of events. If you think of it that way, it raises a whole new set of questions. It makes reification less of a focus. Things don't stand still long enough to become fixed. There's still reification, but it's just a thinner and thinner threshold between turnovers. Which means that the idea of reification as standardizing and homogenizing is out of date. If you do start from activity as the base concept, and move into an event-based approach, it's really all about singularization. Reification is just a passing phase in a process of continuing variation. Contemporary capitalism is more moving than it is reifying. Which is not to say it's better than its earlier incarnations, like the industrial capitalism that the concept of reification was designed to grapple with.
