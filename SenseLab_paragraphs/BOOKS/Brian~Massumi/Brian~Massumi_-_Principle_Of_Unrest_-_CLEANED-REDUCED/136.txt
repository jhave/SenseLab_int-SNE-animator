In his book on Nietzsche, Deleuze in fact establishes an essential link between joy and tragedy. This is because in when the emergent stirrings of the relational field peak in an event, a cut occurs. The tranquility of the "I," based on its habitual anticipations of a certain regularity, is shattered. This is another meaning of the shizz: the "I" is sundered from "within" (from movements to the ulterior limit folding back-under to the immanent limit, in-coming forth). It is cracked open by strikes of potential whose sudden effectuation hit it like fate. A crack opens between the past and the future, cutting across the anticipatable regularities that normally run from one to the other through the thickness of the present. Fate is the present without thickness, pure cut. In it, the "I" confronts the uncontrollably larger-than-I of the field of life erupting: what Peirce, with uncharacteristic evocativeness, called the "strange intruder." The stranger intruder is not another person. Neither is it the mirror-image alter-ego of the "I." Again, in the example, the mirror reflected an embedded perspective on the world. The strange intruder, Peirce says, is the "non-I." The non-I is of another order than the "I." Taken at its widest connotation, it is the event "in person" (representing nothing but itself, meaning nothing but the transformation it brings) with whose complexity "I" must join affective forces in order to live life to fullest potential. Joy is the affirmation of the event, in all its multi-perspectival glory.
