Preemption is entirely bound up with security. Wherever security mechanisms are taken, the logic of preemption is in some way activated. So while preemption crytallized in its baldest, most extreme form as a mode of military power, it has proliferated piggy-backed on security concerns. It is also a policing logic on the domestic front. And it is a financial logic â€“ derivatives as a "securitization" strategy says it all.  It has gone viral. Ontopower explores the viral logic of preemption, with a focus on its weaponization of the relation between the field of immanence and perception and the dynamics of the affective contagions this produces.
