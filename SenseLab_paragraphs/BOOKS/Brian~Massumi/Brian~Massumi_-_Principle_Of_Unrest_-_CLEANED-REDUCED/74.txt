One example is the open source movement, which hijacks the digitality driving the networking of capitalism toward the production of surplus-values of non-proprietary cooperation: surplus-values of the flow of cooperation. What I am pointing to here relates to property, but perhaps even more directly to another of the ulterior limits of capitalism that I mentioned: quantification; a notion of value that is fundamentally quantitative. Cooperation is immeasurable. It is experienced, qualitatively, as a value in itself. Cooperation is something that isther encouraged by neoliberalism in its own service: one of its catchwords is "team work," which has spawned a whole industry of management consulting. But in the case of the open source movement, cooperation is the object of a passional affirmation that can find itself in acute antagonism with property rights.
