AH: Part of what you’re invoking in these phenomena seem to be elements of experience that are in some way or another excessive, unpossessable. But I’m wondering how this relates to aesthetics in the sphere of what people are calling the "experience economy," where what is being traded, bought and sold is no longer simply a material object, but a set of affects associated with objects or an experience itself, or a "service" as one might say, in slightly older language. There has been a vast expansion of experiential practices in contemporary art in the last twenty or thirty years: the development of relational art, then participatory practices, the reincorporation of performance art into the visual arts institutions, and now dance has followed this assimilation. So I’m wondering what you think of experiential art practices in this capitalized context? What happens to those aspects and dynamics of excess, of redundancy or waste, when capital has become so great at turning those very phenomena into value?
