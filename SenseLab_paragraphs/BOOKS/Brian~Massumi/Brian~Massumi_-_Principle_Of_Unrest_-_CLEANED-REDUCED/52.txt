Repeat this analysis, based on degrees of inclusion and relative autonomy, for every institution or quasi-institution cohabiting the contemporary field of capitalist life. You then get the image of a field that is bathed through and through with the capitalist relation, but also rife with other modes of relation that are capturable by different apparatuses, and channeled by each toward a dedicated form of surplus-value whose production fuels the apparatus in question, driving it forward into its own future operations. This self-driving of each apparatus describes a tendency: a way of orienting to the future. Now consider that institutions and quasi-institutions are historically emergent, and that capitalist socieity is highly conducive to their emergence, multiplication, and differentiation â€“ what is referred to as its "pluralism" and, rightly or wrongly, identified with the representative form of government originating with the nation-states of the capitalist center.
