The research-creation laboratory I work with, the SenseLab, is collaborating with a group called the Economic Space Agency to explore this possibility. The aim is to invent affectively charged online modes of operation that foster collective action offline, in a way that is experienced as the generation of a surplus-value of life. There would be an internal currency pegged to the offline qualitative creation of surplus-value of life (we're still working on models for that). The currency would be convertible to fiat – we call it Adventure Capital – but internally to the DAO it would operate according to a different logic. It would be owned collectively, without division into individual shares, and would be only used to further the activities of the collective, which will take the new name of the Three Ecologies (after a book title of Guattari's).
