A sign does not impress an abstract meaning on the mind. More fundamentally, it poses a question to the situation. Some: someone, something. But which one(es)? The sign points not to a thing, but to an event which it "directs us to seek" (Peirce 1998: 406). The verb powers this collateral action of seeking (what Peirce terms "collateral observation"). The sign's sense – its meaning, import, enunciative force – is none other than this powering of an expressive movement inviting a relay into collateral observation and an embodied movement of exploration supplementing the action of the verb.
