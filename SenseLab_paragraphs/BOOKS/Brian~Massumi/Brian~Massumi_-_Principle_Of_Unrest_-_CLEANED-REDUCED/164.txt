However, that surplus-value of perception is not produced for itself, but for the service its playing-out provides for the furtherance of the capitalist process. Preemption's capture of change is captured for capital. It could-have/would have forms a closed loop, channeling the futurity of potential back into capitalist channels. Preemption preempts the openness of the future to the great outside of potential, pre-formating it for capture by the capitalist process. It makes the future actionable only in order to close it back down, to recapture it in the capitalist relation and the limits of the process it governs.
