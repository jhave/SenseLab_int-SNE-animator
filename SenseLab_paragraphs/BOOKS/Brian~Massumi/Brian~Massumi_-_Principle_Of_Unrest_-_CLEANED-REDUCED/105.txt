BM: The reason I distance myself from words like illusion is that it brings up the old image, associated with the mid-twentieth-century critique of fascism, of the "masses" deluded by those who know. The idea is that there are those who know, and oppress, and there are those who know even better, and can liberate. Those who know better can outfox those in the know and provide a beacon of reasoned understanding and rational hope, and the two combined into an effective strategy, to the poor deluded masses. Then there is the cynical version that says that no one knows better, but no one knows better than I that no one knows better, so you might as well forget about your pipe-dreams of direct democracy, stop expecting your sappy occupying to do anything but lead to a few hugs from strangers, and just listen to me. This is the Zizek version. I know that neither of these is the way you meant it.
