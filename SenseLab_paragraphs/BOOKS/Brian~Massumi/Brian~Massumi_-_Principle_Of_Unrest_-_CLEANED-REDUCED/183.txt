AH: Itâ€™s a slightly obvious question but maybe it produces something interesting: that seems to imply then that there may be very little distinction between an aestheticized event and a natural event as such. The aesthetic runs all the way through perceived reality. But for an artist, that might be a difficult thought. There is quite an investment in traditions of art and performance practice, of rupturing forms, by opening to the event, to the occasion. Are there any specific qualities that you would identify with an aesthetic event that you would not identify with a natural one?
