The capitalist field is swarming with non-capitalist tendencies. These are to some extent aided and abetted by neoliberal capitalism's own supernormal tendency, which opens the pores wider than normal, creating elbow room for adventitious tendencies following a different logic. Everything possible is done to bring these tendencies into the fold. They are articulated with the capitalist relation by the apparatuses of capture that feed off them. But there is always a remainder, a left-over of bare activity passionally agitating the capitalist field. You could even say that the fundamental antagonism of captialism under neoliberalism, at least as fundamental as class, is the antagonism between monetized, capitalist surplus-value and noncapitalist, purely qualitative surplus-value â€“ what I call surplus-value of life.
