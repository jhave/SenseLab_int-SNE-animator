This means that the "tragedy" of the event most often takes "minor," relatively neglected forms. What Erin Manning (2016) calls "minor gestures" can pick up on and amplify the otherwise negligible effects of liminal events. The everyday practice of the minor gesture is far more important than the grand gesture of the militant's faithfulness to the "rare" event. One of the problems with grand gestures (and there are many) is that they leave one in wait for the rare event, deactivated. They are a good excuse to do a lot of nothing, other than trumpet one's own ability to recognize the rare event when it comes and be faithful to it in a way that only the rare few can. There is an astounding arrogance to that idea, and a divisiveness that easily leads to violence (clearly seen in the Jacobin overtones of many currents of thought associated with this way of thinking).
