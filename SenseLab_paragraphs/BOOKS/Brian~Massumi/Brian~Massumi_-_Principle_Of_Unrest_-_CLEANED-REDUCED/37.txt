This is value not unlike the way in painting we speak of the value of a color. This is where I want to take my work next: toward a rethinking of politics based on a chromatic theory of value (Massumi 2017). The basis for a chromatic politics can be found in the work of Whitehead and Ruyer, and in a unique formulation in the work of Fred Moten (although Moten would have serious reservations about rehabilitating the term value).
