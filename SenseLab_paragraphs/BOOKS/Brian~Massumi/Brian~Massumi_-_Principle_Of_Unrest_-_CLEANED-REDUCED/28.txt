BM: Yes, but as Brexit has shown once again, in the networked, affectively energized political environment, the referendum is but a caricature of it. Prefigurative glimpses of what it could be have been seen in the spontaneously self-organizing movements of the 2010s, from Occupy and the indignados forward through events like 2016's Nuit Debout, and their power of contagion across identity lines. Nothing like a definitive model has emerged. But something has been stirring. The politics-to-come will likely have no definitive model, by dint of transformative movement. No one model, but many relational matrices, in resonance and interference. That prospect is uncertain, even unsettling, but the alternative is downright frightening: a return of a kind of affective politics more akin to the one whose ravages we know only all too well from the history of the twentieth century â€“ the radically exclusive anti-democratic movements of fascism. These also are stirring, in the same cauldron of bare activity, immanent to the same field of complexity.
