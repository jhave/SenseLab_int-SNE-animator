This "affirmative" stance is frequently mistaken for a "feel-good" attitude with fuzzy new age connotations. It is anything but. This misapprehension, which is currently being widely embraced by "dark" philosophy currents, is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of Spinozist joy, as it is taken up by Deleuze. It cannot be repeated often enough that this idea of joy and sadness is not mappable onto the hedonic distinctions of pleasure-unpleasure, pleasure-pain. Again, this brings us back to the quantitative question. The hedonic distinctions carry an underlying quantitative bias. The attainment of  pleasure is understood in terms of satisfaction, and satisfaction is understood as the release of tension. Tension is thought to be physiologically measurable, often in a way that is tied to a biologistic, reductive notion of drives.
