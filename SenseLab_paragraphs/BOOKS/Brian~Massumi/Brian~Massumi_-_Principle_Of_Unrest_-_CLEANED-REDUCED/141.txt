If minor events are everywhere we look, then minor gestures can be also. They are always available to amplify the potential that the minor event imperceptibly expresses. Politics then, can be practiced everywhere, all the time, in whatever situations through which we live our lives, at school, at work, among friends and lovers, in the streets of the city. This is the idea of "micropolitics." For me, the concept of micropolitics is closely akin to the anarchist insistence that the politics practiced in the present should prefigure the relational field to come: that the job of political activism is to make the futurity in the present already actionable.
