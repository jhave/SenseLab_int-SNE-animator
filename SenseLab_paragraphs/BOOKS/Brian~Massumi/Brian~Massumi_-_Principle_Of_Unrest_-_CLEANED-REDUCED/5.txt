In the movement of relational transformation, the very definition of what moves changes. Identity is ceaselessly overcome in variation. Should we say, then, that the human has always been on the move throughout its history? Or is it more accurate to say that a movement of relational transformation has moved through the human? If so, when did that movement of relational transformation begin? It is clear that the "principle of unrest" predates the human – or rather this continuing process of hominization – and runs the full length of evolution, from the beginnings of life. From this perspective, the human is a carrier of a movement of relational transformation, one that swept it up, and  sweeps through it.
