This reinstalls us in bare activity, in a way that takes account more fully of the field. We are partially liberated from the perspective of the "I" that arose with the transmutation of the fullness of the causal situation into an erroneous objectification. A fuller field perception becomes available to our body. This field perception contains the original objectified perception as a perspective within it, supplemented by others. Instead of a simply located "I" before a simply located object, cause of our desire or pain, we have a differential mutual inclusion of perspectives, including that of things. In the mirror example, "I" was taken in by the mirror's perspective on the world. In one way or another, "I" is always included in a field of relation that is irreducible to its own perspective, that includes it in a larger field brimming with alien, non-I, even nonhuman, perspectives. "We" (our sensitive, thinking-feeling body) are always living larger than ourselves, even if unbeknownst to our "I," and more intensely (more fully potentialized). It is crucial to note that the regaining of the larger field has been achieved, not through any critical reflective consciousness, but through groping in error, knocking against the surface of the mirror â€“ against the clarity of conscious perception as it presents itself.
