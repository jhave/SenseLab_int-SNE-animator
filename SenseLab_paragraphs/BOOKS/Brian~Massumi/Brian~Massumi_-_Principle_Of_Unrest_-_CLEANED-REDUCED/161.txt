The way all of this comes back to the question of the endocolonization of potential and the possibility of making qualitative distinctions that break the symmetry between dominant power and resistance to it, centers on the tautology of the could-have/would have and its paradoxical power to make wrong into a priori right. The making of wrong into right is an operation of legitimation. Preemptive power operationalizes threat in a way that is self-legitimizing, independent of rational argument. As a result, it can be used to legitimate the people and collective apparatuses that wield it by purely affective means.
