BM: Well, I agree that capitalism is unbounded and there is no getting outside of it, and that it is universal in that sense, but when I say that I mean it very differently, in a way that doesn't entail the conclusion that everything we do is "in" it. The logical question is: How can you say that a space without boundaries is an interiority? Is not a space without boundaries rather a field of exteriority? A great outside: an expanded field. If the capitalism's field of operation is a field of exteriority, then we have to invert the question. Given that everything is afoot in a great outside, under what circumstances can we say that anything is inside? Deleuze and Guattari answer: when mechanisms deploy themselves to contain it. When it is captured by a system or structure and folded into it, incorporated into it. The capitalist field is full of what Deleuze and Guattari call "apparatuses of capture"(1987: 424-473). There are prisons, schools, legal systems, bureaucracies, political parties, corporations, nongovernmental organizations, all manner of institutions and quasi-institutions. Each sets its own operative boundaries in order to set itself apart. The setting-apart allows for an internal logic proper to that domain to hold sway inside the boundaries of that territory.
