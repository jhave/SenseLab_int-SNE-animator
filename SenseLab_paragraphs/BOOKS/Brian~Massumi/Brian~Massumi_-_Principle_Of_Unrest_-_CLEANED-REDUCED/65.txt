BM: The idea is that complicity is of the nature of things. The idea that everything is included in the capitalist field to a certain degree and that there are degress of inclusion rather than a simple inside and outside, makes it possible, and necessary, to work with this complicity rather than simply moralizing about it. Work with it – or better, play it. Play with it. Play on it. Game it. Processual duplicity is an ontopowerful tool. It is not the same as dishonesty: it is the fuzzy-set capacity of the dividual to truly belong to two sets at the same time, but not in like manner, rather with simultaneous divergent tendencies in co-operation. The practice of processual duplicity is a way, limited by necessity it is true, of prolonging the "schizzing" of bare activity into the institutional landscape – a way of keeping a hold on potential, of continuing to be on the move with a quantum of becoming.
