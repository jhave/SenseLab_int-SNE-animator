None of the elements agitating in this infra-individual "crowd" of forming experience can be unambiguously categorized, he says, as falling on the side of willing or thinking. They are integrally both. In other words, they are tendencies (even the most bodily, apparently purely physiological, among them). Tendencies are of the nature of thinking because what they tend toward is not sensibly present. They are equally of the nature of willing because they are preferentially oriented and are self-executing. Nietzsche underlines their durational nature. Each enfolds, from its particular angle, a feeling of the process under way: a feeling, he says, of the state to leave, the state to be reached, the feeling of this leaving-and-reaching itself, all bundled with many other things, notably the feeling of the muscles tensing for a coming movement, a feeling of the quality of the movement before it comes: an abstract feeling of the movement, without the actual movement â€“ but with its affective force. All of this underlines the primacy of movement we were talking about earlier.
