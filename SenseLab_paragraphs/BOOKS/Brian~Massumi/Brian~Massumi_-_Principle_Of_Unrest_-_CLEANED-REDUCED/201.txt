BM: Yes, well I think it’s a very good example because Sehgal is very consciously playing on modes of complicity. And he’s often criticized for bringing relational or participatory art back into the gallery, and for selling the work. But he’s selling it in a different form. He forbids documentation, visual or auditory. What he sells is a set of instructions for remaking the event. So he’s playing on the immaterial products of the new capitalist order, finding a way to literally sell abstract germs of artistic events. I wouldn’t fault him a priori for choosing to work inside the gallery, and I don’t think complicity in itself is an adequate critique. The question is, given this choice of emplacement, and the patterns of complicity that come with it, is there something else that can be made to come to pass? Is there something different that is being made to happen that is not reducible to the complicity, but might in fact be enabled by it, and wouldn't come about without it? In addition to producing a monetary surplus-value for himself that allows him to keep his work going, is Sehgal in any sense creating surplus-values of life for the participants and/or for the performers? This Situation is one of those artworks that play on the conversational form, as we were talking about earlier. So returning to that discussion, the question for me is, does he make a semblance of it? Does he open the minimal difference of conversation to itself so as to make it an intense likeness of itself, foregrounding the thinking-feeling of what is happening as it happens? And does having the piece in the gallery enhance or dampen that gesture?
