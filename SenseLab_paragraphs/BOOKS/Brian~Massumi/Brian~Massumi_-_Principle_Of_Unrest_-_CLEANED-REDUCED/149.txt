This illocutionary force of a programmatic utterance is what Deleuze and Guattari call the "order-word" (1987: 75-110). A recent example that stands out is the Occupy Wall Street order-word of the "one percent." It was centrally issued by Adbusters but, against all expectations, opened onto the assembly-form of attempted direct democracy and its swarm of expressive agitations, with just as unexpected powers of contagion. What is needed is an ecology of qualitatively different, but correlated, agitations operating in both dimensions at once, micro- and macro, playing minor gestures and order-words, in alternation and concertation.
 
KW: You have been using some of the same vocabulary to describe counter-ontopower as you do to talk about the ontopower it opposes. For example potential, and the idea of making the future actionable in the present. One of the ways you talk about ontopower accessing the future in the present is through the notion of double-conditional, the "could have .. would have." How does that work, and how is it different from how counter-ontopowers work with futurity?
