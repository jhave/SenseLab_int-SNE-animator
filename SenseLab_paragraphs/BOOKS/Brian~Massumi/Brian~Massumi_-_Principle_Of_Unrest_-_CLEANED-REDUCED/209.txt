AH: Many of the examples of semblance phenomena and vitality affects we have been discussing have a movement content: the mouse that runs at the edge of perception whose trajectory you feel, the dog whose bark arrives before it arrives, and the crashing vehicle, which carries a very paradoxical temporality, at once too fast and too slow. So: a little constellation of relations between the human-animal, the animal and the machine. Thinking about the relationship between movement and politics: we are the animals that have a very particular historical imperative in relation to movement. As modern subjects we are supposed to move, to use our tools and machines to eliminate the limitations of movement, to keep moving. Movement is not neutral or benign, but pre-conditioned by powers. Part of the consequence of that movement imperative politically is not very good, let’s say for instance, ecologically in terms of these relations between human-animals and other animals, between humans and the planet. I’m wondering whether in relationship to politics, or to aesthetics, what’s actually really imperative is to find forms of movement that are self-questioning, or self-annulling; that it is movement itself that must be interrogated as a prior organizing condition of subjectivity.
