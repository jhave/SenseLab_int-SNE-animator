This is a much larger question than debunking "illusions" or communicating a correct analysis of the complexity of the situation, because there is always that affective element. Affective modulation must be met with affective modulation. Reason, as Hume argued, gives none: alone, it is impotent to motivate action. It cannot give a reason for itself. There is no a priori reason why being reasonable is "better" – unless it is felt to be. The force of reason is found in affect. In addition to giving all the reasons why, for example, the fear of immigrants is unreasonable, the fear of the stranger must be fought on the same affective register as it is produced, but in a different tonality. A politics of care must be made as compelling as the appearance of existential threat. Transindividual sympathy – sympathy operating in radical affective proximity-at-a-distance, across lines of identity – must be mobilized, not as a personal act, not as a moral act, but as a directly political, that is to say, transindividual, act. The shock-effect, the immediation-effect, of "real-time" processing and the agitation/activation it produces could provide as fertile ground for this alternative politics as it does for right-wing politics, if only it is attuned to a different affective tonality, within a different horizon than that of existential threat – namely, the horizon of intensities of life that arise through the collective interplay of differences.
