As Foucault made abundantly clear in Discipline and Punish (1977), the carceral system actually produces more of the criminality that it is its stated objective to stamp out, rather than effectively normalizing the population as it ostensibly purports to do. In my work on preemption, I assert that this positive production of what is supposed to be negated is a characteristic of all preemptive mechanisms of power. This aspect of the disciplinary institution prefigures ontopower, whose power to bring to be, I argue, revolves around preemption. But the main point for the moment is that the for-profit prison, as disciplinary institution, has its own logic, which is not reducible to the capitalist relation without remainder, and that it also feeds off modes of relation that are likewise irreducible to the capitalist without remainder. In this case, what is fed upon is criminality, of which the prison's dedicated institutional logic of carcerality is a function. Of course, much criminal activity is conducted for profit, and criminal organizations have a kind of entrepreneurial spirit. But not all crimes are for profit. The spectrum of criminality extends into other territories (in particular, territories of passion). The equation between criminality, carcerality, and capitalism is far from perfect. There is co-functioning, but there are also areas of disjunction and relative autonomy. The more useful model, again, is symbiosis, rather than hegemony, if hegemony is understood to imply a single dominant structure sucking everything in without remainder and making everything homogeneous (or at least homologous). Symbiosis, but also parasitism.
