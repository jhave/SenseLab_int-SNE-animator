BM: No. They are concerned with self-valorization. They don't try to be right when they're wrong, they try to supplement the necessity of error. They also target perception at the constitutive level at which it is just forming, but they do so in a way oriented toward resituating the constitutional error of experience in an expanded field where it takes on qualitative "added-value" as a relational surplus-value of life that makes the event worth living for its own intensity â€“ where, instead of being right, it becomes beautiful. They also operate in an affective register. Counter-ontopower's affective orientation toward the generation of alter-surplus-values it by nature anti-capitalist and anti-militaristic. Dominant ontopower power leverages threat in a way that feeds the capitalist machinery with which the military apparatus is in symbiosis. It also produces a surplus-value of perception, in the form of a productively preempted threat.
