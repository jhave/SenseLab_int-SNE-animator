AH: When we encountered the dog earlier, you talked of the phenomena of the dog arriving before they arrived. You gave the dog bark a particular temporal dynamic as a phenomenon. My sense is that this term "semblance" is really important for you in relation to this kind of occurrence. I take it immediately when one says something like "semblance" that it is distinguished from resemblance, and from representation. It is already something that is less than, or even more than that. I also understand from what you are saying that a semblance is something informed by the co-constitution of the senses â€¦
