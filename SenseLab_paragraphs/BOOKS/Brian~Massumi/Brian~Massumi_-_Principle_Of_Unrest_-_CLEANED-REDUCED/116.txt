BM: There are relationally intensifying tendencies that are just as strong. These counter-tendencies have to do with play and inventive improvisation (at least in my neo-Spinozist version, if not in Spinoza himself). It is through play and improvisation that adequate ideas may be arrived at â€“ at the ulterior limit of survival. Not against it, but out the far side of its objectifying movement, in a return of perception to the more integral relational field of feeling from which it separated itself out in the object-form. Adequate ideas, for me, are feelings of potential. Since potential is their "object" and potential has as yet no particular actual shape, they are by nature abstract in a way that is not objectifiable in perception.
