BM: That really goes to the crux of why I started working on the concept of ontopower, in the aftermath of 9/11. It seemed to me that the kind of vocabulary that had been used by the revolutionary left since May '68 could just as easily be applied to the dominant regime of power that I felt was consolidating itself in the post 9/11 period, and was already prominent in the management and business strategy vocabulary of the hypercapitalists of the 1990s. But part of me felt that even within this convergence, there was a qualitative distinction to be made, between ontopower as the new dominant and counter-ontopowers. It is the way in which the future is made actionable in the present, the mode of potentialization, that makes the difference. When I use the phrase counter-ontopower, I don't mean that they are the opposite of ontopower, but rather that the are ontopowers that run counter to the dominant mode.
