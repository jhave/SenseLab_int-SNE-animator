To a certain extent, this dovetails with the discourse of what has come to be known as accelerationism. But we have be to careful. It is necessary to work through the issues guided by an understanding of movement as qualitative transformation. The premise of accelerationism is that capitalism's natural tendency is to speed things up. Since the mobilization of capital is now ubiquitous, the only way out is to encourage it to speed up its own speeding up ever more. In catastrophist versions, the acceleration will reach a point where the capitalist economy can no longer catch its own tail in surplus-value of flow, and it falls in a heap â€“ the crisis to end all capitalist crises. All of this is couched in quantitative terms of speed.
