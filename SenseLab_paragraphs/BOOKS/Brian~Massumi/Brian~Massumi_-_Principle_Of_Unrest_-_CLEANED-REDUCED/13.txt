The epitome of surplus-value of flow is the way the financial markets operate. At that level, surplus-value is produced by leveraging movements of capital, by gaming turnover, by playing the timing of transactions, by second-guessing the trends, without even the need for a concretized product to emerge, but rather purely through abstract, second-order products like derivatives and credit default swaps. It is toward this short-circuiting of production that the center of gravity of the economy has moved, as if in search of a soul: the spirit of capitalism endeavoring to free itself from the body of production. Capital, self-abstracting. The value of the financial sector in the developed economies is now many times greater than the manufacturing sector. Even if the self-abstracting can never be complete, and the articulation of the financial markets to the so-called "real" economy cannot be eliminated, it is highly significant that the balance has shifted and that the effort of capital to levitate itself from the sphere of concrete production has taken on the piloting role.
