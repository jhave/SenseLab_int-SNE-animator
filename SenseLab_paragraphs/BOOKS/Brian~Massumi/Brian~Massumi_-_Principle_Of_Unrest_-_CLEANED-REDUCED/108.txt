An inadequate idea for Spinoza consists in identifying an external object as the linear cause of a pain, a distress, or a wrong. These "sad" affects are always relational in their genesis, since they arise from encounters. Every encounter is an affective complex: a patterning of capacities to affect and to be affected. This is not a dualism, but a relational matrix, because both capacities are found on both sides of the encounter. Peirce makes this point: there is no such thing as the passively undergoing a force, because even resistance or friction, even shrinking back, constitutes a capacity to counter-affect: they can modulate the application of force, or its follow up. There is no active-passive dichotomy, only affective fields of intermodulation. It is totally understandable, however, that the pain be plotted to an external object. In fact, it is a necessity of survival. The object is the perceptible sign of what is stirring in the relational field – many of whose dimensions do not appear by nature. Among the many things that are active but do not appear as such are tendencies and habits of counter-affection that self-execute nonconsciously. The object is the visible index of the expanded relational field, including what plies it but does not appear in it. Pinning reactions on the appearance of the object is an indirect way of addressing what does not appear – the tendencies and counter-affections that may express next, and impinge on the life of the body. It is a necessary survival strategy, enabling avoidance, or a choice as to the conditions of an encounter. The object's presence visibly indexes logical nextness – what can be anticipated based on past encounters and the regularities they presented.
