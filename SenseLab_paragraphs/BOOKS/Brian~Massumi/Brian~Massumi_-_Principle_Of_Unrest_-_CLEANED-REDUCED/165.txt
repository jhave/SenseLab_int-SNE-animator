Counter-ontopowers' affirmation of values other than capitalist surplus-value puts them at loggerheads with the capitalist process, in consonance with non-capitalist modes of relation ungoverned by the logic of capital. As these movements self-affirm, and push toward their mode of relation's ulterior limit, they are in the same movement pushing toward the ulterior limit of capitalism. They must do this in a non-militarisic way, or they will get ugly. When discord plays out in such a way that emergent tendencies oppose and curtail each other, when the tendency of tendencies is to construe their own self-accomplishment as hinging on the annihilation of the others, then the "beauty" of radical differential-mutual-inclusion becomes impossible.
This, unfortunately, is the direction things seem to be heading in today, under the sway of identitarian becomings-reactive butting heads with each other.
