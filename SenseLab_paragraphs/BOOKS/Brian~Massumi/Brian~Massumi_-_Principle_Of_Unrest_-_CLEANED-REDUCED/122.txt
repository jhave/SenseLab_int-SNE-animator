The objective illusion is ultimately that potential can be sundered from the body, that a body can be separated from what it can do. But reactivity does just that: it enacts the illusion. It does the impossible: curtail life's tendency to affirm and expand its powers to be, which are one with its powers to act (which move its becoming). As an aside, Agamben's concept of bare life, with its evocation of the abject body relegated to absolute impotence, is complicit with this operation. An account of the political as founded on bare life stages a becoming-reactive of the very grounds of political thought, suspending the political in the separating of a body from what it can do affirmatively.
