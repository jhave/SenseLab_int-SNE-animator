BM: As a preliminary to that question, it is important to think very hard about the historical conjuncture we have arrived at. If a vector of becoming has swept through and come out the far side of the human adventure in the form of the neoliberal-capitalist machinery of ontopower, then the label of the Anthropocene to designate the age we we are entering is off the mark. I find Jason W. Moore's term the "Capitalocene" (Moore 2015) a much better starting point, because this is the age in which the movement of the capitalist process through the human outstrips "man," precisely by making the effects of "his" activity ubiquitous, in ever more complicated feedback effects between levels that escape his control, to the ultimate detriment of his own life environment and, potentially, his very survival.
