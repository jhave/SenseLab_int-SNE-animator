Brian Massumi: The world has always been in movement. The study of human prehistory is currently being rewritten in light of new realizations about the rapidity of the movements that brought our ancestors out of Africa and across Europe and Asia, and about the complexity of the migrations, which, it is now realized, included movements of return among all three continents. There is movement everywhere, from as far back as we can see, and nowhere is it linear. There is a restlessness in human history that constantly tangles the lines, so much so as to call into the question the integrity of the species. Interbreeding between modern humans and other human species, Neanderthals, Denisovans, and at least one other whose existence is at only hinted at, has contributed to our genome, and that contribution is now being tied to specific physiological and phenotypic characteristics of human populations.
