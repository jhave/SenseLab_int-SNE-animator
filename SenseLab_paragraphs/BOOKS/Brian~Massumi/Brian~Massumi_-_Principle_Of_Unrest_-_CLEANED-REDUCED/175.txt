In the first instance, this way of doing things separates a mode of activity from others. When philosophy runs away with itself, takes itself to its own limit, and truly creates concepts, one thing that is guaranteed to happen is that its thinking will outrun utility. It will be tapping experimentally into the futurity in the present, it will be bringing to expression powers of thought that are just dawning. The context is not quite ready for them. They lack a proper context. The concepts will be breaking new territory, and function and utility will have to catch up, new ones will have to be invented, for which new contexts will emerge. Intensely coherent uselessneess is a symptom of philosophy's success.
