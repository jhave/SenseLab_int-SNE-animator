Once again, Peirce models his pragmatic account of signs and the thought-expression on the verb. As the model verb, he chooses "expresses." "Expresses" is a very special verb. At the same time as it expresses something, he says, it "expresses its expressing something" (Peirce 1998: 408). It is self-reporting. But just as the oneness of a verb like "gives" envelops a some, a manyness of roles and potential objects, "expresses" envelops many a verb. In fact, it wraps itself up in all of them, and swaddles them all. For is not "expresses" of the nature of all verbs? Of all signs? Is "expresses" not the natural environment of signs? Do they not, each and every one, have an expressive dimension of self-reporting to them? Is it not through the pressure of the self-reporting of their standing-for that the form-of-fact of their situation comes Objectively to express itself through the would-bes and collateral action with which it pragmatically supplements the sign?
