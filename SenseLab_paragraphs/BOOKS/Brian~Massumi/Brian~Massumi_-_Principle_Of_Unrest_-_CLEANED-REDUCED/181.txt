A common misconception about this kind of event- or process-oriented philosophy is that it's a philosophy of pure flow or pure continuity. This is a tenacious misunderstanding of thinkers like Bergson, Whitehead, and Deleuze and Guattari, which has always surprised me. Because you just have to read one page of a book like Deleuze and Guattari's Anti-Oedipus to see that they make the cut as primoridial as the continuity (1983). In a process, it's not continuity or rupture, it's always both. For example when the dog interrupted us, he’d taken a big breath, he’d braced himself for us going by, he was ready for us. Then he let go, and the bark that emerged had an arc to it. It had an internal rhythm, it was pulsed, it was composed of mini-events of variation of tone and loudness. But the mini-events folded into each other to compose a bark, with an overall affect: surprise. That affect was also an immediate effect: it gave us pause. It cut into our conversation, it produced a rupture in it. The bark was a single event for our conversation, even though it was composed of any number of mini-events. It figured in our conversation as a continuity: one bark, rolling across its pulses. It presented itself with a dynamic unity of unfolding that cut it off on the one hand from the continuity of the ambient background sound, and on the other made it cut into the continuity of our conversation: cut and continuity.
