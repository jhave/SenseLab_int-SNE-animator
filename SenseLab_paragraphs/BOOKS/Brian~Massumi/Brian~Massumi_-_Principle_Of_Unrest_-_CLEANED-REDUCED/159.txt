A threat is different from a danger. It is effectively menacing the moment it is felt as a threat, even if it isn't effectively present. Threat does make itself present, but not in the form of a clear-and-present danger, rather in the form of fear. Fear is the presence of the futurity of threat. Threat, as it presents itself, is a creature of affect. "Reality-based" deliberation has to yield to the affective facts, and the affective facts always indicate preemptive action â€“ if we are to feel secure.
