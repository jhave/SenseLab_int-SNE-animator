BM: This is another prong of the question of quantification, and the difficulty of approaching current cultural and political issues without a thorough calling into question of the tendency to give quantitative notions the last word. The notion of real-time is a chronological notion. It refers to the speed of a transmission through space, increasing in measure toward the ideal point where the thickness of space is overcome, where the drag and delay it represents disappears. This overcoming of space is a fiction. There is no such thing as simultaneity. The idea of attaining it treats space and time as though they could be separated out as independent variables. But there is not a spatial frame on the one hand, and a time-line on the other. Time and space always come together. They come integrally, as a block. There are only space-times â€“ durations. The world is made of duration. Divide an occurrence as far as you can, and what you get is only smaller and smaller patches of space-time, little smudges of duration.
