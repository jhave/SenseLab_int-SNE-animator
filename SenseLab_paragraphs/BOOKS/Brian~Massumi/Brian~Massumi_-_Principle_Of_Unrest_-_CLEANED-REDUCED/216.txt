BM: Yeah… the concept of intuition comes up for me because of my particular background, coming out of Bergson. Bergson defines intuition as the "lowering of the barriers of space" in such a way that we’re "transported into the heart of the object" in a condition of absolute "sympathy" with it  (Bergson 1998: 177; translation modified). For that to work for me, given my process philosophy bias, I need to strike "object" and replace it with "event." And I need to rethink "sympathy" as something that is not in the interiority of a subject. Sympathy is rather "the relational activity constitutive of the event," the formative activity of the event's arising. The clichéd idea of intuition as a bolt of inspiration that hits the individual has nothing to do with it. Sympathy in the sense I was just talking about is collective – or better, transindividual, to use Simondon's term. So if the barriers of space lower in relation to the formative activity of an event, what that means is that you have a direct prehension (to avoid the term cognition) – an immediate, active grasp – of what may come of the event on all sides. You're not just thinking-feeling it from your point of view. Because you’re in the middle, where actions and formative factors are intersecting at the level of their tendencies. You're in the potential filling the gaps between the tendencies. There, you can't be in your subject position, because who or what you will be will play out of a function of how the intersecting tendencies shake down. You're not in your subject position, you're in becoming. Sympathy in this sense has nothing to do with the human emotion of empathy. It's not a human emotion. It's a state of the world, at a point of rupture or discontinuity – when the dust settles, things will be different. Sympathy is the immediate embodied enactive understanding of the potentials coming out of that field of relation, from the angle of this differencing.
