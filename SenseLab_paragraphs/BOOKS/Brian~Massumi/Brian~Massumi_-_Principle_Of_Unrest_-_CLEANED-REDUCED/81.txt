Earlier, I talked about how the crowdsourcing and data-mining of people's network-enabled movements generate a "surplus-value of flow" in the form of monetizable information. This is the generation of capital out of information, purely as a function of the flow of information. This occurs with little or no labor input â€“ certainly none commensurate with returns. It is an achievement of the algorithmic. You could also cite style scouting in the urban environment, where capital is extracted from variations in style, from the flow of modes of life signalling their difference in relation to one another. The "work" is performed as part of the collective composition of a form of life. This is not labor, but self-affirming, self-inventing activity that is undertaken for its own experienced value.
