KW: If the figure of the citizen is somehow suspended in capitalsm, what does that imply for models of democracy?
 
BM: There is a fundamental misfit between the multi-scale regime of ontopower I just described and liberal democracy. Liberal democracy is ostensibly predicated on the personal sanctity of the individual subject of right, the citizen safely enwrapped within the sovereign sanctity of the individual state. Liberal democracy only knows how to work across those two scales of individuality, the fully formed citizen and the sovereign state (neither of which is what it purports to be any longer). Its bridging strategy is the mechanism of representation. It is this mechanism that has broken down.
