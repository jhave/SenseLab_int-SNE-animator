The push toward real-time does enable the flow of images and information to accelerate and circulate farther, faster, through more meanderings, to the point that the force of its anchoring in its space of departure, the trace of its element of spacing, becomes attenuated. As you say, this rebounds on perceptions of the movements of objects and people whose durations are very different to the speed of circulation. The duration of an image's appearance in and passage through the media networks takes the fore, so that it appears as if things, like flows of refugees, have appeared in "real-time" out of nowhere. This has tremendous affective effects. Everything comes as a shock, creating a perpetual state of agitation, of activation, that easily tips over into fear. More and more images begin to prime for fear. It is an odd fact of the affective constitution of human perception – at least present-day networked human perception – that words and images that prime for fear produce nonconscious associations with death.
