BM: Precisely. Signs of threat are everywhere, arriving as out of nowhere at the "real-time" speed of the networked media. The reactive response to this always overreaches its target, because what is being reacted to are generalized signs of the object's class or category, irrespective of individual characteristics or the singularity of situations. The response is always too "big," too generalized, not nuanced enough â€“ basically off-base. Again, this is not a personal error, and has nothing to do with stupidity in the usual sense of a lack of intelligence. It is a processual error, bearing on the way in which bodies are postured into the relational field, and what manner of potential they selectivly channel from it as a result. This channels potential limitatively, selecting on one side for reactions to threat, and the other hybris of the supposedly free agents.
