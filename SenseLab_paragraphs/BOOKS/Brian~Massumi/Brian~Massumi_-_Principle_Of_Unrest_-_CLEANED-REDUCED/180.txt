You can't start with the object as it's usually thought of, as a more or less inert lump of matter. You can't start from a concept of substance either, because a nexus of events has relation, it's a composition of movements, but there's nothing underlying them, they hold each other in place. Everything is in the way they come together and co-compose. There's no stuff. If you go down far enough, all you reach is the void, the restless energy field of the quantum void. You can't start with the subject either, because a nexus of events is in the world, not in an interiority. There is only one place to start, and that's with activity. You have to say that the only thing certain is that there is activity always going on, and that's what the world is made of. And when you say that, you've just added to the activity. Thought itself is an event. So start there, and take it to the limit.
