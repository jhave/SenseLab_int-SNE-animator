There isn't the time here to go into all the details, or even to all the problems we've been grappling with in envisioning an economic system without measure or exchange, based on qualitative abundance, qualitative excess-production. Suffice it to say that we're attempting to do is to hijack the cutting-edge tools of runaway speculative finance to create what is essentially a post-scarcity anarcho-communist micro-society, specific to a single DAO serving a particular collective project in a way that frees it from insitutional funding, and by doing that from all of the neoliberal strings that are increasingly attached to outside funding, whether it comes from private foundations or government sources. If it works, it could expand to include mutual aid systems to help members of the collective survive in the dominant economy. The need to buy food and pay rent will not be going away soon. The convertibility between the internal currency of the Adventure Capture DAO and fiat money is a complicity with the general capitalist economy â€“ but it is also the condition under which it can contrive a partial but effective freeing from it. The Economic Space Agency is also working with a number of other initiatives looking to develop collective economies based on notions of the common rather than private property, again taking advantage of the potentials created by the blockchain. Their aim is to prototype new economic platforms, to be made available on an open source basis. Ours is the most radical in terms of its attempt to imagine into being a non-exchange-based, purely qualitative, collectivist economy. We may not succeed. It may prove impossible. But even it does ultimately fail, it has already taken our collective along a germinal line of escape.
