BM: Yes. In the form of derivatives called collateralized debt obligations, debts like home mortgages are bundled together and sold as an investment package mixing high- and low-risk debts. This "tranching" is meant to "securitize" the overall product. If the debts composing any particular tranche defaults, the effect of that breakdown is watered down and the overall value is safeguarded. The underlying "assets" (i.e., debts) can be packaged into more than one product: the debt packages can be sold on to other investors, wholly or in part. This multiplies and divides the assets at the same time: it fractalizes them. The complexity can get to the point where who owns what can be impossible to ascertain. The debt then becomes uncollectable. This was one of the contributing factors behind the 2008 financial crisis in the US. In some cases, ownership became indeterminate by dint of an excess of it. Property was threatened by over-ownership. Capitalism's in-built tendency toward excess can be its own worse enemy, leading it to the point where it calls its own systemic requisites into question, in this case property itself.
