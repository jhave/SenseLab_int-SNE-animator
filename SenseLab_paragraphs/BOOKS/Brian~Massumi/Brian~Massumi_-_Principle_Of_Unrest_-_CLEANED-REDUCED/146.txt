This requires the processual concern and sympathy I spoke of earlier. That this is practiced in the horizon of becoming-other, rather than in the name of identity, in defense of the self-same, makes all the difference. It potentially erases the paranoia of the other that makes co-patterning impossible. It enables a becoming-active of everybody, against the separative becomings-reactive we all know too well. If this sounds utopic, it isn't. It is just always-as-yet unknowable (but already coming to be actionable, wherever a minor gesture cares to go). It is important to note that the co-patterning at issue is aesthetic. It is at the core of Whitehead's theory of beauty. Beauty, for Whitehead, is not reducible to harmony. It requires an affirmation of discord, a co-operation of incommensurable movements each affirming itself, but in resonance with others.
