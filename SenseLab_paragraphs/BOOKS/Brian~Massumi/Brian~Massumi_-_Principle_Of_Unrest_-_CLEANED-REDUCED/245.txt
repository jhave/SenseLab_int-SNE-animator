Peirce's emphasis on finitude when talking about the self-propagating power of thought, apparently limitless in its autonomous cross-power to relay itself, seems paradoxical at first sight. But it makes perfect sense if you consider that if there were an infinite series of utterers and interpreters, there will always be an interpreter downstream of every utterer, and an utterer upstream of every interpreter. Expression still hinges on the individual, at each successive utterance. All along the beginningless and endless line, the movement of thought remains a dual affair between individual utterers and interpreters. Rather than opening expression, this in fact only closes it down all the more exhaustively by infinitizing the centrality of the individual subject. Expression is endlessly imprisoned in the interiority of the speaking subject. If, on the other hand, the collection of utterers and interpreters is finite, then there are loose ends. There is a cut-off point where an utterer's enunciation fails to find an interpreter and falls into the gaps â€“ which is the same thing as an interpretation remaining in potential with no one yet to pass it down the line. Cesura. "If a sign has no interpreter, its interpretant is a 'would be', i.e. it is what would determine the interpreter if there was one" (Peirce 1998: 409). A would-be determination of an interpreter: a potential expression. In-forming. The opening of expressive potential is predicated on the finitude of the collection of utterers. Expression is no longer a dual affair. It is opened to a "Thirdness," and the third is potential.
