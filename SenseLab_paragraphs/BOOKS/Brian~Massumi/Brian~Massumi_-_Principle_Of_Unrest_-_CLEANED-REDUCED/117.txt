Perception is a form of lived abstraction, to the extent that it indexes nextness: what is not present, but may be expected to come. But adequate ideas are yet more abstract, in a way that is directly, bodily felt, immanent to perception, and felt as an opening for acting otherwise, resonant with the full complexity of the relational field. They are a mode of lived abstraction that I call "thinking-feeling." Thinking-feeling occurs immanently to perception, flush with bare activity. This is the realm of Bergson's intuition and Peirce's abduction.
