The moral category of culprit, of a guilty party, is for Nietzsche more fundamental than the category of efficient cause, which is a generalizating abstraction that works to neutralize the odor of moral judgment that comes with ressentiment. With the perception of the guilty party, or more generally the object, an "I" posits itself as an opposing unity. The "I" overlooks the crowd from whose collective willing-feeling it arose. The "I" takes credit for the issuing action. It arrogates the formative activity to itself. It puffs itself up with the affective force of the self-executing movements over which it claims possession. It circles the wagons of its arrogance around the feelings it purports to unify, construing them as arising from the depths of an interiority all its own, rather than from the playing out of a relational-transformational field of unbounded exteriority. Identity is built on this necessary error, incumbent in the genesis of perception. "I" is constitutively stupid.
