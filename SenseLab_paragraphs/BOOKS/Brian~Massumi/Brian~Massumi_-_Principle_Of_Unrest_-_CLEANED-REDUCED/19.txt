This level is stirring with micromovements. I call these formative, but not yet fully formed movements "bare activity." With respect to the infra-human, these are ebbs and flows of desire, tendency, fear, hope, self-interest, sympathy, tensings for action and easings into relation. It is as easy as click-bait to modulate that ebb and flow in order to orient its taking-determinate-form. Facebook demonstrated this with its infamous informal experiment in modulating people's moods and online behavior by modulating the affective tenor of their Facebook feeds. Capitalism has learned to descend to the infra-level where the individual is emergently divided among potential inflections of its own self-formative movements. Deleuze coined a word for the neoliberal subject, taking this self-dividing, this "schizzing," into account: the "dividual" (Deleuze 1995).
My hypothesis is that neoliberal capitalism directly couples this infra-individual level with the transindividual level. It energizes itself with feedback effects between the infra- and transindividual levels in a way that largely bypasses the intermediate level of the supposedly self-contained individual. This intermediate level is that of the social or moral person: the figure of the citizen, as subject of right, and the subject of rational interest. This level of the person, at which we like to think we function, is reduced to a hinge mechanism through which the infra- and the trans- commmunicate: a miniaturized "model of realization" of global capital, zoomed down to fit the contours of the human body (or rather, the pattern of  whole-body movements indexing the flow of a quantum of human-capital becoming). The transindividual level is, at its widest horizon, the integrated worldwide network of qualitatively transformational movements whose complexity and contingency escapes not only individual human control, but mastery by any individual nation-state.
