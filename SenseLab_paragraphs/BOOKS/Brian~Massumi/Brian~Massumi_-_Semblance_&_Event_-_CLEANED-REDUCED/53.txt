As a limit-concept, the virtual cannot be thought without paradox—and without working to make the paradox conceptually productive. There are a number of key junctures at which activist philosophy, like any metaphysics, must affirmatively make do with paradox. This is an essential moment in a philosophy’s self-formation. It is the moment a philosophical thought process verges upon the limit of what it can think. To make that limitexperience productive, the thinking must then turn back before it breaks apart like a spaceship entering a black hole. It must inscribe that self-saving inflection in itself, in the form of new concepts or new variations on old concepts. This must be done in a way that does not try to resolve or dismiss the paradox. It is done by taking the paradox seriously as a limit, turning back from it, and taking the necessity of turning back constructively to heart. The limit-experience of paradox turns around into an impulse for continuing the philosophy’s self-creative advance. It has been taken-in as a self-modulation of the thinking-process. It is no longer worried over as a logical contradiction. It has been actively converted into a creative factor that is liminally immanent to the process. It has become a positive factor. This affirmation of noncontradiction as a self-formative necessity is an essential feature of a creative philosophy’s signature activity.
