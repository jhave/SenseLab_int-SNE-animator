In general, composing-away involves taking a particular technique of existence to its highest degree of abstractive intensity, making it as absolutely felt as it can experienceably be, given the conditions (individual, social, culture, economic, technological). There are always buds of content that sprout from within. Techniques for composing-away must negotiate these shoots in one manner or another. Mahler’s technique of encouraging a certain modality of content growth, while simultaneously stymieing it by rendering it excessively non-specific, is a way of negotiating the problem of the eternal return of content by selectively embracing a certain order of content-readiness from the start, and then ensuring that it is not an extraelement but rather an element of an excess of immanence. When attempts are made to compose-away all trace of content-readiness from the get go, the growth returns at some point later in the process, often with a vengeance. The return may well take the form of an insurgency of another modality of experience bursting forth from within at the very moment the process of expression reaches its highest intensity and achieves the purest appearance of nonsensuous similarity. Lived abstraction is always ontogenetically multiple—as a function of its purity, if not countercurrent to it.
