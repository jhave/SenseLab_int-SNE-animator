This might sound lonely. It is certainly not touchy-feely. But Whitehead affirms it as a necessary condition for creativity. The nonrelation of relation is what makes “elbow room” in the world for an experience to come absolutely into its own production of novelty, uncramped by the constraint of connectively fitting in (Whitehead 1967a, 195). This preserves the emergence of novelty, rather than conformity to the present, as the principle of activity. It also makes all the world expressive. Purely self-expressive. It means the world of change is made of self-creative expression. This has obvious advantages for an aesthetico-political activist philosophy oriented toward a creative autonomy of forms of life.
