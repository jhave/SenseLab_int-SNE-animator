Surfaced, continuity is on either side of a divide. It bifurcates into a perceptual contrast between co-present and disjunct elements. A “co-presence of disjunct elements”: the definition of space. The “integral synchrony” of  mutually enfolded  before-afters has  been supplemented  by something planely spatialized. A spatiality is emerging from its own potential time-likeness. It has unfolded as an after, its before almost left behind. Continuity is no longer entirely in self-continuity. It is divided, supplementarily, into a double difference-from: direct contrast, spatial and temporal.
