If I am guilty of romanticizing anything, it would be intensity. By intensity I mean the immanent affirmation of a process, in its own terms. This is not a stated affirmation. It’s an activity. It’s when a process tends to the limit of what only it can do, and in that act resonantly embraces its own range of variation. It’s not mystical to call that self-affirming “life.” If you like Latin, you can join Spinoza and call it conatus. You can call it many names. The important thing once again is that in each instance you ask and answer “how.” Then it becomes a technical question of ontogenesis, or of the self-production of being in becoming.
