“‘Creativity’ is the principle of novelty” (Whitehead 1978, 21). To be at all is to become, actively creative. “Process for its intelligibility involves the notion of a creative activity belonging to the very essence of the occasion.” The transformation of the potential into the actual is a “process of self-creation.” “Such transformation includes the immediacy of selfenjoyment” (Whitehead 1968, 151).
