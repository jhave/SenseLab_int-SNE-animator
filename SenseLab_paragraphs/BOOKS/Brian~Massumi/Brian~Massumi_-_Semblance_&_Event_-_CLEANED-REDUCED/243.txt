The space of comparison is a normative space of ideal Thirdness rising above. What goes up, can come down. Instead of an oval, draw a cube. Project it onto a ground-level chaos. A razed plot of urban land, say. Think of its form as an abstract sieve to filter the chaos. Then concretize the form. Build a building according to its standard. The standard of comparison has now returned to earth, as a constructive model. It has gone actively to ground. A plot-size of selected abstract potential has been poured in concrete. Now it is a concrete ground for moving through and around. What ambient arrays, what edgings in, what potential crossings and connections, what glossings over, what identities and orderings will emerge from the movement it standardizes? An architect has modeled a building. The building itself now takes the baton, and models a plot-sized slice of life.
