All arts are occurrent arts. That’s another phrase from Susanne Langer (1953, 121). All arts are occurrent arts because any and every perception, artifactual or “natural,” is just that, an experiential event. It’s an event both in the sense that it is a happening, and in the sense that when it happens something new transpires. There is eventfulness in art, just as there is artfulness in nature. And there is creativity across the board. Because every event  is  utterly  singular,  a  one-off,  even  though  with  and  through  its one-offness a “likeness” is necessarily thought-felt to a whole population of other events with which it forms an endless series of repeated variations. Langer has probably gone further than any other aesthetic philosopher toward analyzing art-forms not as “media” but according to the type of experiential event they effect.
