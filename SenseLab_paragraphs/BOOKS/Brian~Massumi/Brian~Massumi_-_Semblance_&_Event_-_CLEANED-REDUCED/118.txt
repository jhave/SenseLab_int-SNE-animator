Interaction is just that: a going back and forth between actions, largely reduced to instrumental function. The lesson of the semblance is that lived reality of what is happening is so much more, qualitatively. It includes an “uncanny” moreness to life as an unfolding lived relation in a world whose every  moment  is  intensely  suffused  with  virtuality—an  abstractly  felt “backside,” or voluminousness, of life itself. When what is concentrated on are instrumentalized action-reaction circuits, what gets foregrounded is the element of nextness in the flow of action. The voluminousness of the experience, its all-aroundness and going-for-moreness, shrinks from feeling. That is why I make a distinction between interactivity and relation. I use the word interactivity to designate an instrumentally contracted dynamic form that tends to shrink to the parameters of its objectively embodied instrumental function. I use the word relation to refer to the full spectrum of vitality that the dynamic form really includes, potentially, abstractly self-expressed in its semblance. Interactivity backgrounds its own artistic dimension when it concentrates on the function of the instrument to the detriment of the semblant expression. That’s what has happened when we hear the comment, all too common, from interactive art participants that the experience felt like a video game. You often feel there’s a trick you need to find and master, and once you’ve done that, you lose interest because you’ve got the feel of it and know how it “works.” When something loses intensity instead of becoming more compelling when you get the feel of it, it is a sure sign that it is operating more on a level of predefined objective function than fully lived relation.
