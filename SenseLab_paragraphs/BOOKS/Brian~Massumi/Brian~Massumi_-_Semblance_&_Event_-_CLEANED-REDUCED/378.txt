It was the force of the blow that was audiovisually perceptually-felt in vision, as the cinematic event. The sound occurred with synchretized cinematic force. “Pure” dance likewise converts extra-dance factors into dance forces. This is done in different manners by different choreographic practices, in more or less rarefied ways, with or without this process becoming conscious in the usual sense (it is always thought-felt as the quality of the dance). Extra-dance factors become-dance, as dance becomes what it does, in a next eventful expression of how it makes itself felt for what it can do most purely.
