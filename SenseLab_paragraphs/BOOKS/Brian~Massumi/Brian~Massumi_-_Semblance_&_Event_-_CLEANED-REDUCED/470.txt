Benjamin’s theory of the semblance, from which the present essay took off many unfolded phases ago, is quite conscious of the traditional equation in the history of aesthetic theory between beauty and semblance, and between beauty and truth. He accepts the “famous tenet that beauty is semblance” (Benjamin 2002, 137). He even accepts that semblance is inseparable from truth (Benjamin 1996c, 224). But not, of course, without discomfort. For a beautiful thing has “semblance because it is alive in one sense or another” (1996c, 283; emphasis added). The problem is that there are devitalizing truths: the-truth truths.
