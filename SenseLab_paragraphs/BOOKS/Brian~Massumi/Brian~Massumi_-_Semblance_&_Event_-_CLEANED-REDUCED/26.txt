The way that activist philosophy affirms the subjective and objective as aspects of the process of change is to say that process exhibits a formative duplicity. This links the definition of objective and subjective to the relational-qualitative duplicity discussed earlier as co-composing dimensions of process. The distinction between separative/disjunctive and conjunctive/continuing aspects of process was another take on that duplicity of process, providing another angle of attack on the same problem. The subject/object distinction is yet another take on it.
