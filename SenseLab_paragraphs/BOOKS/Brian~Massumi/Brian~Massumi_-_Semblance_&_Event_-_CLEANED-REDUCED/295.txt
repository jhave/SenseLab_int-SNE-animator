Thought, taken up in language, raises the affective autonomy of the qualitative-relational order constitutive of forms of life to a higher power. Language is a labor-saving machine for accelerating and intensifying life activity, thought-skipping the “tardy consecutions” of sensuous perceptions. Language is a thought-machine for adding nonsensuous degrees of freedom to activity. It is a machine for remixing world-lines, skipping us down the lines and cross-jumping us from one line to another. This remix ability enlarges the parameters for the reindividuation of forms of life, beginning from the nonsensuous traces of the affective/qualitativerelational realm and moving back into the sensuous realm of actual action among sense-perceived objects.
