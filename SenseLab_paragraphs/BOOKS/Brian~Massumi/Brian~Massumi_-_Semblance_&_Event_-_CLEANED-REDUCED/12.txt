The simple gesture of starting again from the beginning—that is, in the midst—has led to a rapid cascade of concepts. From something doing to the bare fact of activity; from there to event and change; then on to potential and the production of the new; coming to process as becoming. Then, a major twist. The straight run encounters turbulence: process as becoming is not just creative activity, it turns out. It is self-creation. More than that, the self-creation is “enjoyed.” The principle of unrest eddies into something we would be forgiven for suspecting is not unlike an aesthetic appreciation: an enjoyment of creativity. How is this “at no remove”? How is this immediate? Doesn’t it imply self-reflection? Doesn’t self-reflection imply the luxury of the contemplative distance on the world? Isn’t that exactly what is excluded by the bare activist fact that we always find ourselves smack in the middle of its unrest? The paradox of an immediate “self-enjoyment” of experience, “belonging to the very essence” of its every occasion, is the complicating knot around which this approach to philosophy ties its concepts. It inscribes a certain duplicity into the very heart of its thinking and of the world.
