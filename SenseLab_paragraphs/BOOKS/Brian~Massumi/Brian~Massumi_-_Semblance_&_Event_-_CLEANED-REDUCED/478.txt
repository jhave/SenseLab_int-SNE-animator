The scale is the scale of aliveness: “In an artifact of beautiful semblance, the semblance is all the greater the more alive it seems.” Semblance and aliveness are indissociable. There is always “life quivering” in the event of the semblance. Bare activity (James 1996a, 160–162; Massumi 2009, 170– 173; Massumi 2010a). Pure activity of life, abstractly appearing with all the reality of an intensive event.
“Quivering life is never symbolic.” But it can be forcibly contained in harmony and its symbolic associations. When it is, the harmony “trembles” with life, but does not release it. It channels it toward the truth, to which it gives a sheen, a beautiful shimmer. Symbolism contains abstract life-intensity in the truth. It slides the artwork toward the deadening apolitical pole of the scale. Art, and life, must then be wrenched from that pole by “critical violence.”
