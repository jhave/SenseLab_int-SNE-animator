The trick to the productive speculative-pragmatic use of the concept of the virtual is never to separate it from the in-act. It takes a fair bit of conceptual calisthenics to achieve this, but it’s well worth the exercise. The key is always to hold to the virtual as a coincident dimension of every event’s occurrence. Again: don’t take this as a dichotomy but as a creative differential, one essentially ingredient to every experience to the extent that every experience is an occasion of lived abstraction.
