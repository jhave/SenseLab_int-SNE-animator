That’s why we see movement in a motif. The form naturally poises the body for a certain set of potentials. The design calls forth a certain vitality affect—the sense we would have, for example, of moving our eyes down a branch of rustling leaves, and following that movement with our hands. But that life dynamic comes without the potential for it to be actually lived. It’s the same lived relation as when we “actually” see leaves, it’s the same potential. But it’s purely potential. We can’t live it out. We can only live it in—in this form—implicitly. It’s like the motif has taken the abstraction that is the leaf and made it appear even more abstractly. So abstractly, it can’t go any further than this appearance. The body is capacitated, but the capacity has nowhere else to go. It’s in suspense. Langer calls this a “semblance” (1953, 45–68 and passim). The concept also appears in strikingly similar ways in Walter Benjamin’s early work on art and aliveness (Benjamin 1996b, 1996c).
