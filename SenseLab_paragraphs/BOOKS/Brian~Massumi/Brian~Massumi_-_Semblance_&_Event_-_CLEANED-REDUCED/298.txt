As taken up in language, the thinking-feeling that is nonsensuous perception is exonerated from having to move with the actual displacements of the ongoing event matrix that is the body, as it follows its path through the world. Now the thinking-feeling can follow the flow of words, freed from  objective  constraints.  The  infinitely  rapidly  permutating  flow  of words removes all limits to nonlocal linkage: open-range abstraction. This is what is called “thinking.” When we pause to think, this is what we’re doing: continuing life abstractly. Intensely.
