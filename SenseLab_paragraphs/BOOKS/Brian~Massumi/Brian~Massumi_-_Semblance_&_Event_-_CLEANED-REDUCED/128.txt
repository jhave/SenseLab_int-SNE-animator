At any rate, thought and imagination are the leading edges of this exploratory expansion of potential, because they can wander from the particular present posture even without actually leaving it. And without being limited to the potential next steps that it most presents, that it makes most available or automatic. They raise the smudge factor exponentially. A thing felt is fringed by an expanding thought-pool of potential that shades off in all directions. It’s like a drop in the pool of life making ripples that expand infinitely around. William James spoke in those terms. He said experience comes in “drops” (James 1996b, 231–232).
