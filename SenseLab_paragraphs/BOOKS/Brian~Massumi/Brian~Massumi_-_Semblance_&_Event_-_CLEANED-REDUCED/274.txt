Stern makes the point that these operative traces are amodal, meaning they are not in one sense mode or another. Nonsensuous, they can jump not just between situations but also between sense modes. If the activation contour that is the signature of the movement-quality is a rhythm of seamlessly linked accelerations and decelerations, increases and decreases in intensity, starts and stops, then the same activation contour experienced in the collision of two cars may also present itself, for example, in a coming together of musical notes. The operative traces that are activation contours are in no way restricted to vision. They link events of vision to other-sense events.
