The basic problem is that the concept of media was never well-formed. Theorists have argued endlessly about what defines a medium. Is a medium defined by the material support, say celluloid for cinema? If so, is digital cinema then not cinema? Is a medium defined by the sense modality the product presents itself in—sound for music, vision for cinema? That alternative misses the absolutely fundamental fact of experience that the senses can take each other up. Michel Chion (1994) made that point about cinema. He showed that it is not visual. It operates through what he calls audiovision, a singular-generic fusion-effect of sound and image that emerges when they operate in resonance with one another. Neither sound nor image, audiovision is a kind of effective cross-resonance between their respective potentials. The cinematic image, according to him, is a singular kind of relational effect that takes off from both vision and audio but is irreducible to either. It comes of how they come together.
