The co-surfacing of the oval and the plane does not entirely detach from the continuum of potential. The insubstantial boundary separating and connecting them retains the vagueness of the virtual whole: neither this nor that. Neither black nor white, neither plane nor oval. Rather, the pure activity of their relating. Reciprocally, in their spatial separation. Recursively, in a kind of instantaneous oscillation joining the disjunct in mutual Seconding. Actively, reciprocally, recursively. Eventfully: the boundary preserves an edge of timelikeness. The virtual line is the virtual whole as it edges, imperceptibly, into the actual. Timelike continuity is drawn out of itself, cutting into the actual, where it appears as pure edging: discontinuity in person. Unenclosing, the line is not a boundary in the usual sense. It is spatializing (its timelike cutting-in constitutes the simultaneity of the surfacing disjunction). But it is not in itself spatial. The virtual line is less an outline than a limit. It is the processual limit between the virtual and the actual, as one verges actively on the other. The “brute act” of the actual and the virtual relating. Drawing each other, to the verge of formal definition. Contrastive difference is proto-figural: emergently ordered, insubstantially bounded.
