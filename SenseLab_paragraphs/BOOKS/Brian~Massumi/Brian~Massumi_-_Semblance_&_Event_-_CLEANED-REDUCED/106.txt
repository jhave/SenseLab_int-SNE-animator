I’m glad you’re raising these questions. I think that there is a real need right now to revisit the aesthetic in relation to interactive art. It’s clear that saying “You may interact with the work” is not enough. More and more things in our lives are saying that, and we don’t call them art. We often don’t even call them interesting in any strong sense—more like entertaining. If “Please interact” were enough to define a category, it would be gaming, not art. Beyond gaming in the strict sense, there is a gaming paradigm that has moved into other domains.1 You see it massively in communications but also in marketing, design, training, education. Places where it becomes serious and useful. Interactivity can make the useful less boring and the serious more engaging. It is performanceenhancing. It’s big business. It rarely has pretensions to art. This makes the question of what it is in interactive art that makes it art all the more insistent.
