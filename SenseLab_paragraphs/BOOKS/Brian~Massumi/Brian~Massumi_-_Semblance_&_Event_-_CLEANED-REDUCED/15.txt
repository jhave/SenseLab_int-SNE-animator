The first dimension—the experience’s just-beginning-to-stir in a morethan of its own coming activity—is the relational dimension of the event’s occurring. It is the event under the aspect of its immediate participation in a world of activity larger than its own. This bare activity of coming experience finding itself in the midst must, in some sense of the word, be perceived. Otherwise it would effectively come to nothing. To be a something-doing effectively is to be felt: to register (if only in effect). In what way bare activity is effective and felt, even though it lies at the very threshold of experience just coming into itself, is a major question which runs throughout this book. It is a question worrying every discussion, even where the term bare activity is not itself brought out. Everywhere it is already there, where it always is: at the cusp.
