This produces another level of vitality affect. It feels different to see a semblance. Even in something so banal as a decorative motif, there is the slightly uncanny sense of feeling sight see the invisible. The action of vision, the kind of event it is, the virtual dimension it always has, is highlighted. It’s a kind of perception of the event of perception in the perception. We experience a vitality affect of vision itself. This is like the doubleness of perception I was talking about becoming aware of itself. A kind of direct and immediate self-referentiality of perception. I don’t mean self-reflexivity, which would be thinking about a perception as from a distance or as mediated by  language.  This  is  a  thinking  of  perception  in perception, in the immediacy of its occurrence, as it is felt—a thinking-feeling, in visual form.
