The experience of space we feel when we view a painting, Langer emphasizes, is a real experience of space and the potential movements it affords. It’s just that the space is virtual. Visible form has been used as a local sign (James 1950, 155–165) of nonlocal linkages. The function of the local sign is catalytic. A sensuous form has activated the formation of a “created . . . virtual form” (Langer 1953, 172, 173). The canvas, pigment, and frame that are actually seen are the local signs hosting the semblant event.
