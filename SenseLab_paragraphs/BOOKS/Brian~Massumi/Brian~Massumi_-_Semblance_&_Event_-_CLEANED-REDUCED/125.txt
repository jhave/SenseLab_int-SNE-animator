Understood in the way I’m talking about, an aesthetic effect is not just decoration. I started with a decorative example, but the point I wanted to make was not that art is decorative but rather that even decorative art is a creative event, however modest. It creates a semblance. A semblance is a placeholder in present perception of a potential “more” to life. The framing of it determines the intensity or range or seriousness of that potential.
