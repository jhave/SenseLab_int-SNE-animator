Is this doing something that mainstream informational capitalism isn’t already doing, ever so profitably, by generalizing the gaming paradigm? What’s new or different or intensely feeling or vitally voluminous or virtually freeing about it? Paradoxically, the intensity of the dynamic form of the experience comes out most effectively when action-reaction circuits are artfully suspended or (even better in this context) when the action line itself is accompanied by a continuous semblance of itself, an ongoing perception of its singular eventfulness doubling the functional perception of the affordances offered and taken. The production of a perception of perception suspending or abstractly doubling action-reaction is an idea that Deleuze develops at length in connection to an older dynamic form in his Cinema books (1986, 1989).
