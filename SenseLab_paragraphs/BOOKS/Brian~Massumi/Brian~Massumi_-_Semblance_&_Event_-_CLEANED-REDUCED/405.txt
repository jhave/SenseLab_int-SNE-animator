The turnoff onto the associative detours of conventionalized discourse through which content tends to return is already in bud in the direct experience of the expressive event. Crucially, there are already beginnings of a translation of the affective dimension of the event, as it happens, into emotion. As was discussed earlier, a multiplicity of singular vitality affects are enveloped in the affective tonality of the event. The affective tonality is the performance envelope of the event. It falls into a certain generic region of expression, depending on the technique of existence. The singularity of the vitality affects modulate the generic tonality of each event, giving it a singular-generic feel, but the modulation is contrived to stay within the parameters of the event-envelope. Positively, this means that the vitality affects resonate in the event, ensuring a certain intensity. At the same time, it prepares the way for their conversion of vitality affects into “categorical affects”: identifiable, generally recognizable, narratively (or otherwise) codable, symbolically evocative, metaphorically redolent human  emotions.
