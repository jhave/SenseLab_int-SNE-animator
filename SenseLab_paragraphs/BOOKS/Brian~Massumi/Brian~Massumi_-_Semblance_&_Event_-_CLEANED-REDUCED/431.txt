This self-relating of vision is self-referential, even reflective, in a special sense. It is not a reflection in vision, of the world. Nor a reflection on vision, in consciousness. Rather, it is a conscious reflection, in the event of vision, of the pure act by which it always amodally departs from itself, in a reaching-toward the point of its feeling-quality’s relational indistinction with thought. All in the “fourth-person” singular. Of an event understood as a pure elemental act we say, “it.” It happens. It rains. It snows.
. . . It thinking-feels.
