Let’s go back to the drawing board. Draw a line, this time on a piece of paper. The line draws forth the emergent edge again. The line repeats the edgy event of appearing relating. “The line is the relating; see it and you see relation; feel it and you feel the relation” (James 1950, 149). You have cracked opened a whole universe of proto-figural relation. You have invoked the virtual. You have called the potential it enfolds toward existence. Nothing substantial has come of it. The potential is as yet only felt, synesthetically-kinesthetically in vision renewing. But only-felt is almost something. And already a great deal virtually: an infinitesimal continuing of all feeling. Any more, and it would come to less. The virtual would actualize, limitatively.
