Mobilizing intrepidly future-facing creative thought-powers of language, in a mode we might categorize as purely imaginative (literature) or purely speculative (philosophy), is a political act: constructive of alternate future paths for the world that extend its qualitative-relational universe of life and the forms of life that potentially co-compose through it. Language, seen from this perspective, harbors what Deleuze calls “powers of the false” (Deleuze 1989, 126–155, 274–175). He inflects “false” away from “erroneous,” toward “not yet.” Powers of the false as yet correspond to no truth, for the simple reason that they produce truths. This power is “false” also in the  sense  that  a  thinking-feeling,  without  the  actual  feeling,  is  the semblance of an event. As indicated in the opening citations from Benjamin, semblance is another word for nonsensuous similarity.
Another way of approaching this is to say that through the activity of language, the directly felt qualities of experience present in bodies and objects in nonsensuous trace-form can cross over into each other with greatest of ease, incomparably increasing the world’s potential for selforganizing. The activity of language involves a becoming-active of nonlocal perceptual linkages in their own nonsensuous right. The more active they are in their own right, the greater the number of directly feltconnections they can muster among themselves. This expands their aggregate relational potential. More events, more distantly related in actuality, come into each other’s orbit. Their coming into each other’s orbit can be repeated in words, and varied with verbal permutations. The ever-varied repetitions invent new permutations on abstract thinking-feeling.
