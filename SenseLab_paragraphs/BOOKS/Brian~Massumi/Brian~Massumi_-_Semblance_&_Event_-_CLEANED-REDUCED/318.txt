Nonsensuous similarity has nothing to do with an analogy based on resemblance. An invented virtual event has no model to contour itself to. It can, under certain ambulatory conditions, contour actual events to itself, although not in any one-to-one correspondence. If there is a resemblance, it is pragmatically produced, like a truth (Benjamin 1996a).
The principle that resemblance is produced applies to the linkage between two sensuous events as well. The sensuous experience of the word “storm” does not resemble what happens in the sky; any more than the sight of a dancing body resembles a downpour, or an undulation of hands a billowing of clouds. The dance and the storm are nonsensuously similar in that between them they co-compose a joint activation contour of differential attunement to the same event. As we have already seen, the affective attunement is amodal. It is their nonsensuous similarity. It is their analogy. The nonsensuous similarity is a being of analogy occurring in the in-between event of the two component events’ coming abstractly together. It is invented by the technique of existence effecting that comingtogether: in the events alluded to by Benjamin, that technique of existence is ritual.
