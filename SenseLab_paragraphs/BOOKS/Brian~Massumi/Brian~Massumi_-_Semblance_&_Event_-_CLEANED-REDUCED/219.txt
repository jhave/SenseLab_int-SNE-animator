The direct “pairedness” of pure, open contrast is replaced by an opposition between mediated sames. The opposition is an effect of the figure’s perceptual closure, its boundaried enclosure. The white outside is limited to a neutral backgrounding for the inside’s standing out. The figure’s standing out is passively delimited by that standing back. Outside, inside are offset against each other as different regions defined by the boundary: they are spatialized. Figure, ground, and their across-the-boundary relation are spatialized. They are set in place relative to each other. The edgy activity of relation no longer presents itself as it did before. Where once was a singularly direct Seconding across the absolute limit of a time-like edge of no dimension, there is now a spatial relativity of figure to ground across the inky blackness of a filled-in boundary.
