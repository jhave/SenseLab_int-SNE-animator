Language may be the most complete archive of nonsensuous similarity, but the technique of ritual shows that it is eminently possible to activate and disseminate relation by predominately nonverbal  means.  It  was said earlier that objective forms are the sensuous traces of essentially nonsensuous qualitative-relational experience. It follows that any differential attuning of sensuous forms to each other is a way of performing virtual events, permuting or inventing nonsensuous similarities, and producing speculatively pragmatic truths, or semblances that foretrace them. Sensuous forms may also constitute an “archive” of relational experience.
