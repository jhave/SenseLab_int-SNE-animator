The displacement from cognition, with its Cartesian stovepipe dream of foundational clearness and distinctness, to the messy middling goingson of pure experience in all its potential and complexity, has far-reaching pragmatic consequences. This is because the cognitive subject-object dichotomy itself has far-reaching consequences. It extends itself into a division between ways of knowing, and from there into a hierarchy between modes of practice. This is especially evident in the division between disciplines of knowledge that are in a position to make a claim to “objectivity” and those that are not. The traditional form this bifurcation of knowledge practices takes is the chasm between the “two cultures,” scientific and humanistic. The same division recurs within the disciplines on each side of that massive divide, between empirical methods (in a decidedly nonradical sense) and speculative or theoretical approaches (dismissed by the other side as “merely” subjective). This divide repeats as a distinction between modes of practices, even practices that do not define themselves primarily as knowledge practices, such as political practices. Here, the dichotomy recurs as an opposition between “fact-based” or “commonsense” approaches and “experimental,” “idealistic,” or “utopian” approaches, with a clear implication of the superiority of the former.
