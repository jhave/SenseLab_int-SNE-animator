Thinking art is not about imposing a general overlay on its practice. The last thing it should be about is forcing art to fit into another discipline’s categories, and holding it to them. It’s about putting art and philosophy, theory and practice, on the same creative plane, in the same ripple pool. Art and philosophy, theory and practice, can themselves resonate and effectively fuse. Thinking-feeling art philosophically can intensify art’s speculative edge. It’s totally unnecessary to put theory and practice at odds with each other.
