The nonsensuously lived order, analyzed in this essay as “doubling” the ordering of objects as a universe of qualitative relation furthering experience through inventive events of becoming, is real but nonrepresentational and nonobjective. It is moving, occurrent, affective, qualitative, relational, potentializing, becoming, spontaneous. It is self-abstracting from the objective order, in continual, moving, intensely perceptually felt excess over it. It is more than objectively real. It can never be contained within a frame. It is never reducible to the sensuous content of any framing of experience. It is not reflective of the objective order. It is self-detaching from it. It is the immediately lived reality of the objective order’s spontaneity, in encounter and eventful transformation: its changeability. Its creativity. Its semblance as immediately lived abstraction, directly perceptually felt, unauthorized and without guarantee. Purely occurrent.
