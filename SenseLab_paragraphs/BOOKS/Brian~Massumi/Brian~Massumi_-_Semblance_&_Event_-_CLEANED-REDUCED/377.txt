Cunningham’s insistence on the “autonomy” of the dance and  the music cannot exclude this kind of synchretic fusion, only make it rarer by contriving it to occur only “by chance.” Any fusion effects occurring will be thought-felt in the affective tonality of danced gesture, just as in the audiovisual example the synchresis was felt in the affective tonality of vision. The perceptual feeling of the cinematic strike is contrived in such a way that the disjunction is not experienced as such. The experiential differential is contrived to operate nonconsciously. The composition of the relational  field  of  the  fusion-effect’s  emergence  disappears  behind  the drama of its effect. If we apply this to Cunningham’s technique of holding music and dance in extreme disjunction, it is not necessary to see it as a refusal of dance fusion and of the making-immanent to dance of music. Instead, it can be seen as a practice for bringing an awareness of the disjunctive operation of experiential fusion to the surface of dance, making consciously felt the fact that the compositional principle of this technique of existence, like all techniques of existence, is always differential. There is always disjunction. No technique of existence can so purify its field as to make it homogeneous: simply non-relational. All techniques of existence operate through relations-of-nonrelation. Experiential fusion-effects. Mutual inclusion of a heterogeneity of factors becoming, singular-generically, forces of pure expression.
“Pure” does not mean homogeneous or simply nonrelational. “Pure” means: having the compositional power to mutually include; to bring differentials of experience together across their disjunction, to unitary experiential effect; to effectively convert heterogeneous outside factors into immanent forces of singular-generic expression.
