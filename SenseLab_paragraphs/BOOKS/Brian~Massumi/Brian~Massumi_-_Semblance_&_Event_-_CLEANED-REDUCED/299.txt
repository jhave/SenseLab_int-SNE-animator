It is paramount to be clear about this: the world is never lost in thought. Neither is the worldâ€™s order lost. What is taken up in language is precisely the qualitative-relational orderings of the objective world: the nonlocal linkages and affective attunements that are the perceptually-felt dynamic form of what happens. Language takes them up. As its moves, the qualitative-relational order of the world moves with it. World-lines permute.
