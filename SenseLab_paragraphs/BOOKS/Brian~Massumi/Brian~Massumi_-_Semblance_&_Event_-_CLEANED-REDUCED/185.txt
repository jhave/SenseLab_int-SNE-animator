I don’t know. The artist doesn’t know. The audience didn’t want to think about it. But that doesn’t mean that the potential for a transduction of that kind wasn’t effectively produced. Xin Wei, responding to the audience’s critiques, said something I’m in complete agreement with. He said that the point of the Topological Media Lab was to do speculative work with technology. That doesn’t mean that we’re supposed to speculate on what the technology might potentially do or who or what might want it or even what it does. It means that the work itself technically speculates. Its dynamic form is speculative by nature. It’s a speculative event. To speculate is to turn in on yourself. You turn in, in order to connect immanently with what is absolutely outside—both in the sense of belonging to other formations monadically separated from your present world, and in the sense of what may come but is unforeseeable. Xin Wei was suggesting that technically staged situations, understood as aesthetic events of recomposition, can also do that. When they do, what is happening is an exploratory collective thinking, a collective thought-event of the outside.
