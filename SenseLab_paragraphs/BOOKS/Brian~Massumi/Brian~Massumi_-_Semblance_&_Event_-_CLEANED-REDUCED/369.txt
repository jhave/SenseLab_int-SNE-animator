The semblance of meaning produced by the dance is a direct, perceptually felt experience of the body’s power of animate becoming. To dance is a technique of existence for performing a felt “consciousness of life”: a direct “sense of vital power” experienced in a “play of ‘felt energies’” (thought-felt-movement energies) that is as “different from any system of physical forces” (Langer 1953, 175) as space is from time. What is performed are “dance forces, virtual powers” (176). “The dancer’s actual gestures are used to create a semblance of self-expression, and are thereby transformed into virtual spontaneous movement, or virtual gesture” (180). Semblance of self-expression: pure impersonal expression of bodily power, in nonsensuous excess over the body. “Superabundance of power” (Valéry 2003c, 31). Body unlimited. Abstract energy of embodied life unrestrained by content (Langer 1953, 174). The life amodal.
