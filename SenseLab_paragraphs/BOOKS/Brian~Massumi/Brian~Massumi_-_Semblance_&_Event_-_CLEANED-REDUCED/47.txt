As taken up here, Deleuze’s “virtual” corresponds to Whitehead’s “pure potential.” The activity of pure potential for Whitehead is to make “ingress” into the occasion of experience, as an ontogenetic force collaborating in the dynamic taking-determinate-form of the experience (the event’s “concrescence”). The activity of potential making ingress is “energizing” (Whitehead 1967a, 182–183). At ingress, the potential arcs through the experience’s energized tending toward an aimed-at fulfillment. The potential runs through the arc of the experience’s unfolding, infolded into it. It infolds in the form of a tendential direction, or vector of self-formation. At ingress, the potential is abstract in that it has yet fully to occur to the experience’s actual tending. As an aim, or, as James would say, a terminus, it is abstract again, because the moment of its fulfillment is the instant when all is processually said and done. The experience self-expires on reaching it, so that it actually will have experienced its potential only as an onward lure—a reaching-toward something that disappears between the closing fingers of the experience even as they grasp it. But it does remain a “something”: not entirely determinate to the end. It’s not over until it’s over, and what is tended-toward can inflect itself up until the final instant. Thus one of the roles of the concept of the virtual, or of pure potential, is to make surprise a universal, constitutive force in the world’s becoming. The universality of surprise as a constitutive force makes the process of the “actualization” through which potential runs an existential drama. Actualization, for Deleuze, is the existentializing “dramatization” of pure, abstract potential (the virtual “Idea”; Deleuze 2004a, 94–116).
