The consequence of this is that the “purity” of a technique of existence’s expression is a fragile achievement. In fact, the emptying of the event of expression of all content other than its own occurrence is a limit of process toward which the world’s creative advance ever tends, never reaching. The doubling of every lived abstraction by a sensuous encounter means that there are always remainders of embodied animateness and objective order that are nonsensuously doubled—but not erased. Emptying is not erasing. It is taking-off-from. Breaking up is not sweeping away. It is breaking-awayfrom. The sensuous remainders are buds of content’s regrowth: hints of symbolic meaning; provocations for metaphorical association. It is a very good thing they are there, for they are also local signposts for a reuptake of the event in pragmatic ambulation: buds also for an advancement of the objective order. Without the dogging of lived abstraction by sensuous remainder, the world would be lost in its own speculation. The perpetual nascency to which pure expression returns the event would fall on fallow time. It would churn infertile. It is the sensuous remainder of the event of expression that calls the self-detaching universe of lived abstraction back to the walkways of the world.
