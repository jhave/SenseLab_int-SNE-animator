Technologies in the narrow sense—architectural acoustics, recording, computerization, miniaturization—do not denature techniques of existence. They propagate, disseminate, and vary their events. They impel techniques of existence into evolutions, and speciations. Understood from this angle, technologies are “machinic phylums” forming “technological lineages”—world-lines of technological movement (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 404–415).
