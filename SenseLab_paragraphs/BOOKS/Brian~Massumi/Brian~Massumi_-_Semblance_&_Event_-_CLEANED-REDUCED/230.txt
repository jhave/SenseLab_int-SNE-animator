What literally strikes our eye is edging. Not only color, but space, time, figure/ground, and formal stability, in their reciprocal difference and on their respective levels, all of these emerge from the edge of illumination. For the simple reason that light scatters. Its scatter carries interference patterns, gaps, and gradients of intensity: lines of proto-figural differentiation. This “ambient light array” is what literally strikes the eye. (Gibson 1986, 65–92). A chaos of vision. For not only does the array continually change, but a body is always moving: a complex coupling of two continual variations. Even more: the flicker almost-seen in emergent form is prefigured by jitter. “Saccade”: the constant, involuntary micro-jerking of the eyeballs in their sockets. If the jerking stops, vision blanks out. Vision arises from the addition of random jitter to a complex coupling of two continual variations. How do unity of form, stability of spatial relation, constancy of color and brightness, and linearity of time derive from these impossibly complex, chaotic conditions? We already know the answer: by superadding to the seen.
