The doctrine I am maintaining is that neither physical nature nor life can be understood unless we fuse them together as essential factors in the composition of “really real” things whose interconnections and individual characters constitute the universe. . . . In conceiving the function of life in an occasion of experience, we must discriminate the actualized data presented by the antecedent world, and the nonactualized potentialities5 which lie ready to promote their fusion into a new unity of experience, and the immediacy of self-enjoyment which belongs to the creative fusion of these data with those potentialities. (Whitehead 1968, 150–151)
Such is lived abstraction. “Abstraction expresses nature’s mode of interaction and is not merely mental. When it abstracts, thought is merely conforming to nature—or rather, it is exhibiting itself as an element in nature” (Whitehead 1985, 26). As for the body, “it is part of the external world, continuous with it,” made of the same “matter” (or processual matter of fact). It partakes of the same general activity: In fact, [the body] is just as much part of nature anything else there—a river, or a mountain, or a cloud. Also, if we are fussily exact, we cannot define where a body begins and where external nature ends. Consider one definite molecule. It is part of nature. It has moved about for millions of years. Perhaps it started from a distant nebula. It enters the body; it may be as a factor in some edible vegetable; or it passes into the lungs as part of the air. At what exact point as it enters the mouth, or as it is absorbed through the skin, is it part of the body? At what exact moment, later on, does it cease to be part of the body? Exactness is out of the question. (Whitehead 1968, 21)
