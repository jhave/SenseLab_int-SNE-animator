Synchresis is one word for the spontaneous detachment of a fusion-effect from the differential coming-together of a heterogeneity of creative factors issuing into the occurrence of an expressive event. The fusion-effect is a nonlocal linkage. A lived abstraction: an occurrent self-abstraction from the combination of objective ingredients from which it lifts off (the eventâ€™s local signs). What the lived abstraction expresses is the event of its own appearance. It is one with its own abstractive manner of appearing. It is the abstraction of its appearance: a being of abstraction, in a becoming of the world.
