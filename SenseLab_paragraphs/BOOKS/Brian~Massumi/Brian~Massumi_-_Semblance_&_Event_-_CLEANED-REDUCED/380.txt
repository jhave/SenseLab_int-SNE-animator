The observation that the necessarily differential principle of composition  involved  in  every  technique  of  existence—including  the  senses themselves—can disappear in the drama of the effect produced adds an important tool to the project of rethinking the double ordering of the “archive” of experience as technique, as well as to the related project of rethinking the “media” according to the manner of experiential event catalyzed. The way in which the differentials of the field of relation technically co-compose to singular-generic effect, the way in which the constituent heterogeneity of the field is highlighted or erased, can be used as a criterion of evaluation, alongside the possibility of evaluating the speculative-pragmatic polarity of an expressive event.
