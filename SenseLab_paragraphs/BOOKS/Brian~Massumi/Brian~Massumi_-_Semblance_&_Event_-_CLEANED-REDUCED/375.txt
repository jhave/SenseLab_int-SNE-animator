The fusional practice of making extra-dance elements become immanent to the dance is best seen in the work of choreographers like William Forsythe, whose creative practice embraces a wide diversity of compositional elements. Cunningham, for his part, took great pains to maintain a radical disjunction between dance and music, insistently holding them in a relation of “nonrelation” (Gil 2002, 118).
