James, however, goes on to say that “ninety-nine times out of a hundred” our ideas are actually “unterminated perceptually.” It is only as an exception that our thinking effectively reenters the objective order of things to reach a sensuous terminus. It continues on its own path, past the sensuous, making termini thought-felt only in order to keep on moving on. “To continue,” he writes, “is the substitute for knowing” in the “completed” sensuous sense (James 1996a, 69). Thought keeps on skipping, with the all the rapidity language can muster. It keeps on living nonsensuous abstraction’s moving on.
