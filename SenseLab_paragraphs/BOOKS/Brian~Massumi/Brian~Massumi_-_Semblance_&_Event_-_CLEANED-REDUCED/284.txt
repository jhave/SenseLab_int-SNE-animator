Affective tonality is an essential factor in making the event do what it does and be what it was (Whitehead 1967a, 176, 180, 215–216). For it is not inconceivable that the same activation contours that in this situation add up to a soothing might under other circumstances participate in another form of life, and come like a fright. The relational “form of life” of which it is a question in any given instance is vitality affect plus affective tonality: indissociably both. The form of life being lived is composed of their immediate, mutual inclusion in the event. The affective attunement is thus not just between the component activation contours pointcounterpointing into a shared dynamic pattern. It is also the tuning into each other, for this event, of the two affective dimensions of vitality affect and affective tonality.
