Beyond that, there’s the whole problem of the unexamined assumptions about perception that go into the very notion of “mediation.” Perception as I have been trying to talk about it, as Whitehead’s philosophy says, and as embodied cognition also says, is always direct and immediate. It’s always its own self-embracing event, one with its own occurrence.
