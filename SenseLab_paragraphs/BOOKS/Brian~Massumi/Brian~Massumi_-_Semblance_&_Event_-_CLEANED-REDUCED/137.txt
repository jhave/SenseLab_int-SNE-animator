The work of Natalie Jeremijenko and the Bureau of Inverse Technology stands out in this regard. In recent interactive projects, Jeremijenko has attempted to not only to encourage participants to reflect on environmental issues, focusing in this case on human-animal relations, but she has used the interactions to slip participants into perceiving, in one case, like a fish. The ideational content was doubled by a perceptual becoming. The thinking-feeling-like-a-fish was the semblance in the situation, pointing beyond it. A quality of experience was built in that could potentially lead to thoughts, sensations, and further perceptions that might fold out, toward follow-on in other situations that neither the participants nor the artist could foresee (never having been an environmentally aware fish before).
An aesthetic politics defies the law of the conservation of energy. It can get more creative energy out of a situation than it puts into it. It’s inventive in a more radical way than a technical invention in the usual narrow sense. It’s not the gadgetry or setup that’s creative, even if nothing like it has ever been seen before. The setup is creative to the extent that an emergent experience takes off from it that has its own distinctive lived quality, and because of that its own self-differing momentum.
