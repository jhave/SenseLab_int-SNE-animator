The way Mahler composed music is singularly-generically different from the way that Irwin composes with vision. The differences between their practices, qualitatively-relationally speaking, have little to do with  the mere fact of working in classifiably different media in which different sense modalities are foregrounded. Mahler works with sound. That goes without saying. The real question is, what else? What else enters into hearing through his work? We are getting somewhere in our understanding of the manner of expressive event at issue at the point that the orchestral sight of a mountain is heard. Irwin spent decades painting, purely painting, painting and nothing but. Yes, but â€¦ what else? We are beginning to get a grasp on the techniques of existence he was investigating when the pigment bled into the streets and the process that had been purely painting went for a walk.
