The point is that art is in inventive continuity with natural perception. Every art object works by tapping into a certain aspect of “natural” perception in order to reabstract it, so that some actual potentials that were there are suspended while others that tended not to appear before, or even had never appeared before, are brought out. The new potentials can be captured and reframed, and even given functions, political, social, personal, or economic. They can also escape capture—in fact there is always a residue that does—in which case they appear as political, social, personal, or economic resistance to whatever external finalities and functional reframings hold sway (even death). The point here is that none of this is about a tricking of perception. It’s about a continuing expression of its evolving potentials. Art isn’t about “illusion.” That’s not what “semblance” means (although Langer herself uses the terms interchangeably). Art is about constructing artifacts—crafted facts of experience. The fact of the matter is that experiential potentials are brought to evolutionary expression.
