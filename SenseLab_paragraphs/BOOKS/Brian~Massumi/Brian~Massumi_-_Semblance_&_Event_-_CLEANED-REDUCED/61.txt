A further consequence of these considerations is that  different occasions of experience relate only immanently: by their mutual participation in the world’s bare activity, in which they all find themselves in their incoming potential, and into which they perish as they peak. The quasichaos of bare activity is immanent to each occasion in the sense that it inaugurally in-forms them of what potentials are astir for their creative taking-in. Bare activity wells up into the event’s self-forming. This leads to another paradox, one concerning the notion of immanence. When an occasion of experience perishes into the world of bare-active potential from which it arose, it contributes its self-formative activity to the world, for potential uptake into a next occasion’s unfolding. It transcends itself back into the immanence out of which it came (Whitehead 1967a, 237; Whitehead 1968, 167). It makes a bequest to process continuing beyond itself, in the form of its own self-fulfillment.
