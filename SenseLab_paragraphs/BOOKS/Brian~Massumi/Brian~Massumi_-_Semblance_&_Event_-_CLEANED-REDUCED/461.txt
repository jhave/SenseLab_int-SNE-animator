A technique mobilizing less intense politicality makes statements instead. It’s all “about.” It purports to express in extra to its own occurrence—as opposed to in the excess of it. It is content to point to extra-elements as lying outside its process, often as if they lay outside of all process. Common sense and good sense do this. Opinion does this. Doctrine does it also. They go on “about” things. They refer and represent, designate and demonstrate, symbolize and signify. They point the finger and pound the fist. They go on as if pure demonstration were possible. This amounts to a demonstrative denial of process. It is to take things as already where they are and what they are, already made, sitting pretty in a preassumed form, determinately and determinedly just taking up space in a crowded world, slothfully residing on location, if not still, then not moving too fast to point the finger at, before any thinking even begins to be felt. If change is on the agenda, ways must be found to add it back in. The sloth of the world must be stirred to action, following a demonstratively sound program “realistically” taking as its point of departure the prelocated “where” and predefined “what” of things, rather than the “how” and “which” of the process (of everything always already under transformation).
