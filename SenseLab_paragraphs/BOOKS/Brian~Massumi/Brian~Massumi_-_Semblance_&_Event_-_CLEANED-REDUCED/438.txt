A nearly transparent white scrim that goes all the way from floor to ceiling is offset from one of the walls of the room. The lighting is such that when you first enter the room, you don’t notice anything at all. You think you see an empty room. But what you begin to perceptually feel through your vision as you walk around the room is a visceral sensation that something is amiss. The effect takes some time to set in. It nags at you. You think you feel a little disoriented, a tad dizzy perhaps. You feel something niggling, like a stirring on the periphery of vision itching for you to turn your attention to it. But attend as you might, you find nothing to look at. Then it happens. Bam! The scrim suddenly jumps into sight. It’s less that you looked at it, than it jumped out at you. It suddenly appeared out of nowhere: out of the self-activity of vision.
