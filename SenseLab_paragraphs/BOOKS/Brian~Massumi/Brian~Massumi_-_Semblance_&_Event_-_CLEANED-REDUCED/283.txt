The cross-embodied attunements are affective attunements. They are affective in a broader sense than Stern’s definition of vitality affect as activation contour. The activation contour carries a qualitative flavor that is more than a movement-quality as such. Soothing is a quality of lifeexperience that comes with the movements, but is not reducible to the dynamic form that is their vitality affect. The relational quality of soothing that comes with the overall activation contour is like an affective atmosphere suffusing and surrounding the vitality affects involved. It is an affective tonality. The vitality affect contributes a singular quality of liveness to this event. The affective tonality expresses the kind of liveness that is this event’s: its generic quality. It marks its species. The vitality affect is the perceptual feeling of the region of being and becoming that the sharing under way exemplifies—a soothing versus a fright or frustration. Vitality affect plus affective tonality make every form–of-life singular-generic. The singularity refers to the “just so” of this event. The genericness is not to be confused with the objective identity brought to difference following an actual world-line. Rather, it refers to a diversity of events whose singular just-so’s are directly, perceptually-felt to belong together, across any distance at which they might occur. It refers to the qualitative self-grouping of events felt to belong to the same region of the universe of nonsensuous experience. The genericness of an event is with it from its first occurrence. It is the “like this” of the “just so”: a fore-echo of return. When once was soothing, more may come. And that “moreness” is integral to the feeling of what happened.
