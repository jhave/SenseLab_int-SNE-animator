“We must assume,” writes Walter Benjamin, “that in the remote past the processes considered imitable included those in the sky.” People danced a storm. Benjamin is quick to add that the similarity that made it possible for the human body to imitate cloud and rain is different from what we normally think of today as a resemblance. It could only have been a “nonsensuous” similarity because nothing actually given to our senses corresponds to what our bodies and the heavens have imitably in common. Benjamin goes on to suggest that not only can this nonsensuous similarity be acted out, it can be archived, “most completely” in language. But not just in language. For nonsensuous similarity is what “establishes the ties” between the written word and the spoken word, and between them both and what is “meant”—meaning what is sensible (preceding quotes from Benjamin 1999b, 721–722). It is in the ins-and-outs of language. Tied to the senses but lacking sense content, it can nevertheless be “directly perceived”—but “only in feeling” (Benjamin 1996a, 208). Direct and senseless in feeling, in and out of speech and writing, it evades both “intuition and reason” (Ibid.). What is this paradoxical “semblance in which nothing appears” (Benjamin 1996c, 223)? Simply: “relationship” (Benjamin 1996a, 208).
