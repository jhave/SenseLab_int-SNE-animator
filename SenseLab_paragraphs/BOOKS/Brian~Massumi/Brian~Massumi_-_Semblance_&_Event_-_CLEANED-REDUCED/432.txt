It is only at this culminating point where vision self-references its event in a pure act of its own thinking-feeling, that the segue can occur from this adventure in composing-away to composings-with venturing further afield. Irwin’s composing-away of extra-elements suspended seeing in incipient figure-ground effect, incipient horizon effect, incipient vertical gravitational effect. Buds of space. The pure energy released from the visual surface could not be otherwise than kinesthetic-proprioceptive. Quivering vision is not far, amodally-nonlocally speaking, from itchy feet. Buds of ambulation. Irwin’s painstaking investigations succeeded in making immanent to vision a nascency of space and the extensive movements that had been among the prime targets of its project of purification. Inadvertent and unavoidable inclusions were caught in the pure act, in the way prehistoric bugs are found as inclusions in amber. Things that have been purified out of the world and suspended in time uncannily returning.
