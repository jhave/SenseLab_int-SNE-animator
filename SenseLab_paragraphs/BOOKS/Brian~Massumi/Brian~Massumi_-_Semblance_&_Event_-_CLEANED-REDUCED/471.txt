Benjamin suggests concealment as the criterion for distinguishing between enlivening and deadening semblances. It is a question, again, of content. Semblances of a certain artistic kind make gestures of revealing a content that lies beneath their surface. They reveal that depth in the very gesture of veiling it. For theirs is a surface beauty in the sense of a “mere” appearance. It is only significant for what lies behind it. So mere is its appearance that in one sense it covers the true content. But its superficiality is at the same time the only way of accessing the depth of truth. Its semblance is an uncovering cover for a demure truth.
