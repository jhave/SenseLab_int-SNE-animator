An event of lived abstraction is strictly speaking uncaused. Its takingeffect is spontaneous: experiential self-combustion. It is uncaused, but highly conditioned: wholly dependent on the coming-together of its ingredient factors, just so. The conditioning always includes a pragmatics of chance. There is always the odd detail that might unexpectedly assert itself and destroy the effect. Or positively inflect it. A technique of existence must either embrace chance, converting the self-assertion of the odd detail into a positive factor in its taking-effect. Or it must steel itself against intrusions of chance. A technique of existence is always actively conditioning of its events. The conditioning crucially involves the setting into place of enabling constraints to filter and inflect chance contributions (Manning and Massumi, forthcoming b). The pragmatic side of the speculativepragmatic process consists more in selecting for chance inflections than causing in the usual sense. Selecting chance inflections effects a modulation, rather than implementing a causation. The senses are the in-born modulatory technologies of the animal body. They do not reflect what is outside the organism. They inflect what takes off from it, carrying its animate life into the anorganic realm of lived abstraction, where all linkage is nonlocal and activity is in effect foretraced (on anorganic life, Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 499; Deleuze 2004b, 45â€“47).
