What is the directly perceived “self-detachment” of a nonsensuous similarity from a set of objective conditions if not a lived abstraction? What is lived abstraction if not thought? Language, skipping intermediaries, takes up the thought-felt abstraction of nonsensuous experience into its own movement. This intensifies the autonomy of nonsensuous perception by incalculably increasing the range of its potential yoking between extremely diverse events. “The paths that run through conceptual experiences, that is, through ‘thoughts’ or ‘ideas’ that ‘know’ the things in which they terminate, are highly advantageous paths to follow. Not only do they yield inconceivably rapid transitions; but, owing to the ‘universal’ character which they frequently possess, and to their capacity for association with each other in great systems, they outstrip the tardy consecutions of the things in themselves, and sweep us on towards our ultimate termini in a far more labor-saving way than following of trains of sensible perception ever could” (James 1996a, 64).
