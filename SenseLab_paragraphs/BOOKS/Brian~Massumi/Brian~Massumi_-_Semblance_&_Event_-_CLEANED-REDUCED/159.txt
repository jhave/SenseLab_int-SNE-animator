Narrative is another powerful device by which the actual discontinuity between drops of experience is passed over. Interactivity involves a functional macro-continuity. Narrative produces a verbal meta-continuity. The angry words will be explained, justified, rationaIized, excused, given cause and made understandable, smoothed over. It’s fictional. And it’s palliative. It takes the edge off. It glosses things over after the fact. It’s “meta” in the etymological sense of “after.” It’s retrospective, operating on the level of conscious revision. This can be going on on a parallel track in the moment, like a revisory verbal echo of the perceptual déjà vu of the semblance. Narrative linguistically doubles experience’s perceptual doubling of itself, and can do this with the same immediacy. A self-storied semblance. The self-storying reframes the event for ready insertion in the larger operative envelope of socially regulated discourse. This glossing makes sense of the semblance.
