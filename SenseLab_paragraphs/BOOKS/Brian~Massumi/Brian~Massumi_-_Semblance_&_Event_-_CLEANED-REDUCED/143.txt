Photography also lent the aura to reframings of value. The photographic semblance came at a time when production and consumption were being privatized. It was used to transfer the royal “aura” of painting to the private capitalist citizen as pillar of the new civil society. Photographic portraiture could make visible, no longer the social prestige-value that attached to the private bourgeois individual in its public role. This was just a brief way station, because the semblance was already migrating again, thanks in large part to the new traffic in images photography made possible, into the magic of the marketed commodity object (Benjamin 1999a, 2003). What is the ghostly force of Marx’s “commodity fetishism” if not a semblance of life lived through consumer artifacts? There is still a kind of aura to it: a kind of personal capitalist prestige-value that rubs off on the purchasing privatized individual, down to the most banal details of its everyday life. The aura of the life banal. The art of cool. Or in a more mainstream vein, lifestyle marketing.
But there is always a residue of semblant potential left after any and all of its captures. Semblant potential is singularly, generically inexhaustible.
