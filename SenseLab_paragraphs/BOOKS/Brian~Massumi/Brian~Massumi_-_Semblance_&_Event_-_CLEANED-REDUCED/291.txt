It is in fact the objective order of the world that first “detaches” itself from the multidimensioned affective/qualitative-relational order of experience to which it owes its emergence. The detachment of the qualitativerelational order and the objective order is mutual. This means that the separable forms that objectively co-populate the world are themselves traces. Objects are traces of their own detachment from the order of immediately attuned, affectively inflected, direct perception that gave rise to them. They continue nonconsciously to belong to that qualitative-relational order, and contribute to it, to the degree that they enter into new combinations and the combinations change. Each new event retraces the world’s qualitative order, even as it advances by a step the world’s objective ordering. Each time we experience an event, we are nonconsciously returning to our own and the world’s emergence. We are in re-worlding. We are reattuning, and reindividualizing. The ontogenesis of forms of life continues. New attunements are added to the diversity of events that can be yoked  across  distances  in  space  and  time.  With  each  event,  we  are perceptually feeling the expansion of that universe of qualitative order, as we simultaneously advance along a world-line. Each recognizable body or object available for encounter stands for a potential next step down a world-line. Doubling that step, it stands for a coming expansion of the qualitative universe of directly felt relations through which separate forms of life emerge-together in occurrent affective attunement. From this perspective, a body or object is a self-archiving of a universe of felt relation. Separate forms are a tacit archive of shared and shareable experience.
