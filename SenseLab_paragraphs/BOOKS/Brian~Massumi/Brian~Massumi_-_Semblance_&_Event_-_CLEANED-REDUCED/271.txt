It happens all the time that we jump from one world-line to another, re-feeling an activation contour in its migratory independence as it reappears in different objective combinations, from balls to cars to any number of other things. It is possible to jump world-lines to “yoke extremely diverse events” in perceptual feeling (Stern 1985, 58). This yoking can operate across great distances in objective time and space. A nonsensuous linkage, through its resemblance to itself, can bring an extreme diversity of situations into proximity with each other according to the quality of movement—the activation contour or shape of change—they nonsensuously share.  The nonsensuous  similarity between  distant events  brings changes—differencings—qualitatively together. World-lines bring identity to difference. Nonsensuous similarity between world-lines bring differencings together. The yoking of events through nonsensuous similarity brings differencings together, cutting across world-lines and the identities conserved along them. This transversal linkage between world-lines composes a universe of migratory nonlocal linkage exhibiting an autonomous order all its own: an order of manners of movement, of qualities of moving experience.2 This qualitative order doubles the objective order of the world’s historic routes, self-detached from it. Unbeholden to it, it is freed of objective constraints. This does not mean that it would be free from all constraint. The qualitative order of experience has at least one major constraint all its own: its “spontaneity.”
