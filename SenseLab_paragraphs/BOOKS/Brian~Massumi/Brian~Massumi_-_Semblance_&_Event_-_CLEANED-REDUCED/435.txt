So Irwin now started adding. More elements, for an expanding relational field. He got rid of the canvas and frame, and attached discs directly to the wall. Objectness was back. Even the line became materialized in some disc experiments as an actual material band across the disc. He also added lighting: angles of illumination intersecting across the disc just so. The effect was the same energizing of vision as before. But now the art nonobject was perceptually felt to be detaching itself from the wall into the surrounding space. You couldn’t tell if the disc was “real” or a semblance of an object. It didn’t occupy a specific space, but still came across as space-filling in some uncanny way. This resulted from a tension between tensions. The tension between intersecting degrees of illumination (light and shadow), and the tension between the actual relief of a 3D object and the flat background surface of the wall it stood out from, became enveloped in an overall tension. The tension between tensions had the effect of reinvolving vision’s self-possession in a semblance of space. The net effect was a semblance of space wrapped into a semblance of seeing, in perceptualeventful mutual inclusion. Semblance of seeing making room in itself, for buds of space to make their growth perceptually-felt. All of this was achieved through a composing-with: a compositional technique operating avowedly between elements belonging to different “media,” and even reinviting 3D objects back into the fold.
