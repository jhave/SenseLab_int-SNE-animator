Relationality was linked to the notion of the differential just alluded to. It was said that an effect was sparked across differences. The differences concern the mode of activity of what will have been the  formative factors of the coming experienceâ€™s occurring to itself. The effect comes between the different factors. The experience takes off from them, as it takes itself into its own event. The event shows itself, for the dynamic unity it has come to be. It does not show the differentials from which it has taken  off into its  own unfolding dynamic unity.  But neither does it efface them. It resolves them into its own appearance. They recede into the flash of its occurrence. They are left behind by the event they condition, which takes off from, so that they show only in that take-off effect.
