What I’m saying is that when an art practice carefully sets itself up, lays down the constraints that enable its own signature operation, it is selectively activating these poles, to varying degrees, and to different stand-out effect. In the vocabulary of the next chapter, when it composes itself in this way, art is “diagramming” livable relation. Each setup, each situational framing, will orient what happens more toward one end or the other of given polarities. It might, for example, bring narrativity out more than the affective in-whichness, or try to do both equally, superimposing them on each other or oscillating between them. Or it might favor instrumental interactivity more than making the relationalities conditioning it appear. It may fuse vision with tactility, or with kinesthesia, or spin one of them off from vision at vision’s own immanent limit. Or it might be forcefully disruptive, and make felt jolting disjunctions between sense modes, for example between sound and sight. It might spatialize more than eventuate. It might tend to root in the site-specific, or fan out into a distributed network. The possibilities are as infinite as existence. Art is a literal composing of existential potentials. Life design.
