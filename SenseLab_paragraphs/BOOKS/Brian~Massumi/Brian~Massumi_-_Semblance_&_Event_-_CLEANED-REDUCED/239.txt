Go for more (and less). Draw more lines, until a geometric figure defines itself. You have figuratively closed the virtual world by selecting one from its infinity of felt potentials. You have limitatively actualized the virtual.
There is nothing to be done. Except to draw another line. Return to the edge, see and feel the relation. Enclose its active potential again in another figure.
At each repetition, you draw forth an infinite continuum of experiential potential, then selectively deactivate it. You invoke active powers of existence, and move to enfeeble them. Renew, annul. Existential flicker.
