Life again unlimited, its semblance no longer under sentence to express a general truth or personal feeling. Art at the highest degree of the “expressionless.” Bare activity of expression. “No definite direction, no actor, no aim” other than its own intensity (James 1996a, 160). The unlimiting of life’s quiver releases the force of all the intensity that had been contained. The opening onto bare activity is explosive, “shattering” the work “into fragments, reducing it to the smallest totality of a semblance.” A smallest totality, explosively produced: a totally singular dynamic unity. Benjamin’s “expressionless” is what was here called “pure expression”: an intensityexpressing experiential event that is wholly and only its own self-floating occurrence.
