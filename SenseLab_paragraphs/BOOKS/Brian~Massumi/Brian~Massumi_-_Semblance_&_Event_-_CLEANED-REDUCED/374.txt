Each technique of existence brings to singular-generic expression a relational field that is in principle infinite in its diversity. A technique of existence  is  defined  less  by  the  catalog  of  its  elements,  than  by  the relational manner in which it eventfully effects a fusional mutual inclusion of a heterogeneity of factors in a signature species of semblance. It is defined by the manner of the event of lived abstraction it performs. As suggested in chapter 2, an evaluation of a technique’s manner of event can replace the notion of the “medium.”
