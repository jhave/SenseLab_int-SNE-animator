The second dimension—the experience coming out of bare activity into itself just so—is the qualitative dimension of the event’s occurring: its thusness. This registers as the event’s immediate enjoyment of the specialness of its holding itself together in just the way it comes to do. This cannot but be felt. Each phase of the event must in some way perceive the pertinence of the phase before it, in order to gather the prior phase’s momentum into its own unfolding. Even as it does this, it is already anticipating a subsequent phase, to which it will in turn relay the momentum of the event’s occurrence. The phases of occurrence overlap as they relay each other following an arc of felt becoming. In the overlap and relay, they co-perceive their mutual inclusion in the same event. They co-feel their belonging to each other in co-occurrence. If this were not the case, their multiplicity would not make “an” event. The event would not hold together as one. It would lack dynamic unity. It would dissipate before it could singularly culminate.
