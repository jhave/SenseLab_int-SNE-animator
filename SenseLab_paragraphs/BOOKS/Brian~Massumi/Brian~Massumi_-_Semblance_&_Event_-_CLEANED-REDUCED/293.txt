Language gives voice to the archive. It makes it possible to move and share felt relations at any distance from the sensuous object-forms they yoke. Words are by nature nonlocally linked to their formal meaning, since they can be repeated anywhere and anytime. Words also yoke to other words, in a “chain of derivations . . . whereby the local relations” and their senseperceived meanings may in the end be “entirely lost.” At the limit, language can “suppress intermediate links” and operate only with nonlocal linkages (Whitehead 1985, 83). It was said earlier that it was possible to jump from one world-line to another. Language makes it possible to jump world-lines, or jump ahead on a world-line, skipping over objectively necessary intermediate steps. Language is the very technique of skipping intermediaries. Skipped “intermediaries” is also a concept James uses in connection with the affective/qualitative-relational order of felt abstraction with which language operates (James 1996a, 175; James 1978, 247–248).
