The question then is not whether recorded music is better or worse in lived quality than live music, or whether a dance on video is no dance at all. Live music and recorded music are equally performative, if differently alive. The question is how they differ, according to the vital circumstances. How integrally are the contextual conditions fusionally enveloped in the event? To how unitary an effect? Synchreting from what generative differentials? With what variation of relational quality? How disjunctively? How “purely” (to what degree of effective abstraction)? With what regard to content? Arved Ashby (2010) is right to insist that “absolute music” and “mechanical reproduction” are not opponent concepts but must be commaed together: Absolute Music, Mechanical Reproduction. The same must be said for every technique of existence with respect to the expressive purity or “absoluteness” of its event and that event’s evolutionary variation along the world-lines of technology.
