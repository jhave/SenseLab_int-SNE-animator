What a design practice of this kind does is meta-model, in the way Félix Guattari speaks of it (in a very different sense of “meta-” than in Manovich’s “meta-media,” discussed in chapter 2 above; Guattari 1995, 22, 33, 127– 128; Genosko and Murphie 2008). “Meta-” is to be understood here in its etymological sense of “among.” It refers not to the on-high of the ideal, but on the contrary to the spontaneous remingling of acquired regularities of practice with the emergence-level chance and indeterminacy from which they evolved. The practice itself is not of course chaotic. A commingling of habit or law with spontaneity is at most quasi-chaotic (James 1996a, 63–65). Meta-modeling is a practice that strategically returns its process to the quasi-chaotic field of its own emergence, in order to regenerate itself as it generates new figures, forms, and constructs, for itself and others. So that both the discipline, and its clients and stakeholders, live-in a fullness of potential, as part of a continuing process. Commingling: activity of relating. Techniques of existence are techniques of relation.
