Say that on the level that limitatively develops, the two conjunctions just described will be experienced as seeing an edge (complex of lightlines), moving around it (proprioception), and touching something behind that was occluded but is now visible (new complex of light-lines). The new complex of light-lines is a second occlusion: there are still other things behind the thing behind. Focus on what the habituating eyes register: an edge, then an edge. After the habit has set in, the second edge will come with the first edge, in anticipation, before the movement around. It will also come after the movement. Double articulation: before-after. Of course, the second edge will come after the first differently than it preceded itself: with a touch and a proprioception. The before-after that is seen with the first edging is a simultaneous disjunction of surfaces: a germ of space, a barely-there of navigable depth to move into. The anticipated coming-after differently is a germ of linear time. The self-difference of the second edge
—the difference it encompasses between its coming after something else and its preceding itself—is the germ of its identity as an object: its predictability, its sameness across its variations, its reaccessibility time after time, its dependable just-thereness.
