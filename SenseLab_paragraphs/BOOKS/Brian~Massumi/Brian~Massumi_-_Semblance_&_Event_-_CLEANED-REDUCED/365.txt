Movement “doubles back on itself” (Gil 2002, 123). Each doubling back is both an actual transition between actual movements and a form of transition. The form of transition belongs to no one movement. It comes between, with its own qualitative-relational feel. It is a nonlocal linkage. Vitality affect. The experience of the dance is of the nonlocal linkages, not the individual movements taking separately or even in aggregate. The order of the dance as such is the order of the nonlocal linkages’ turning over into each other, their relational qualities accumulating in a “Universe of Dance” (Valéry 2003a, 31) spontaneously detaching from the actual surface of the body, doubling its actual movements. This is the universe in which bodily vitality affects are kinesthetically thought-felt to merge and diverge, repeat and vary, fold in and out of each other in their own manner, sui generis, exonerated from both the objective constraints of world-line formation and subjective pre-understandings of their human symbolic significance or metaphorical associations.
