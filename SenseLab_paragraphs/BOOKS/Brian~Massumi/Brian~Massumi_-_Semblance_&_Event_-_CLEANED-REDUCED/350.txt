Departing from representation means returning the semblance to the event of its native abstractness: the spontaneous, impersonal force of thinking-feeling that comes amodally to vision through the cracks in the artifact’s sensuous form. The feeling of human depth that conventionally accompanies a rendering of a human figure of the kind that aspires to representational “exactitude” is brushed away. The “peculiar alteration” of line that returns the semblance to itself is unabashedly, wholly and only, technically, on the surface of the paper or canvas. The semblance speculatively-pragmatically detaches itself from this surface, peculiarly, singularly, directly for the abstract seeing. “Everything now returns to the surface,” self-abstracting (Deleuze 1990, 7). The semblance makes no pretense of making another world appear, or of being authorized or guaranteed by a depth of order objectively underlying this world, or again of reflecting a subjective depth of personal experience. Returning to the surface,  the better to detach from it, the event of the figural is ambivalent toward its own sensuous content. It de-limits the surface, without giving it the semblance of depth that would make it a virtual space for the content to be abstractly contained in.
