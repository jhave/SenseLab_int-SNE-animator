He then moved into installation. He moved off the wall into 3D space itself, but also out of the gallery, into architectural or even urban spaces (Weschler 1982, 110–114, 147–154, 168–175, 182–203). People normally call this kind of art “spatial” because of that. They think of it as more “concrete,” more “real,” than abstract painting and other gallery practices. It’s not at all more concrete. It’s actually another practice of high abstraction. It’s not more real, it’s differently real. That’s why it’s powerful as art. I have reservations about calling Irwin’s installation work spatial art. He moved into inhabited space in order to make it become other, as he had done with sculpture. It was what Deleuze would call a “counteractualization” of spaces of inhabitation.
