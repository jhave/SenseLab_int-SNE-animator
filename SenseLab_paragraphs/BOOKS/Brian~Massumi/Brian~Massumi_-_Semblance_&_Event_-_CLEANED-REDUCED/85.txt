These Jamesian moves already undermine any equation of pragmatism with a “naïve” instrumentalism, turning it decisively toward a philosophy of the world’s continuing self-invention. This turn to a creative philosophy allies pragmatism with Bergson and Whitehead more than to any other currents.2 In places, James makes the turn even more sharply. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, he writes, the ideas we hold true are “unterminated perceptually,” and “to continue . . . is the substitute for knowing in the completed sense” (James 1996a, 69). A usefully terminated experience in which the identity of the elements in play definitively crystallize into a clearly objective or  subjective  role  even  for  an  exclamatory  moment is the exception. The world usually only brinks on definitive self-punctuations.
Ether-waves and your anger, for example, are things in which my thoughts will never perceptually terminate, but my concepts of them lead me to their very brink, to the chromatic fringes and to the hurtful words and deeds which are their really next effects. (James 1996a, 73)
