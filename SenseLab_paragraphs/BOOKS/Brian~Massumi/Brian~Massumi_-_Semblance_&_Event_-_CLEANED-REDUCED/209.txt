An insubstantial boundary does not effectively enclose. Quite to the contrary, it “actively” connects that which it separates. The virtual line is the activity of relation of the black and the white: a reciprocal comingSecond. It embodies the event of that pairedness. The pure edge invisibly presents the immediacy of spatially and chromatically differentiated surfaces to each other. That immediacy is also an immediacy of forms. The virtual line is the event of the oval and the plane coming-together: their belonging to each other. As proto-figures to each other’s oscillating ground.
