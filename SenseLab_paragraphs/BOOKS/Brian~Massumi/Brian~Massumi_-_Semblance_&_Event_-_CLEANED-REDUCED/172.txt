What Irwin made inhabited space become is a living event. He carefully, minutely, obsessively  prepares the  conditions of  perception so  that an activation event takes off from them. The whole space is doubled by a perceptual activation or vibration effect, like the one he achieved with the dot paintings and disk works. But this time, it’s immersive. It’s not immersive in a 3D way. It’s like a diaphanous surface that’s everywhere and nowhere at the same time, a dimensionless semblance of lived space. Dimensionless but somehow totally space-filling, saturating every atom. The effect is slow to come, a lot of people don’t have the patience to let it come. When you do let it come, it takes over your whole being. You have an immersive thinking-feeling of what it’s like to be alive in inhabited space, and only what that’s like. It’s a perception of the perception of lived space. And you’re all in that perception, every thought, every movement, every shadow, every sound, each of them modulating the others, in immediate vibrational relation, in resonance. The resonance is all-embracing. Relationally self-framing. In a way that is only for the moment, uniquely taking off from and floating in that space. It’s monadic. A world of perception unto itself. A self-embracing micro-climate of experience.
