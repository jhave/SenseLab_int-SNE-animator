That’s the angle from which I would encourage a rethinking of interactive art—from the premise that its vocation is to construct a situation or go into an existing situation, and open it into a relational architecture. Ways of doing that, the nuts and bolts of making potential reappear, are what Erin Manning and I in our collaborative work call techniques of relation (Manning 2009b, 42, 86–93, 105; Manning and Massumi, forthcoming b). The techniques of existence discussed throughout this book are techniques of relation. We use the word technique in a sense inspired by Gilbert Simondon, whose account of technical invention is couched in similar terms of emergent relational potential and becoming, in a way that places the technical object and art in the same orbit without reducing one to the other (Simondon 1989, 179–201). The difference, of course, is that the regulatory principles of the technical process in the narrow sense are utility and salability, profit-generating ability. Art claims the right to have no manifest utility, no use-value, and in many cases even no exchange-value. At its best, it has event-value.
