James defines “truth” as a linguistic procedure consisting in skipping intermediaries in such a way that they can be reconstituted in actual movement, given the conditions. This is what he means by “termination” (see chapter 1 on the terminus and the virtual in James). To truly say where a certain university campus building is, when it is not immediately present in local relation and lacks “sense-perceived meaning,” is to enable oneself or another to go there and terminate the speaking-thinking of it in a sensuous perception satisfying the tending-toward. Truth doesn’t represent things. It detaches from them—in order to go back among them. It is “ambulatory” (James 1978, 245–247). Language is the potential for an abstractly initiated movement to terminate in an anticipated sense-perception, no less than it is the potential to go astray in the world by dint of detachment from sense-perception.
