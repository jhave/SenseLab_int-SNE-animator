Think of a case as ordinary as one billiard ball hitting another and launching it forward. The sensory input impinging on the retina registers two forms, each with its own trajectory. One moves toward the other and stops. The other then starts and moves away. That is what we see. But what we feel perceptually is the movement of the first ball continuing with the second. We perceptually feel the link between the two visible trajectories, as the movement “detaches” itself from one object and transfers to another (Michotte  1963,  14–15).  We  are  directly  experiencing  momentum,  to which nothing visible corresponds as such.
