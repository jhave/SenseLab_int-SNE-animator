But what of the bringing-into-combination of the diversity of creative factors considered in its own right? The elements have to come together just so, in just this disjunctive way, for the effect to lift off. The timing has to be right. The elements have to be brought into just the right proximity, in just the right way so that they detonate into a self-detaching experiential event. Technique is everything. In fact, the technicity of a technique of existence resides in how this is done: how the conditions for the event come together. The appearance of the effect is a spontaneous experiential combustion event. But the setting-in of the conditions is prepared. Meticulously prepared.
