1949, 83, 96, 99). The contents are precipitation. A rain of words and gestures in the micro-climate that is life at this moment, coming in drops. The discontinuity inevitably gets smoothed over. The attending-to affordance that I talked about earlier is one way it gets smoothed over. Useoriented or behavioral focus on the flow of action translates the immanent overlap of experiences into an external relay from one action to the next. It translates the qualitative continuity of affect at the incipient microexperiential level onto the conscious macro-level of objective interaction. Immanent relation is overlaid by the appearance of an actual connection. This occurs on an instrumental level forgetful of the nonsensuous perception at the heart of all experience. The virtual continuity in the gaps is arced over by what purports to be an actual continuity across the gaps. The monadic discontinuity between drops of experience is bridged over by a sense of interactivity that functionally passes over it, which is to say, passes
it over.
