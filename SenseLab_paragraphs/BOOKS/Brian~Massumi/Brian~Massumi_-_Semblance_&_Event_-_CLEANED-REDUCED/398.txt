The term concrescence, however, falls short. Of itself, it “fails to suggest the creative novelty involved” in the world’s movements (Whitehead 1967a, 236). It is for this reason that it is useful to have another word, such as synchresis, at the ready to specifically capture the aspect of the oneness of the togetherness creatively leaving the many: the synthetic, or fusional, pulse of process’s bipolar coincidence with itself. Remembering that the “term ‘one’ does not stand for ‘the integral number one’” but for the thinking-feeling “singularity” of an occasion occurring to itself (Whitehead 1978, 21; on fusion, Whitehead 1978, 233; 1967a, 211–214).
