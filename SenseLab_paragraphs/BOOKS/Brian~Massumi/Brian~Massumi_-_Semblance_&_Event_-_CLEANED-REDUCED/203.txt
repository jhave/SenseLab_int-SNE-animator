“We judge colors by the company they keep” (Lamb and Bourriau 1995, 149). Colors are convivial. “A” color “is an alteration of a complete spectrum” (Westphal 1987, 84). However lonely in appearance, a color is in the company of its kin—all its potential variations. The spectrum is the invisible background against which “a” color stands out. It is the everpresent virtual whole of each color apart.1
