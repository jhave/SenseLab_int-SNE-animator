The concept of causality as it is usually employed is insufficient to account for the creative activity of techniques of existence. Causes are typically conceived to act locally, in part-to-part interaction. The speculative-pragmatic production of an experiential effect occurs through nonlocal linkage in the relational in-between of the parts involved. The effect is holistic. Not in the sense that it is a whole composed of its objective parts. A whole composed of parts is but a bigger part of a larger objective whole. An experiential  effect is  a whole apart:  a self-detaching  event having wholly and only its own dynamic unity. The event precisely expresses the coming-together of the parts, not the parts themselves or their structure.
