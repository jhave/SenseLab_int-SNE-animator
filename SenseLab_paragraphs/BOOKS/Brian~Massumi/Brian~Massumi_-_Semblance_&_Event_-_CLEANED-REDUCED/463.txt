The provocation of the speculative-pragmatic criterion of politicality is that it evaluates what conventionally passes precisely as political as intensities of the apolitical: programmatic statement. This characterizes ideological and party platforms, reform programs, concrete goal-oriented lobbying efforts, doctrine-centered movements, as embodying the acosmopolitical, to one degree or another, however “political” they are in stated aim and however “revolutionary” they may be in programmatic content. The challenge of speculative-pragmatism’s criterion of politicality to political thinking is that it does not obey the traditional categories of the Right-Left, radical–conservative, that are conventionally applied to programmaticstatement based techniques of existence. With the respect to language, the criterion of politicality pertains much less to its usefulness for making statements than to the degree to which a technique of existence avails itself of its imaginative powers: its ability to marshal powers of the false, not in order to designate the way things are but to catalyze what’s to come, emergently, inventively, un-preprogrammed and reflective of no past model. This is the power of language to perform virtual events of foretracing. Its speculative-pragmatic power to produce a truth. It is a directly performative power, compelling without the crutch of the programmatic. It is an invocative power. A “magic” power to invoke relational realities into world-lining.
