This is just a quick example to make the point that interactivity can be a regime of power. It is often thought that the limitations of interaction within predetermined parameters of functioning, of the kind I was just talking about, can be easily overcome by making the interaction evolutionary through feedback. My example of biopower is precisely an example of an evolutionary interaction. It is simply not enough to champion interactivity. You have to have ways of evaluating what modes of experience it produces, what forms of life those modes of experience might develop into, and what regimes of power might arise from those developments. The power element is always there, at least on the horizon. You have to strategize around it. You have to strategize how not to make prodded sea cucumbers of your participants, at the same time as you don’t want to just let them stay in their prickly skins. Simply maximizing interaction, even maximizing self-expression, is not necessarily the way. I think you have to leave creative outs. You have to build in escapes. Drop sinkholes. And I mean build them in—make them immanent to the experience. If the inside folds interactively come out, then fold the whole inside-outside interaction in again. Make a vanishing point appear, where the interaction turns back in on its own potential, and where that potential appears for itself. That could be a definition of producing an aesthetic effect. The semblances I was talking about earlier could be a definition of aesthetic effect.
