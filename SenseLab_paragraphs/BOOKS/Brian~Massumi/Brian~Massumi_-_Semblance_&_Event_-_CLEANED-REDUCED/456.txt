The “politics of aesthetics” does not only have to do with “distributions of the sensible” (Rancière 2006). More intensely, more inventively, and more powerfully, it has to with distributions between the sensible and the nonsensuous: the double aesthetico-political economy of experience. Aesthetic issues of how the world’s double synchretic/conscrescent ordering is creatively negotiated, such as those just mentioned concerning selfreturning, becoming-other, and the occurrent self-referentiality  of  pure acts of expression, become core criteria for thinking the political. They do not only apply to activities conventionally categorized as belonging to the actual domain of art (as defined in relation to recognized art institutions and the art market). They apply to all domains, including those defined as political in the conventional sense (electoral politics, grassroots politics, the media through which political images and discourses circulate). These aesthetically political criteria relevant to all techniques of existence in whatever domain add up an aesthetic criterion of politicality at the core of the speculative pragmatist approach. The speculative-pragmatic criterion of politicality concerns the most basic technical question raised by the events of the world’s double ordering.
