What interactive art can do, what its strength is in my opinion, is to take the situation as its “object.” Not a function, not a use, not a need, not a behavior, exploratory or otherwise, not an action-reaction. But a situation, with its own little ocean of complexity. It can take a situation and “open” the interactions it affords. The question for interactive art is, How do you cleave an interaction asunder? Setting up an interaction is easy. We have any number of templates for that. But how do you set it up so you sunder it, dynamically smudge it, so that the relational potential it tendstoward appears? So that the situation’s objectivity creatively self-abstracts, making a self-tending life-movement, a life-subject and not just a setup. How, in short, do you make a semblance of a situation? These are technical questions, essentially about framing, about what it means to frame an event situationally or house a dispositional life-subject. You can get there technically—in fact whatever the nature of the object involved, it is always a question of technique—but when you do it’s not because you’ve build a better-functioning machine. It’s because you’ve built into the operation shifts in emphasis from interaction to lived relation. You’re creating ways of making the lived relation really appear. You’re operating on the qualitative level of thinking-feeling, where you are pooling styles of being and becoming, not just eliciting behaviors.
