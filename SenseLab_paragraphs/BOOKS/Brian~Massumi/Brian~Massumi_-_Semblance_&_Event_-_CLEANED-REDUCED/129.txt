The semblance, or pure appearance, of a thing is a kind of processual distance it takes on itself. When in the course of everyday life we march habitually and half-consciously from one drop of life to the next, we don’t attend to the ripples. We see through the semblance to the next, not letting it appear with all its force. It’s like the thing falls back from the distance it potentially takes on itself. It closes in on itself. It falls from its distance on itself into itself. As a result, it appears banal, so paltry a thing that we just pass on to the next thing, hardly noticing what the last one was “like.” Only the most available and automatic ripple ring of potential appears, and often even then barely at the threshold of awareness. In his writings on art, Deleuze often says that to really perceive, to fully perceive, which is to say to perceive artfully, you have to “cleave things asunder” (Deleuze 1995, 86), You have to open them back up. You have to make their semblance appear as forcefully as possible. You have to give the thing its distances back. He quotes Francis Bacon: you have to make a Sahara of it (Deleuze 2004b, 82, 128). You do this, in Bacon’s words again, as a “matter of fact.” Not as a matter of principle. Not as a matter of opinion. Not in accordance with purely logical categories, progressions, and relations. Not to represent. Not to reflect. Instead, as an event. In a drop of lived relation that has a style all its own, that exemplifies its own singular-generic logic, and is as really appearing as it is infinitely expansive.
