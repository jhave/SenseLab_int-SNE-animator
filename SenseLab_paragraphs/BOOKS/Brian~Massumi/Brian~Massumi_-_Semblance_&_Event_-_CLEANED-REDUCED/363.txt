“There are other movements,” he continues, “whose evolution no localized object excites or determines, can cause or conclude. No thing which, rejoined, brings resolution to these acts.” Movements of this kind have “dissipation itself for its object.” Such movements are “an end in themselves.” Since this is an “end” without conclusion, all of this amounts to creating a perpetually “nascent state” as an end in itself (28). Lacking an immanent principle to terminate or finally determine its movements, the movements “must multiply” until some “’indifferent circumstance” intervenes from without to dissipate them: “fatigue, or convention.” Even this intervention from without brings no conclusion. The movement returns to the end it carries in itself: its nascent state. Paradoxically, when dance movement takes dissipation for its only external object, it becomes self-moving, ever returning itself to a nascent state. It becomes self-reenergizing. This “modifies our feeling of energy” (28). What it means to feel bodily energy changes: it is now immediately thought-felt, in perpetual nascency, unmediated by any predetermined idea of finality. This change, this gestural opening to an experience of movement unlimited, is the semblance of meaning produced by dance as pure movement, or what Gil calls “total movement” (Gil 2001).
