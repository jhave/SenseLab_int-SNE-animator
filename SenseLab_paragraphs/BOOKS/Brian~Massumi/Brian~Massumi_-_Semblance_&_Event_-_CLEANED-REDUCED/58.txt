The paradox of relation can be summed in the term relation-of-nonrelation. Elements contributing to an occurrence come into relation when they come into effect, and they come into effect in excess over themselves. In themselves, they are disparate. If they are in tension, it is precisely as a function of the differential between their positions. It is as a function of their distances from each other. The factors do not actually connect. Their distance is enveloped in a field effect that is one with the tension culminating in the strike of an event. The event effectively takes off from its elements’ contribution to it. As an extra-effect, it does not connect to them as its “cause.” It comes into its own sheer individuality of occurrence: its little-absoluteness. The phrase relation-of-nonrelation is a way of holding together, in the concept of the event, the differential status of its conditioning elements and the dynamic unity of their sheer occurrence as a little absolute. It is a synonym of “conditioned by a disparate multitude and individually-absolutely self-creative” (on relation and disparateness see Simondon 2005, 31, 34–35, 205–209).
The main point to be derived form this is that relation in activist philosophical sense is not connective. The paradox of the relation-of-nonrelation excludes what is commonly called interaction or interactivity from qualifying as relational (see chapter 2). Extensive use of the concept of relationof-nonrelation is made at various points in this book (for example, in the discussion of experiential “fusion,” also called synchresis, in chapters 2 and 4). There is also a related point about expression. Expression is always extra-effective. The subject is the subjective form, or dynamic unity, of the extra-effecting event. There is no subject prior to or outside the expression. The being of the subject is the extra-being of the occurrent relation (it is Whitehead’s superject; on extra-being, Deleuze 1990, 7).
