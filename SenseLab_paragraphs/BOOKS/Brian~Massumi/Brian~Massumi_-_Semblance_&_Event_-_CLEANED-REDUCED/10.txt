Whitehead’s term for his own activist philosophy at no remove from life’s immediacy is “process philosophy.” For Whitehead, activity, as event or change synonymous with life, entails a further concept. “The notion of potentiality is fundamental for the understanding of existence, as soon as the notion of process is admitted. . . Immediacy is the realization of the potentialities of the past, and is the storehouse of the potentialities of the future” (Whitehead 1968, 99–100; emphasis added). To be at all is to be active in a “production of novelty” consisting in the “transformation of the potential into the actual” (Whitehead 1968, 151). The “principle of unrest” from which an activist philosophy departs requires a concept of potential qualifying process as the production of the new: in  a word, “becoming” (Whitehead 1978, 28).
