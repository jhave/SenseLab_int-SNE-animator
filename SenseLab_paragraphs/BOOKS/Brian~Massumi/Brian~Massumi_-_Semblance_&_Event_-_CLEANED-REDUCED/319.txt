The nonsensuous similarity produced by a bringing-abstractly-together of two component sensuous events results from the echoing of the events in each other, within or across sense modalities. This is possible because the movement-qualities of each component event are already in nonlocal linkage, just as the launching quality of colliding billiard balls or cars was. The dancing body and the storm are self-abstracting in the way Michotte describes: their movement-quality self-detaches from the sensuously registrable combination of objects involved. Thus all that is needed is a nonlocal linkage between nonlocal linkages: their mutual inclusion in a joint event. As we also saw earlier, what constitutes a mutual inclusion of this kind is the affective tonality enveloping the disparate movement-qualities, or vitality affects. It is the affective tonality that produces the resemblance between the events, by holding them together in itself. It makes the singularity of the activation contours of the two distant events come generically together in a ritual event. The job of the technique of existence of ritual is to set the conditions in place for an affective tonality to be produced and, in appearing, to produce the singular-generic event of a dance and a storm ritually coming-together in nonsensous similarity.
