Is “critical violence” but a duplicitous way of explosively holding in reserve buds of content for a blossoming to come? Does the “the power of the expressionless” tend already toward a “telescoping and diffusing into other reals”—coming potentials a world-walk away from that explosive non-place of art  as  a  place  only  of  changes?  Might  the  suspension of the beautiful semblance give the expressionless legs? The better to worldline with? Does quivering life struck with “critical violence” bleed expanding life?
