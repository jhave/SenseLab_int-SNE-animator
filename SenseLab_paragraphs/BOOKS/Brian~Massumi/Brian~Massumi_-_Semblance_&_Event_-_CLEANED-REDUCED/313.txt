This is entailed by the doctrine of reenaction discussed above: the sensible production of a word reenacts a nonsensuous attunement event. The reenaction is in nascent action. A nascent action is the reenaction of a tendency to action. Tendential reenaction recedes by degrees to the limit of the virtual: a tendency to reenact a tendency is itself a reenaction. As is a tendency to reeenact a tendency to reenact a tendencyâ€”ad infinitum. The virtual limit, never actually reached, is where the feeling side of the thinking-feeling of language tendentially fades out.
