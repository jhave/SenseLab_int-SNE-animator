The only sense in which a semblance is an “illusion” is when, as in this case, the “immediately given relation” it expresses finds principled closure in an unlimited harmony of order—in spite of the partiality and incommensurability betokened by its individual framing. Benjamin (1996b, 283) calls a semblance that contrives to make a universal harmonic order effectively appear a “beautiful semblance.” A beautiful semblance is one purporting to offer a transparent window onto a great absolute. A beautiful semblance “quivers” with the tension of this pretention to greatnesss. The tension is such that the moment its harmony is  “disrupted” or “interrupted,” it “shatters” into fragments. It then shows itself to have been all along but a “smallest totality”—like each of its infinitely included otherworlds whose status as real alternate potentialities has been effectively “veiled” by the apparent harmony of its virtually unlimited order (Benjamin 1996c, 224–225; Benjamin 2002, 137).
