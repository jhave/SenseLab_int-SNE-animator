The color makes the object stand out, a visible 3D figure gestalting its way into the brightness of being against a muted background onto which it casts its shadow. Form and depth co-emergent. The ovum of the universe segmented: into contrasting objects separated together. Together: adjacent in space. Separate: succeeding each other in time. “Of the continuity of feeling we can now  form  but  a  feeble  conception.”  That  “feeble  conception”  is  the identity of the object in space, persisting stepwise across time. Identity is the emergent activity of relation gone plodding.
