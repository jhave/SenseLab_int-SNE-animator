Irwin set about the task of getting the conditions just right for his work to take flight in its own purely occurrent subjective form. Twenty years of “investigations” followed, during which time “the outside world progressively receded” (70). Composing-away. Irwin carried his work through a “succession of reductions” leading “all the way to a ground zero” (81). Ground zero was a detonation site. Or more precisely, the supplanting of the visual space of the painting with a self-combusting visual energy that bursts from the frame. “A good painting has a gathering, an interactive build-up in it” so that the effect  just  “jumps  off  the  goddam  wall  at you. They just, bam!” (60). A “pure energy” is released through vision by the way in which the few  remaining  included  elements  reciprocally “act on each other” so as to exponentially “multiply” their individual abilities to the explosive point that they self-release into a single, dynamic, fusion-effect.
