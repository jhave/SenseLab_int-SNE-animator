It can do this only if actions are “broken up” (Cunningham 1968, 91). This means disarticulating the objective interlinkages that form between actions following actual world-lines, binding them into recognizable pathways with pre-understood meaning. It also means “emptying” movement of any symbolic evocations or metaphorical associations that might build upon this pre-understanding (Gil 2002, 121–122). Cunningham’s uncompromising de-Grahaming of dance excludes any “meaning” that is not “betrayed immediately by the action” (Cunningham 1968, 90). Dance thus actively recurs to the immediate thinking-feeling of bodily gesture. Withdrawn from any in-built relation to extra-dance reality, it recurs to its own event. To what it can do best, and better than any other technique of existence: give immediate meaning to bodily gesture, in and of itself. But what “meaning” can pure bodily movement have once it is “broken” and “emptied? Only a creative semblance of meaning—a speculative meaning of a singularly dancerly kind.
