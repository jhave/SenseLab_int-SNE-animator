Semblance, made symbolic, forgets again that resemblance is produced and that it pertains only to the singularity of events. Operating symbolically, beauty presupposes, in harmony, a principle of formal resemblance that is generally prior to the artwork, which then takes this general precedence as its organizing principle. Composition becomes subordinated once again to an a priori principle of resemblance. Resemblance comes before the event, and takes precedence over it. It takes a certain amount of acquired interpretive skills, what Irwin called “articulate reading,” for the viewer to become a competent party to the symbolic reference. With the precedence of resemblance comes the dominance of interpretation. When the meaning uncovered through interpretation is said to be “universal,” read “generally legible”: truly evocative to a typical member of a given community, of a given class, with a given educational level, in a given period. With the dominance of interpretation comes the consensual tyranny of cultural standards as applied to art.
