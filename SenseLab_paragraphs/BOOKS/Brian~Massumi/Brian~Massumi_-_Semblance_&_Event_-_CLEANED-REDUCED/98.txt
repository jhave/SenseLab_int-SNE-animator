The suspension-event is an incorporeal envelope of sociality. The gift relation is not fully personal or objective. It is immediately socialâ€”in a way singularly independent from the particular nature of the terms in social relation. The giver or recipient may be male or female, young or old, or what not. The gift may be flowers or diamonds, or what not. The that holding the holdings together is a multiplicity of what-nots, a ready-to-beall-kinds. The relation is a suspension of the particular definitions of the terms in relation. If it is as real as they are, its reality is of a different order: an implicate order, of ready-to-be-things folded eventfully into each other. If the implicate order is of the order of an event, then like every event, really-next-effects will unfold from its happening: to be continued.
