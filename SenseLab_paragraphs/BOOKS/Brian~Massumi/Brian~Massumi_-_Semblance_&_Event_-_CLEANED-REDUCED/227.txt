When we say these things, we are saying that form, figure/ground, Euclidean space, and linear time are not foundations or containers of perception. Experience cannot be derived from them; it is they that emerge with experience. Experience cannot be contained by them; they are among its contents. They are derivations of a more open process: superadditions of habit. Creatures of habit, not grounds of perception (which, as we have almost-seen, is actively self-standing).
