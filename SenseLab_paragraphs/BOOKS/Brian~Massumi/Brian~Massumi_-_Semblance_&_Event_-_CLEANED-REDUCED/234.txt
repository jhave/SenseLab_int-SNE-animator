Experiments have verified that a “surface . . . being uncovered [is] seen to pre-exist before being revealed” (Gibson 1986, 190). The identity of the object is seen. Again with different emphasis: the identity of the object is seen. Identity is a recursive (before-after) unity added by habit to the sight of a simultaneous disjunctive difference. Identified, the edging associated with the object thickens into a stable contour. What now appears through the edging is not a simple boundary but a 3D contour. The light arrays habitually conjoined with the inside of the contour detach from the ambient array, and come to be seen as the object’s color.
