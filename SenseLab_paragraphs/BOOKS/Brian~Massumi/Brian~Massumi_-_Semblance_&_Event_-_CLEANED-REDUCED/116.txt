All of this suggests a way of bringing art and “natural” perception together while still having a way of distinguishing them. In art, we see life dynamics “with and through” actual form. Or rather, we always see relationally and processually in this way, but art makes us see that we see this way. It is the technique of making vitality affect felt. Of making an explicit experience of what otherwise slips behind the flow of action and is only implicitly felt. Of making the imperceptible appear. In everyday perception, the same thing occurs. There is an artfulness in every experience. Art and everyday perception are in continuity with one another. But in everyday experience, the emphasis is different. It is all a question of emphasis, an economy of foregrounding and backgrounding of dimensions of experience that always occur together and absolutely need each other. Art foregrounds the dynamic, ongoingly relational pole. Everyday experience foregrounds the object-oriented, action-reaction, instrumental pole. That pole comes across as stable because it offers our action perches— ”affordances” in J. J. Gibson’s vocabulary (1986, 36, 137–138). We attend to the perchiness, and let the other side of that same coin, the passingrelation side, slip behind the use we can exact from the perception. Art brings back out the fact that all form is a full-spectrum dynamic form of life. There is really no such thing as fixed form—which is another way of saying that the object of vision is virtual. Art is the technique for making that necessary but normally unperceived fact perceptible, in a qualitative perception that is as much about life itself as it is about the things we live by. Art is the technique of living life in—experiencing the virtuality of it more fully. Living it more intensely. Technique of existence (chapter 3).
