Every vitality affect is a relational form-of-life. Left to their own devices, they are partial: they self-detach from the objects-in-combination implicated in the event. The combination of objects is only a part of what is objectively present since the encounter occurs against a background of other combinations whose own dynamic form is not positively doubled by the nonsensuous trace created. The dynamic form of the encounter stands out from them, in semblance. The partiality of the semblance’s standing out is self-selective: spontaneous, autonomous.
“Realistic” portrait drawings that fail to “err personally” bind a complex of vitality affects together into the semblance of a whole, in disrespect of their partiality and the autonomous self-selecting of their standing-out. The sensuous form from which the semblance of the whole detaches is the tip of a nonsensuous iceberg. An unseen depth of personality is perceptually felt “behind” the semblance. This suggested depth of personality replaces the actual background of the experiential event of the drawing. Once again, resemblance appears as a founding principle. This time, it is the resemblance of the partial view of the person presented by the drawing to the unseen whole: a self-resemblance. The autonomous partiality of vitality affect is subordinated to a suggested whole whose showing sensuous tip is seen as its dependent part. The part seen is nonsensuously owned. Its selectivity is wholly integrated.
