The stillness of the figureâ€™s inside is echoed, muted, in the white outside against which it stands, mediated by the boundary. Mutual Secondness of black-Firstness and white-Firstness is replaced by boundaried offset of white against white. The boundary sets same against same. The only difference between white and white is the relative emphasis of foreground over background. What comes with the edge is no longer a singularly direct, qualitative difference in perception. It is a relative emphasis of qualitative  homogeneity.
