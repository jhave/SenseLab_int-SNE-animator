The virtual is a limit-concept of process and  experience.  It  comes once aboriginally with ingressive initiative, and again at the end, with the perishing. It marks the outside limits of the in-act of process and dramatically runs through it limit to limit. The virtual limits are conjointly felt in the arcing of the experience toward the novelty of its taking final effect. The virtual is abstractly lived as the experience runs through itself, from one limit of its unfolding to the other.
