Affective attunement is transindividual (Simondon 2005, 251–253, 293– 316). At this level, there is not yet an interaction between two selves. It is all in the occurrent between. The word “form”—either in the special sense of a form-of-life or in the more usual sense of an objective form—does not yet apply to the pointing or counterpointing considered each on its own side. It is only much later that the different angles of insertion into the parental relation will diverge from each other and come to be experienced by both parties as belonging to separate lives each with its own form. The spontaneous constraint of life’s qualitative self-organization is that the autonomy of movement upon which it is predicated counterindicates the independence of the forms that originate from it. It is the separation of forms that is learned—not their dynamic relations.
