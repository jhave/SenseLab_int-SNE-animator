Benjamin seems to agree. But he insists on the metaphysico-political point, also grappled with by radical empiricism and speculative pragmatism, that immediately given relation is a nonrelation. “The expressionless,” Benjamin writes, is that critical violence which, “while unable to separate semblance from truth in art, prevents them from mingling.” The composing-away of truth and content is actually a kind of separative composing-with: together, but separate, disjunct, in differential tension. Intensely, duplicitously. Synchretically-conscrescently.
