The residual force of the photographic semblance is what Roland Barthes called the “punctum,” which he describes in terms of an uncanny sensation of the lived quality of a perished life surviving that life (Barthes 1988). The punctum for Barthes is an affective force that makes the photo breathe with a feeling of life, a life, in all the singularity of its having had no choice but to follow the generic life path toward death in its own unique and unreproducible way. It’s not about the content of the life per se or about psychological associations that a memento of it might arouse in the observer, it’s not really even about grief. It’s about the affective commotion of a direct, immediate, uncanny thinking-feeling of the dynamic quality of a life no more. The punctum is the appearance through the photo of an affective afterlife. It is the strike of a life as a force, beyond an actual life, In other words, as abstracted from it, as a real but abstract force of life-likeness.
