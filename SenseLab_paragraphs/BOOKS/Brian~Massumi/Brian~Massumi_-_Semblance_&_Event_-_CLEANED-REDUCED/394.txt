If the lift-off of the experiential effect is a synchresis, the coming-into proximity in the manner propitious for this event is a concrescence (Whitehead 1978, 21, 22 and passim).16 Synchresis and concrescence are not in opposition or contradiction. They are coincident aspects of the same dynamic: two poles of the process of experience, inseparably in each other’s embrace. The sensuous and the nonsensuous, the abstract and the concrete, the objective world and the  qualitative-relational  universe,  are two sides of the same event. The  self-abstraction of an experience is co-occurrent  with  the  concrescence  of  its  ingredient  elements.  The self-abstraction of experience is the speculative side, the concrescence the pragmatic side. A technique of existence attends meticulously to the second, in the flighty interests of the first’s foretracing.
