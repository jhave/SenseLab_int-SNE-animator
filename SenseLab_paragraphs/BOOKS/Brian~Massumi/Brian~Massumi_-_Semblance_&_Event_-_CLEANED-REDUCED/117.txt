This also suggests a way of dealing with the question of interaction in art, and why the question of whether or not it is art comes up so insistently. Despite the term interactivity, the emphasis is rarely on the dynamic form of the experience in all its dimensions. It is the form of the technical object that is emphasized, for what it affords. The emphasis is on the perches it offers for a relaying from action to reaction and back again. It is supposed to be all about social relation, but the dynamic form of the experience tends to get reduced to the instrumental affordance as concretized in the actual form of the technical object. It gets reified in an objective function. The technical object is action-packed. But the sense of action is constrained, subordinated to functional circuits of action-reaction that are to a large extent predetermined to respond to what are taken to be existing needs or wants.
