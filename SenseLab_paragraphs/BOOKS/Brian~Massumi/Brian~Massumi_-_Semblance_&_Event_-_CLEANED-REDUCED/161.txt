Without going further into the language question, the important point for the moment is that Whitehead writes actual interaction out of “reality,” which he identifies with the “real potentiality” from which an experience emerges (Whitehead 1967a, 179). He’s saying that in the final analysis, when you get into what really (virtually, immanently) happens, when you’re thinking-feeling what is really (abstractly, nonsensuously) lived, there is no such thing as interaction. It has no reality, because there is no actual connection between things.
