A continuing-across is by nature a nonlocal linkage, since all of the separate elements participate in it simultaneously from their individual positions. It is a “well-known fact” that these seamless linkages “do not show any observable resemblance” to the objective combinations involved (Michotte 1963, 225). How could they? The linkage is what the objects share through their combination: implication in the same event. The felt perception of continuing movement is qualitative because it directly grasps the changing nature of the shared event ‘behind,’ ‘across,’ or ‘through’ its objective ingredients and their observable combinations. It is, simply: relationship. Directly perceptually-felt; “nonsensuously” perceived.1
Now say you walk out of the pool hall and instead of billiard balls you see a car approach another stopped at a traffic light and then collide into it, launching it a few feet forward. The objective ingredients are obviously different. As is the overall affective tenor (about which more later). The perceptual feeling of the continuing-across of movement, however, is unmistakeably similar.
