Activist philosophy refuses to recognize these divisions as fundamental, or to accept the hierarchy they propagate. Its own fundamental duplicity, that of the relational/participative and the qualitative/creatively-self-enjoying, suggests a different schema. The relational/participatory aspect of process could fairly be called political, and the qualitative/creatively-selfenjoying aspect aesthetic. These aspects are not treated as in contradiction or opposition, but as co-occurring dimensions of every eventâ€™s relaying of formative potential. They do not parse out in a way that maps onto the existing disciplinary landscape and the associated ways of conventionally bifurcating practices. We saw earlier how the disjunctive/separative and conjunctive/continuing aspects of process played through this duplicity. Another spinoff distinction playing through it for activist philosophy is between the pragmatic and the speculative. Instead of denoting a parting of the ways, however, this distinction is used to express their coming together. Hyphens are in order: aesthetico-political, speculative-pragmatic.
