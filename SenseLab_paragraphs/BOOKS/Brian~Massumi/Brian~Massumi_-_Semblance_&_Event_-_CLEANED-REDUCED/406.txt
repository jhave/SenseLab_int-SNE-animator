Human emotion is the royal road to the recontainment of lived abstraction. It consists in the translation of the intensity of vitality affects’ coming singularly together in the same event into recountable, codable, or formalizable content. It is precisely the overabundance of the vitality affects that opens the way for this. Their multiplicity is mutually included in an overall feel. Their singularities merge into a generic thinking-feeling of the event. At that level, their variety is only vaguely sensed. It is this indistinct perceptual feeling of a superabundance of lived intensity that is translated into emotion. From the angle of an overcoding or formalizing technique of existence conveyed by conventional language use, the resonance of the enveloped vitality affects comes across as an ambiguity of reference or meaning. The ambiguity then has to be processed. It can be reduced by interpretation to one “true” meaning. Or it can be relayed into concentric circles of symbolic or metaphorical plurivocity. From there it can spiral, centripetally into a dramatic center of signifiance, or centrifugally out of orbit into flights of more and more evocative fancy. Any of these procedures can be narrativized in one way or another, structurally coded according to one version or another of what constitutes a structure, or procedurally formalized to one degree or another.
