Of course, this isn’t the only way in which language can function in art. It has many nonnarrative modalities—the phatic and the performative to mention just two—that operate in the immediacy of experience and can be taken up with art. These modalities may underlie sensemaking, as the phatic does. Or they undermine it. They may suspend it in order to cleave it asunder—“make language itself stutter,” as Deleuze was fond of saying (Deleuze 1997, 15, 107–114). Or like the performative, they may operate within  language  in  an  asignifying  manner,  to  make  things  happen on other, nonlinguistic levels. These modalities may fuse together or relay each other.
