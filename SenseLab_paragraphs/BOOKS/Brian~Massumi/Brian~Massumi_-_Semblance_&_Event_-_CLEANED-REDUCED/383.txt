Absolute music continually, varyingly, repeatingly dissipates sound and reenergizes it into a perpetual state of nascency, as contemporary dance does for bodily gesture. The significant difference is that music does not have to use the body as local sign. Its local signs are incorporeal: sound waves. Pure energy forms, directly perceptually-felt as rhythm in an amodal in-between of hearing and proprioception on a border zone with thought. The thinking-feeling of dynamic sound-form effects an experience of vitality affect in lift-off from the body. The kinesthetic effect seems to float in a space of tireless movement where felt-energies of nonlocal linkage fold into and out of each other, merging and diverging in an endless play of variation. The bodies of the musicians playing the music occupy an adjacent space from which this universe of music departs, in experiential offset. Except, once again, this is not a space—all the less so for having set itself off in this way from the local sign of the body. All the more Timely. All  the  more  impersonal.  Not  even  “someone.”  No-one  time.  Not  a determinate time. Timeliness intensely alive with vitality affect. The conversion of the space of embodied experience into an intensive time of transformation is taken to a still higher power by music. Vitality affect floats in a sonorous universe, its qualitative-relational order of nonlocal linkage attaining unparalleled degrees of permutational freedom. Vitality affect afloat: animateness untethered. Semblance of pure aliveness in play.
