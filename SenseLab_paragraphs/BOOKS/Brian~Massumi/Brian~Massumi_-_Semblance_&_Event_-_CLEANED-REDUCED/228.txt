This does not imply that we can turn completely away from the level of formal stability. We can never, of course, literally see the imperceptible “ground” of potential over which the figure actually hangs. But then we cannot literally see the figure either. We see our fill. Vision is never literal, always figurative, in an outstandingly direct, overfull way. Acknowledging that does not concede potential and the virtual. For if we cannot see the imperceptible, we can sometimes see the flicker of the figure as it emerges from it. We can undersee the proto-figural abyssing the figure. Seeing the figure’s self-standing by underseeing it is as close as we come to glimpsing potential. We almost-see it, edgily side-perceive it, approaching the actual limit of vision.
