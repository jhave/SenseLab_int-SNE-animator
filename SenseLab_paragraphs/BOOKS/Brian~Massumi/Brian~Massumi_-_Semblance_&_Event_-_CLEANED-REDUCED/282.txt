The simplicity of Stern’s example masks the extent of the relational sharing. The infant is not a passive recipient of the parent’s soothing. In a young child, every experience is a whole-body experience. The child’s being vibrates with the parent’s movements. Mouth gurgles, toes curl, eye blink then close, arms flutter then still, in rhythm with the soothings. The child’s movements have their own activation contour, across sense modalities of taste, vision, tactility, and proprioception.
The child’s activation contour parallels that of the parent’s, in counterpoint. The child does not imitate the parent. What the child does bears no resemblance to what the parent does. The child accompanies the parent, in an orchestration of movements between their bodies. The parent’s movements have an activation contour. The child’s have another. And the shared experience has an encompassing activation contour in the pattern of point-counterpoint passing between them. The overall activation contour takes up the difference between the parent’s and the child’s movements into its own complex unity of orchestration. This is what the two participants in the event share: differential involvement in the same event. A relational sharing of what comes between, from different angles of insertion into a single unfolding. A cross-embodied attunement of immediately linked activations orchestrating a nondecomposable in-between (Stern 1985, 138–142).
