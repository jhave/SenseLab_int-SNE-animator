The senses only ever function together, fusionally, in differential contrast and coming-together. Although it is fair to call each sense a contrasting pole, it goes further to think in terms of contrasting wormhole poles of amodal fusion. At the extreme of every senseâ€™s separating-out, it reaches an immanent limit where it flips into an immediate relation with othersense experience. At the limit, the sense-poles of experience are in constant virtual contact. They are always already in resonance, aquiver together at an analogical distance from each other that makes a destiny of their covariation as part of the same ecology of experience. The same thing applies for stable spatial ordering and disruptive eventness. Intensity of experience and extension of it. Perception and action. Object perception and semblance. Objective perception and perception of perception. Self-referencing and function. Immanent relation (of nonrelation) and extrinsic relation (connective interaction). Actual (sensuous) form and nonsensuous (amodal) perception. Vision and narrative revision.
