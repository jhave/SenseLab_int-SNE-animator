Irwin realized that as a result of his “reduction” of vision to its relational field of immanence, the work had paradoxically started to “take in” space and extensive movement, but only just, as a function of its being just minimally so. He further realized that this “taking in” was but a bug’s breath away from a “becoming involved” again with the actual space of the environment around the painting (99). His nonobject art was now ready to move out. It had enfolded into its own event, and now it was ready for its event to unfold and go walkabout. This is not as difficult in principle as it might seem. After all, the effect that detonates when the differentials of the elemental relational field fusionally “take” is nonlocal. It shouldn’t be such a stretch to spread its nonlocality, so that its “taking” takes-in further differentials.
