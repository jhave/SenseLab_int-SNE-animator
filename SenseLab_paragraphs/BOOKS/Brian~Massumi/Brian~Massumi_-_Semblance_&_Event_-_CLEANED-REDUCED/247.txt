The resulting new construction is an added existence. Pragmatically speaking, its diagram is the toolbox of techniques—from seeing to overseeing, from habitual inattention to attentive habit, from comparison to judgment, from judging to plotting, from projecting to constructing—that went into shepherding a select set of potentials into the concreteness of the construction’s added existence. The diagram in this sense is a constructivist technique of existence. It is a technique of bringing to new existence. A technique of becoming. Becoming-concrete. Becoming, determined. If, as Peirce’s definition says, diagramming is abstraction— an extraction of potential—then the very process of becoming determinately concrete is a process of abstraction (Whitehead 1967b, 51–55, 157–179; 1978, 7–8).
This is where the questions begin. What, after all, is a “suitable” abstraction? If the abstraction process produces an interlocking of proto-figure, figure, form of identity, standard, model, and construction is a process of becoming, then the question becomes: which becoming? Why? To suit whom or what? If becoming involves passing through phases selective of potentials, the question is: which phases, for what potentials? If the passage toward the final determination of the construct is limitative, the question is: is that the end of the story?
