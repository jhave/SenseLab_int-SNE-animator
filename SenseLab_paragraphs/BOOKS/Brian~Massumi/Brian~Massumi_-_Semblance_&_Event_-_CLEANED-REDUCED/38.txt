With this in view, the book at certain points suggests concepts specifically addressing the taking-up of process. If one exercise of experience bequeaths its activity in residual form for a successor’s taking up, might not that taking up be anticipated, in a fostering way, by how the experience is determined to occur to itself? How can an occasion of experience so determine itself as to leave traces of its activity apt to provide propitious conditions for the next exercise’s arcing toward the production of its own novelty of successor self-enjoyment? How, from its just-beginnings in bare activity, can an experience modulate its own self-formative tendency’s going beyond itself, toward a potentializing of other events? Since foundational clearness and distinctness are (fortunately for creativity) out of the equation, it is a given that no event can lay down the law in a way that essentially predefines its succession. But are there still ways in which an experience can orient what comes? In what way can an event constructively include formative potential for what lies beyond in its own constitution?
