The child will eventually learn to separate out what it actually hears, touches, and sees from what it perceptually feels amodally in the relational in-between of bodies. The aural, tactile, visual (not to mention proprioceptive) sense-inputs on each side will be yoked together, yielding two opposing locuses of linkage. The activation contours on either side, parent and child, will detach from their necessarily coming-together. They will begin to diverge, following different life-paths: world-lines. What reappears following each world-line will be recognized in different times and places, involved with various combinations of objects. The recognized reappearances will solidify, across their variations, into two identities. Objective organization comes, and with it the child’s sense of its own independence as a separate, locally self-moving object vis-à-vis another: an embodied self. The child separates into its own form-of-life, and its life no sooner takes on objective weight, appearing even to itself as one objectform among others. The spontaneous constraint of shared differentiation in nonlocal linkage is slowly overcome. The stronger this objective organization of the world becomes, the more deeply will the cross-embodied vitality affect that made it possible recede into the state of a trace. Its operations will continue unaware, with, behind, across, and through the world of objective forms populating life-paths.
