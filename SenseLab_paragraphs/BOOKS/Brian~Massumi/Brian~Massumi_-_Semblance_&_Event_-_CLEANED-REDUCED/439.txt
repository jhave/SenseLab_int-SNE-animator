Vision had been quivering at its own limit, under conditions it had difficulty taking-in. Walking around the room enabled it to come out into itself. That happened because the scrim’s offset from the wall behind it was just on the threshold of perception. It was not distinct enough to see, but not so wholly imperceptible that it had no effect. This produced a niggling depth-effect that was not consciously seen at first, but was already nonconsciously activated. All it needed to come into effect was the actual kinesthetic-proprioceptive experience of walking around the room. The fusion-effect of the artwork resulted from a nonconscious collaboration between vision and the sense of movement. Your walking around the room was not just an incidental. It had been pre-composed into the coming event as an active force for its taking-effect. The viewer’s walking around the gallery was included in the work as a constitutive element of it. It was made to become immanent to the work, as a contributor to the relational field. Extensive movement had been taken-in. As the tensions between elements involved were taking their time to play out, the determinate seeing of the scrim was rising toward the threshold of conscious awareness. The work is not the scrim. It is not the room. It is the perception of the perception-of-perception’s complex becoming consciously determinate, in an amodal collaboration between seeing and extensive movement.
