The creative power of language resides in its capacity to echo in its own operation  virtual  events  lying  amodally  on  its  horizon.  The  infinite permutation ability built into the operation of language expands the world’s repertory of nonlocal linkage to a degree that sensuous forms could never achieve linearly following the world-lines of their actual encounters. The ambulatory potential that language also has to foretrace world-lines gives pure thought a pragmatic issue in the actual world that it does not have on its own. Being infinitely recessive, left to its own devices it moves farther and farther in the other direction, toward furthest horizons of amodal reality. Without language—or a nonverbal resonation machine for virtual events (of which, as we will see, there are many)—the archive of experience would be full of nothing appearing to the absolute limit, without so much as a semblance. Void of thought.
