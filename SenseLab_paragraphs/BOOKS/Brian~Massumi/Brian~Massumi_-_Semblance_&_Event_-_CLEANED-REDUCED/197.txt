V2 One last question. A lot of your vocabulary might strike people as a new romanticism—all the talk of lived qualities and life-feeling, not to mention oceanic experience, a term you actually used without cringing. What would you say to someone who accused you of doing little more than reviving romanticism for the interactive age?
BM There are worse things to be accused of, I guess. Any time you try to talk about what happens in the world in qualitative terms, you’re bound to be accused of waxing romantic. Personally, I don’t think of it as a romanticism. Remember that the ocean came in drops, and there is as much separation between drops as there is pooling. And the pooling can just as well turn out to be a puddle. Sense of aliveness in a mud-puddle is not terribly exalting. I’m not advocating a romanticism of connection. That’s actually what I’ve been arguing against. Neither is it about an exaltation of relation. I try to emphasize that the notion of the virtual requires that all relation actually be seen as a relation-of-nonrelation. Connection and relation, such as they are, are not always exhilarating. They can be terrifying. Or boring. Or restricting. It gets you nowhere to romanticize them. But it is important to give them their due, as much politically as philosophically and artistically, and without imposing a value judgment on them from outside or at a general level. Giving continuity and relation their due also involves doing the same for discontinuity, because they are necessarily implicated in each other. Something that is continuous with itself is so precisely because it detaches its activity from the outside it absolutely lives-in. Also, events continuously unfold, but across their unfolding they inevitably “perish,” as Whitehead would say. Continuity and discontinuity are in reciprocal presupposition. The problem is always to evaluate, case by case, in what way they implicate each other: how they are.
