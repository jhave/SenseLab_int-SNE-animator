What language handles, as a technique of existence for the production of virtual events, are not semantic contents. Neither are they are codes of content or syntaxes for content formation. Nor symbolic meaning. Nor metaphorical associations. What language as a technique of existence processes, directly and immediately in lived abstraction, is the eventful singularity of vitality affects, and the mode of their mutual transformative inclusion in generic affective tonalities. Politicality is always, on its leading edge, affective (Massumi 2005; Massumi 2009, 157–158, 173; Massumi 2010a). The Right has radically understood this, parlaying its strongly performative thinking-feeling  of affective  politicality  into a  thirty-year march  that  has  many  a  produced  pragmatic  truth  to  show  for  the processual effort, and shows no signs of losing speculative momentum. The “apolitical” may well be conservative, but the “conservative” Right can be outright radical.
