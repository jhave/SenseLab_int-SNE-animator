Just as dance comes most intensely into its own by breaking up (breaking open) movement to become a pure expression of bodily power, music can break up sound, to become a pure rhythmic expression. The only way in which music can be said to be like dance is in the sense that it can effect, in its own relational field and in its own manner, the “same” process of emptying  itself  of  symbolic  meaning  and  metaphorical  associations. Music “untouched by extramusical elements”—or to be more exact, music that fusionally mutually includes in and as its own pure event of expression all factors entering its relational field, so that upon entering that field they become musical forces—is termed “absolute music” (Ashby 2010, 6).
