Absolute music, for its part, courts the return of content by virtue of its very abstractive success. Its expressive detachment of animateness from the local sign of the sexed-mortal body yields what conventionally (stereotypically) speaking is avidly construed as soulfulness. How many music commentaries extol the grandioseness of its “spiritual” meaning? Wax lyrical on its revelation of human depth of soul? Pin its animateness-afloat for an evocation of the incorporeal life everlasting? Eagerly take its pure time of alteration for a glimpse of unchanging eternity?
For figural art, it is the narrative powers of language that lie in wait, content-ready. Imagine a story that the likeness seems to suggest—and the semblance recontains itself. Where once it struck impersonally as a force of personification, it now evokes a striking force of personality, its delimitation  undone.
