The force of the semblance can be seized upon and made use of. It is no accident that the development of perspective painting was associated with the rise of court society. The “aura” of it was seized upon and used to heighten the prestige-value of the monarchy at a time when it was evolving in certain parts of Europe toward absolutism. The aesthetic eventvalue was captured by that political formation and translated into political prestige-value. The semblance that took off from the framed canvas was reframed by the court institution, which gave it an abstract function integral to its own dynamic system.
