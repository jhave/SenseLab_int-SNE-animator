The speculative-pragmatic cast of activist philosophy gives it an in-built affinity with one conventional classification of practices, those sharing its name: “activism.” Activist philosophy, as it is explored in this book, addresses itself as much to activisms in the familiar sense, in any domain in which they stir, as it does to art or philosophical practices in their existing disciplinary frames. The affinity is especially close with activist practices that see themselves as simultaneously cultural and political, as these are already grappling in their own way with the aesthetic-political/speculative-pragmatic polarities. This book in large part works from practices that according to traditional classifying schemes would fall into the domain of art or philosophy. But it does this to open art and philosophy to each other, and in a way that opens their opening onto to each other out into a wider activist understanding of the relational-qualitative processes moving through them. The ultimate speculative-pragmatic wager of the book is that if this opening-out succeeds, subsequent takings-up of its tendency might open out of its own practice, that of writing, into other activist arenas in the more usual sense of the word. If the book can be considered to have one central concern, it is this: the politicality of process, in whatever initial midst. The politicality of a pulse of process is the manner of potential it passes on for self-creative successor effect.
