None of this makes any sense if space is considered to be the medium of architecture. Seen reconstructively, “spatial strategies” create the space of inhabiting experience. This inhabiting event is the medium of architecture. The architectural space of inhabiting-experience is always the result of the diagrammatic process of architectural abstraction becomingconcrete, as a prolonged event. What architecture recomposes in new variations are not pre-given spatial elements. What it recomposes is the experience of inhabitation itself. Architecture is a diagrammatic art of lived abstraction: lived-in abstraction, in a quite literal sense. For nonstandard reconstructive architecture, the inhabiting experience is also the continuing product: the medium made eventfully renewable, beyond the final plotting of the design.
