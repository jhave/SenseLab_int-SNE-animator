The fundamentally gestural nature of ritual means that the affective tonality of the event attaches most directly to proprioceptive experience (experience that is self-referencing, registering its own unfolding as its only content; as opposed to the exteroception of sensory experience registering impulses from the outside that are in principle outwardly referenceable to objects). The in-between of activation contours is directly kinesthetic. It consists in an immediate echoing of action in reenaction, in an in-between of movements. Action-reenaction is kinesthetic, and kinesthesia is proprioceptive. It references the relation of the phases of an unfolding movement to each other—its accelerations and decelerations, increases and decreases in intensity, starts and stops—as belonging to the same event. Proprioception is not one sense mode among others. It is the mode of experience of the amodal as such. The whole concept of the activation contour is that the “same” contour is to be found across modes, in the rhythm of seeing, or touching, or hearing. Rhythm is amodal. It is the abstract shape of the event as it happens, across whatever modes it happens with. It is the immediate thinking-feeling of nonlocal linkage. Rhythm is the amodal in person.
