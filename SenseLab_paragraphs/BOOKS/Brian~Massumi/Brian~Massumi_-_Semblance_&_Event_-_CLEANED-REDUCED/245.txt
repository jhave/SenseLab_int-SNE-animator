The empty blackboard was a diagram of the “original vague potentiality” at “some early stage of its determination.” The pure edge of the lone line, the one that was actually an ovoid proto-figure, was a diagram of that original vague potentiality’s continuum of variation at another phase of its determination. The super-oval that was composed out of a number of such lines was a diagram of a Platonic form, the formative vagueness now glossed over in a fully determined figure, the activity of formation appearing stilled. The reaccessibility of the object that revisited these phases in volume, intersensorily, was also a diagram: that of a self-identical form in 3D space through time. Any ideal standard of comparison that might be applied to a figure or an objective form to overlay a value judgment on it is also a diagram. Used as a model, it projects a figure’s Platonic form, and an objective identity normatively conforming to it, into a new construction. In so doing, it selectively transfers to the thing under construction certain “characters” that have forwarded through the process. The “characters” are less the proto-figure, figure, or objective form as such than the potentials that carry across them. It is these potentials that are selectively lifted out of the continuum of variation, filter through the phases, and go to ground as the concretization of a model.
