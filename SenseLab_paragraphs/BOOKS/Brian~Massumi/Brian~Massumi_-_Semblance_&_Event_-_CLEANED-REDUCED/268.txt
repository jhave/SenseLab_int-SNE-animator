The two continuings share what Daniel Stern calls an “activation contour”: a continuous rhythm of seamlessly linked accelerations and decelerations, increases and decreases in intensity, starts and stops (Stern 1985, 57). The linkage that is the perceptually felt movement has “detached itself” not only from the balls in the first combination, but from that combination altogether. It has migrated from one objective combination to another, neither of which it resembles in any observable way. What the linkage resembles in migration is only itself: its repeated rhythm. Internal to each of the objective combinations, the unitary, perceptually-felt movement qualifies the nature of the event as a launching. Jumping across the gap from one event to the next, it echoes itself in repetition. It resembles itself across the gaps. Taken separately, each instance of its repetition resembles not so much other events, as the echoing-itself. Behind, across, or through repetition, the perceptually-felt movement exemplifies itself as a species of movement-feeling. It is now a self-exemplifying quality of movement beholden to neither car nor ball, as indifferent to the cuestick as to the traffic light, inhabiting its own qualitative environment, in migratory independence from any given context. Pure self-qualifying movement: an autonomy of launching.
