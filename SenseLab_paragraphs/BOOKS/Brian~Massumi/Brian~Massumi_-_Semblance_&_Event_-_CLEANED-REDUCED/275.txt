“Amodal” is a more robust concept for this than the more usual “crossmodal transfer.” The term cross-modal is used to refer to a “transfer” between different sense modes—forgetting that what comes and goes between them, what actively appears in their interstices as the perceptual feeling of their co-occurring, is itself, strictly speaking, in no mode. It is the direct perception of what happens between the senses, in no one mode. All and only in their relation. Purely nonsensuous. Abstract. What is felt abstractly is thought. The perceptual feeling of the amodal is the fundamentally nonconscious thinking-feeling of what happens between.
Now instead of thinking of the path of an object along a world-line, think of a body traveling its life-path from situation to situation, recognized object to recognized object, encounter to encounter. That life-path is a world-line intersecting with those of objects, but following its own orientation. At each encounter along the way, an activation contour nonsensuously self-detaches. At each step, operative traces declare their independence, making themselves amodally available for yoking diverse events, across distances in space and time, and across registers of experience. Each trace joins others, accumulating in a qualitative universe all their own.
