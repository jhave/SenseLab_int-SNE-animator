According to Susanne Langer, ritual is a technique for bringing forth virtual events, nonsensuously yoking diverse events of the bodies and the heavens. Ritual produces a semblance of an event in which nothing proprioceptively appears—but is nevertheless seen. The ritual dancer “sees the world in which his body dances” (Langer 1953, 197). Ritual technique performs virtual events furthering vision beyond where it actually stops and behind where it continues, into other, cosmological, worlds that are really, virtually, nonsensuously felt to double the sensuous world. Ritual produces a perceptual feeling of seen cosmological spaces. Its gesturality is visionary. It involves proprioception in the invention of a virtual event of vision, of a cosmologically spatializing kind. Ritual technique produces a cosmological semblance of a spatializing event of vision, perceptually felt at a point of indistinction with cosmological thinking.
