The composition retains its properly musical force of expression, so powerfully enveloping the imagistic elements that the virtual visualization is converted into an immanent music-force without remainder. This becoming-immanent to the music of the imagery, according to Mahler, was so complete that it could take the place of actual vision. On a walk in the mountains, Mahler tells his companion: “‘No need to look—I have already composed all of that away’ ” (222). What looking can do is now best heard in the music. Sightseeing dismissed with a blink of the ears. Mountains and mountains of sound.
