To compose, we must deal with the “constituent parts”—contributory factors of activity—in great detail. But the more detail with which we grasp them, the more apt they are to fade into a remoteness where they recede into nonrelation. Yet they may also advance into new experiential dimensions, forwarding experience into new directions for composition. The diagram, as explained above, is a word that activist philosophy uses to name a speculative-pragmatic procedure for navigating this complexity of experience’s passing, taking special aim on the “critical” moments. These are the junctures where one moment of experience’s passing passes into another, informing it of (in-forming it with) the potential to become again: technique of existence. Klee’s reference to art and nature in this connection implies that they are both compositional realities, that their compositions involve a diagrammatic experience of becoming, and that this becoming of experience is aesthetic in its multidimensionality.
