A nonstandard constructivism would no longer be a modeling. It would not select one set of potentials in conformity with a projected identity. It might, for example, select several sets of potentials that do not habitually share the same space or before-after each other in an easily anticipated way. This would overdetermine the construction. Overdetermination makes the construct problematic. Left at that, a nonstandard diagramming technique is deconstructive. A deconstructive architecture combines what are normally defined as “mutually exclusive or opposing spatial strategies” into a single architectural element (Eisenman 1994, 21). For example, a corridor that at first approach seems to end incongruously in a wall. The potentials for passage and for enclosure are overdetermined. These moments of incongruity and overdetermination punctuate the architecture with interruptors (“inversions,” subversions). The aim is to momentarily subvert the normative course of architectural practice and inhabitation, in order to make a self-referential statement about architecture’s “interior.” To the extent that it aims to construct a statement, deconstructive practice remains “authorial” (Eisenman 1999, passim).
