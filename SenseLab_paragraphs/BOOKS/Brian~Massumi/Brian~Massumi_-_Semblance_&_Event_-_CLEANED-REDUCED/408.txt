Cunningham describes, in the case of dance, the effects of the containment in emotion brought to the expressive event by coding in language, and (which amounts to much the same thing) overcoding on the model of language, of elements that would otherwise have the immediacy of forces constitutively immanent to the dance. The effect is deintensifying and indifferencing: the sense of human emotions that a dance can give is governed by familiarity with the language, and the elements that act with the language; here those would be music, costume,
together with the space in which the dance happens.
joy, love, fear, anger, humor, all can be “made clear” by images familiar to the eyes.	and all are grand or meager depending on the eye of the beholder.
what to some is splendid entertainment, to others merely tedium and ﬁdgets; what to some seems barren, to others
is the very essence of the heroic. and the art is not the better or the worse.
