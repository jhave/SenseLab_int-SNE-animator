The question of how the beyond of an occasion’s self-enjoyment is effectively included in its constitution is the question of importance so central to Whitehead’s philosophy (Whitehead 1968, 1–19). The question of importance is also the question of expression, or what is effectively passed on by an occasion’s passing (Whitehead 1968, 20–41). Importance and expression are not add-ons to experience. They are not “merely” subjective. They are what bridge the subjective and objective aspects of the world, in its rolling effectively on. They are fundamental categories of the world’s becoming. They are ontogenetic factors, constitutive of the politicality of process.
