An abstractly lived truth of this kind may in fact find ways to ambulate along actual world-lines, to terminate in sensuous experience that would not have been possible by any other route: a renewal or a healing; a waravoiding or a peace-making; a renegotiating of relations of reciprocity and power. The virtual events of ritual are not without their pragmatic truth potential. They are not only shared, but have their own efficacity. The intensity of the affective tonality with which they envelop vitality affects may effectively carry truth-producing powers. The relational reality invoked may foretrace world-lines whose terminations positively come to pass. If, that is, the bodies attuned to each other and to the cosmological realm in which they are co-implicated by the ritual are so moved, nonsensuously. This production of ritual truth is accomplished as if by magic, through suggestion: the suggestive force of the shared nonsensuous experience. A semblance of a cosmological truth carries “magical” power to move bodies without objectively touching them, and to make things happen without explicitly ordering the steps to be followed, as long as the conditions have been set in place with the appropriate intensity of affective tonality, and with the necessary technical precision. That this process is suggestive makes its truth-producing no less real, no less effective, no less technical, no less pragmatic, no less terminally true.
