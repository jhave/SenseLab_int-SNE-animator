Take portraiture. Paul Valéry, discussing Degas’s portrait drawing practice, writes that “the peculiar alteration that an artist’s manner of executing
. . . makes the exact representation suffer” exerts a “power of transposition” altering the “manner of seeing” incumbent in the drawing. The drawing’s manner of seeing “significantly extends itself to include: manner of being, being able, knowing, wanting” (Valéry 2003b, 206–207). In a word: it extends itself into a form-of-life. The “drawing is not the form,” if by that is meant a visibly sensuous form (Valéry 2003b, 205). The form-of-life departs from the drawing in that sense of form.
