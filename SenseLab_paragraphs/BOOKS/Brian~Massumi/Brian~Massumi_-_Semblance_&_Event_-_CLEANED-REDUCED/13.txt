The duplicity is in fact an artifact of the immediacy. It is simply that each occasion of experience comes into itself amid activities that are not its own, already going on. The coming event takes a dose of the world’s surrounding “general activity” and selectively channels it into its own “special activity” (Whitehead 1967a, 176). Its special activity is its occurring in the singular way that it does, toward the novel change in which it will culminate. There is an inaugural moment of indecision between the already-going-on-around and the taking-in-to-new-effect, before the culmination of this occurrence has sorted out just what occasion it will have been. This “primary phase” of the occasion of experience is the middling moment of bare activity with which process philosophy is pivotally concerned. Bare activity: the just-beginning-to-stir of the event coming into its newness out of the soon to be prior background activity it will have left creatively behind. The justbeginning is on the cusp of the “more” of the general activity of the worldongoing turning into the singularity of the coming event. Every event is singular. It has an arc that carries it through its phases to a culmination all its own: a dynamic unity no other event can have in just this way. The unity of the occasion is the just-this-way in which the phases of the arced unfolding hold together as belonging to the same event.
