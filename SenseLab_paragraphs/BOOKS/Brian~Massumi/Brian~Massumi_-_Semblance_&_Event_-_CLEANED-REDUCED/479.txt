Critical violence consists in “arresting” the beautiful semblance. “Interrupting” its trembling for truth. “Petrifying” it, “paralyzing” it, holding it “spellbound.” The retrograde movement of the truth is suspended. The expression of the truth hesitates, unable to complete the evocative retreat into the depths of reference. The a priori principle of resemblance waivers. Harmony is no longer guaranteed and authorized by it, so the truth is no longer uncovered by its surface veil. Symbolism and metaphor are composed-away. The dialectic of covering-uncovering ceases. Life quivers all the more intensely perceptually-felt, in a “compelling” openness of indetermination regained.
