The principle of resemblance in this case—the self-resemblance of the dependent part to the owning whole—is authorized and guaranteed by no objective order. There is indeed an order, and it is again felt to be transcendent. But now it is a subjective order. The portrait is a “window” on the soul. The perceptually felt content of the portrait is an inner landscape where the truth of the soul resides. The picture is of self-transcendence, the truth of personal soulfulness. The drawing purports to truly harbor content.  The  frame  of  the  drawing  contains  an  inner  landscape  of unplumbable depth. Its sensuous closure opens onto a whole subjective world. The drawing is as-good-as subjectively real. The semblance that effectively appears once again purports not to be one. Rather than assuming its status of nonsensuous similarity tuned to real differentials, it subordinates itself to a subjective principle of self-identity. Instead of making felt its participation in a double existence between sensuous form and the nonsensuous universe of a qualitative-relational order whose elements are autonomous and contribute their spontaneity to it, the semblance settles for the redundancy of self-resemblance. Instead of living up to the power of the false, it settles for a “the” truth.
