The cyborg, for its part, presents itself as an empirically reachable point of passage. It figures itself as a threshold. Its passing "out" is self-avowedly immanent: the cyborg is always presented as passing to the limit of a tendency that has already germinated within the human. Yet even as a "reachable" pole, it is in continual variation. What the human expedition might find on arrival cannot accurately be predicted. Even less so what foldings-back that the arrival would envelop (would the cyborg have emotion?). The cyborg is speculative, rather than spectral. Its mode of reality is not that of fiction, but rather of fabulation. A fabulation is also empirically empty, devoid of actual content. Yet it is neither sublime nor abject in a way that would oppose it to the divine (a pious cyborg is not unimaginable). It is not the anti-pole of the divine, but rather its dipole. It is is simply and mundanely, as distinct from profanely, an already-under way--a transformative passing knocking vaguely at the door of sensation, like a muffled echo of the future. Its presence is paradoxical (a aysymmetrical going-and-coming, where what is come to is different from what is gone from) rather than spectral (pure return). The divine pole only manages to express clearly one half of the asymmetry of self-recursion. The one-sidedness of divine expression condemns it to the symmetry of dialectical contradiction between unsynthesizable poles. The sacred is a one-way cycle: a  return the bottom tends to fall out of. The cyborg, on the other hand, is a transformative circuit. Its self-recursion, as a threshold state, makes a cross-over. The asymmetry of the coming-and-going of the human and the cyborg describes the irreversibility of a qualitative transformation: phase shift, as against pure return.
