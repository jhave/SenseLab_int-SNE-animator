Put two teams on a grassy field with goals at either end, and you have an immediate, palpable tension. The attraction of which the goals and ground are inductive signs is invisible and nonsubstantial: it is a tensile force-field activated by the presence of bodies within the signed limits. The polarity of the goals defines every point in the field and every movement on the field in terms of force--specifically, as the potential motion of the ball, and of the teams, towards the goal. When the ball nears a goal, the play reaches a pitch of intensity. Every gesture of the players is supercharged, toward a goal or toward repelling one. The ball is charged to the highest degree with potential movement toward the goal, by its position on the field, by the collective tending of the team homing in for a score. The slightest slip or miscalculation will de-potentialize that movement. When that happens, a release of tension as palpable as its earlier build-up undulates across the field.
