It appears I had been operating on two separate systems of reference: a predominantly proprioceptive system of reference operating in the tunnel-like bowels of the building, and a predominantly visual system of reference for the vistas outside. The two systems were not calibrated to each other. Or they hadnâ€™t been, until my moment of hallucinatory truth before the window. Their respective spaces of orientation had been noncommunicating, like qualitatively different monads of experience. The idea that this is not as unusual a situation as my initial concern had suggested came to me in the subway on the way home. If you have ever ridden a subway, it is likely that you have had a similarly jarring experience when surfacing to street level.
