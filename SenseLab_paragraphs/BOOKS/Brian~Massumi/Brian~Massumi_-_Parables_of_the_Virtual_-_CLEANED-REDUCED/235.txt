The current capitalist mode of power could be called control: neither coding nor codification, neither regularization nor regulation, but the immanently encompassing modulation of both [Deleuze; Massumi, "Req"]. The power of control is predicated on decoding (rendering signs objectively indeterminate, immanent, charged with potential) and deterritoritorialization (the drawing off of the event from its general-particular spaces of expression and, in this case, its consignment to a distributed, intervallic space of its own). The power of control is decoding and deterritorialization, delivered (ready for catalysis into a containment-event in a new space; ready for recodification and reterritorialization; ready to be converted into a local modification). Control is modulation itself made powerful (made a factor of containment--its flow factor). It is the powering-up of potential. The ultimate capture--not of the elements of expression, not even of expression, but of the event itself. It is in no way underestimating capitalist control to call its worldwide trafficking in modulation the stylization of power. It was argued earlier that the model of power was usurpation. What is being usurped here? The very expression of potential. The movement of relationality. Becoming-together. Belonging. Capitalism is the global usurpation of belonging.
