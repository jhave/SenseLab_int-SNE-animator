(The need to keep deriving time from space and space from time testifies to the inadequacy of the terms. The body without an image is a seamless spatiotemporal mix [as is empirical space as understood by physics]. Still, time and space concepts are necessary heuristic devices for thinking the speci­fic­ity of the interlock­ing processes contribut­ing to the construc­tion of the body without an image. See chapter 8 below for more on spatiotemporality)
