What better word for becoming-in-the-interval, that movement-between, than thought? Terms for collective agency are thought blocks: anti-thought. The linguistic capture of thought. Hence the anxiety in so much contemporary theory over how "theory" might be made "resistance." Thought can only be re-triggered by a reconversion of the general-particular into singularity, whose condition of expression is sensation. "Fiction" in a different sense (Foucault's, for example) is the practice of that reconversion, which requires drawing on the performative (catalytic) resources of language (language as a practice of incorporeal transformation rather than as a vector of generalization). This process might be called fabulation, in order to distinguish it from its eponymous anti-thought. Fabulation is a reversal of the flow from sensation to generality. It is making language a sensation again, making it rejoin the circuit of potentialization, putting back in phase. This is also "natural" (necessary for becoming). Only theorizing that naturally embraces fabulation can effect the conversion of the general. Embracing fabulation theoretically means writing style. Making theory "resistant" means making its writing prehend the aesthetic--which it was argued earlier is one with ontological emergence [a point developed by Guattari]. Few contemporary theorists have been so stylistically astute as the "fictional" Foucault. Few, also, have been so becoming. It was inevitable that his biography would scandalize.
