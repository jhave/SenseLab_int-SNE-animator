Every awareness that achieves actual expression will have been in some way modulated by the swarm from which it emerged. But the modulatory effect is in principle separable from what the result would have been, had the recursively durational monad not smudged. This “would have been” discrete of actual awareness can potentially be accessed, if experience folds back on itself, cross-references, and pulls on the right strand to extract an associated form from the fusional smudge. The effective discreteness of an awareness is an active creation of experience doubling back (on its already recursive duration) and extractively self-referencing. Every first-time perception of form is already, virtually, a memory. Perception is an intensive movement back into and out of an abstract “space” of experiential previousness.
