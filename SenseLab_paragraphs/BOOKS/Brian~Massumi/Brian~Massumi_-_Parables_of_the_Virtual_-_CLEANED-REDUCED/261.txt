If every collective individuation is inseparable from a doubling dimension of  
becoming, it also participates in an evolution, a diverging-together conditioned by the stockpiling of differential potential in bodies occupying regions of the same field of interaction and expressing themselves according to disconsonant rhythms in mutual embrace. Evolution is the corporeality of the incorporeal, the embodying of the event of belonging (genealogy). So a collective individuation has a becoming and an evolution. But does it have a history?
