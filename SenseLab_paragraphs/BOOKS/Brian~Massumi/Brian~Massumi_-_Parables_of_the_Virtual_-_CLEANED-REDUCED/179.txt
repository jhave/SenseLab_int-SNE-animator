The basic insight of Bergson’s philosophy, taken up by William James and later Gilles Deleuze, is that past and future are not just strung-out punctual presents. They are continuous dimensions contemporaneous to every present--which is by nature a smudged becoming, not a point-state. As Deleuze repeatedly points out, the present would never “pass” if it didn’t have a dimension of “passness” or pastness to fold aspects of itself into as folds out others into what will have presently been its futurity. Past and future are in direct, topological proximity with each other, operatively joined in a continuity of mutual folding. The present is the crease. The moments of time are dimensions of each other’s unity of movement into and out of each other. They are co-operating dimensions of transition. A body does not coincide with the discretely cognizable point of its here-and-now (remember the Libet-lag). It coincides with the twisted continuity of its variations, registered in an endless doppler loop.
