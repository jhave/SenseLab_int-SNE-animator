What is clear is that Reagan is not concerned with the difference between reality and appearance. He seems to be speaking of two orders of reality – both of which are composed of appearance, understood more in a performative than epistemological sense. The relevant distinction is not between reality and appearance, true and false, acting and not acting, seeing and not seeing oneself as others see one. The pertinent criterion of evalu­ation is ontological, and cuts across those registers. It bears on the completeness of an appear­ance, which it locates on a scale of intensity, as a higher- or lower-degree reality.
