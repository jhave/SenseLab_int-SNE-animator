If objectivity is the substantialization of relation, subjectivity is the absorption of the same relationality into a general principle. General principle: without substance. The "subject" is the absorption of relation into an immaterial term [Simondon]. A particular subject is a region of absorbed--hyper-hypostasized--relation. What makes the subject a "subject" is its generality, its immateriality. What makes it a "term" is its substance. "The" subject is a term into extrinsic relation with others of its type through the mediation of its substantial housing. As current cultural-theoretical usage so tiresomely illustrates, every subject is "The" subject, the subject-in-general. "The" subject is only a particular subject to the extent that it surrenders itself to embodied mediation. A subject is particular to the extent that it is what it is not: its housing, its "body." The endless oscillation in contemporary cultural theory between "the subject" and "bodies" expresses this impasse. It is an unmistakeable indication that cultural theory overall is still stumbling along within the Hegelian horizon. For is this not the movement of Spirit? The movement of Spirit--aborted by the well-justified contemporary refusal of teleology. Without an end in sight where empiricial substance and Spirit might meld, all that is left is the impasse. "Dialectics without synthesis." The epistem√® of contemporary theory is an imprisonment of thought in the irreparability of Hegelian Spirit. Despite vigorous denials, the "materialism" of most cultural theory today is a broken-down idealism.
