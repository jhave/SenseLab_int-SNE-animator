The feedback of “higher” functions undermines the deconstructionist mistrust of “naïve” or “natural” perception. In deconstructivist architectural theory, this mistrust has often translated into an aversion to any talk of direct perception, shunned in favor of mediated readings. But if social operations like recognizing a face or cultural operations of literate interpretion can dissolve back into direct perceptions, there is nothing to worry about. If there is never any possibility of “raw” experience to begin with, there is nothing to bracket or deconstruct. The most material of experience, the firing of a single neuron, is “always already” positively socio-cultural. Conversely, and perhaps more provocatively, reading ceases to be a practice of mediation. We are capable of operating socially and culturally directly on a level with matter.
