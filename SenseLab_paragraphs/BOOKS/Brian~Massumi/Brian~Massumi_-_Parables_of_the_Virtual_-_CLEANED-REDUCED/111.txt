The color blue figured in Katz’s experimental situation in divergent capacities. It was differential object. Along one axis, or in one of its differential dimensions, it was matched standard assignable by common consensus to things other than itself and which it equally inhered: a retina and a test patch. It figured as an attribute (or common property incumbent in standardized language use). It was also an asymmetrically owned mismemory that was assumed to be knowable but whose exact nature was yet to be determined by follow-up experimentation. In this dimension, it was a multvalent content, at once of inalienable personalized memory and of a public discourse of knowing capture. When we speak of “an” object, what we are referring to is a complex interweaving of attributes and contents, as subsumed under a nominal identity (a name). “An” object subsumes a multiplicity that evolves situationally. Every object is an evolving differential: a snow-balling, open-ended variation on itself.
