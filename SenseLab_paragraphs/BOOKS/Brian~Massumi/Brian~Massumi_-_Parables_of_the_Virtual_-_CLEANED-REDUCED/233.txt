"Communications" is a special mode of power that lubricates event-spaces in a bath of indeterminacy, smoothing the thresholds of containment. Resistance and containment are contained--in flow. They are wafted. Resistance-and-containment, together, are wafted, modulated by technologies trucking with the indeterminate. Their wafting indexes them to the not-self-referentiality of their threshold, the interval: something that is not exactly outside, but is still exorbital to the event-space of arrival. A pseudo exo-referentiality--to the indeterminate. (Agamben [1995] develops a Heideggerian account of communicability that differs from the one offered here in its emphasis on language as the "irreparably" unshowable showing of truth. Here, communicability is refered to synaesthetic sensation as transductive multi-channeling, conditioning not only language but movement, at the hinge between them.)
