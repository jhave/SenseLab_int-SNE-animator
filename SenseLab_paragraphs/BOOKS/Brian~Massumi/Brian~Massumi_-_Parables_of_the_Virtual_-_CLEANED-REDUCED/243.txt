To sum up, substance, subject and object are derivatives of the same process culminating in language. Strictly speaking, there is no substance. There is only substantialization--of which immateriality is a special case. Subject and object have only nominal existence. They are in words. More precisely, they are in the relation of words to perception. To say that the conditions of existence of discrete empirical terms are in words is not at all to trip back into the horizon of idealism. Quite the contrary. For if the being of subject and object is in language, their becoming, for its part, can only be outside language, or at its threshold, in its in-between with perception. This is the same in-between as between perception-to-perception. The saying of perception shares the same doubled-over interval as the perception of perception: sensation, thrice over. The becoming of substance, subject, object is triply in sensation. If their being is a fictional (nominal) existence, their becoming is sensible reality.
