Only as a function of Static capture. Never do two empirical terms effectively relate to one another term to term, in linear fashion. The price of relation is stepping into an ontological circuit of potentialization-and-containment. There is no linear relation from one empirical term to another, as cause to effect. The would-be progression is always staggered by a lapse into immanence, into a transformative intervallic indeterminacy from which something new and unexpected always emerges, if only residually. Another name for transformative intervallic indeterminacy is force (Foucault again). No empirical investigator has ever observed a force. As Hume pointed out, only force-effects are observable. Force is only in its expression. Force belongs to a different ontological dimension from that which it effects. It is super-empirical. There are no empirical "laws" of nature or of culture, only iteration-effects: inter-accumulating, mutually prehending periodicities (probabilities). These most directly concern potential and its framing, its self-standing cumulative capture--rather than any grounding necessity or founding determination. Cache makes a similar point, inspired by Eugène Dupréel, "whose philosophy was centered entirely on the notion of frame of probability." In the classical causal scheme, "no value has been attributed to the interval that separates cause from the realization of its effect. For a cause to produce an effect, this interval  must be filled. For in and of themselves, the set of causes that produce an effect are only frames of probability. One never knows how the interval will be filled; otherwise, everything that is known about the interval would cross over to the side of the cause, and all one would have done is to define a more restricted frame of probability. And if, by any chance, no indeterminacy remained in the interval, the cause would become identical to the effect and nothing new could happen at all. "[23]
