The Argument from Inner Space. The body is composed of a branching network, decreasing in size right down to the level of molecular tubes at the mitochondrial scale. Geometrically, a body is a “space-filling fractal” of a “fourth” dimensionality, between a two-dimensional plane and a three-dimensional volume.xxii “Our skin obeys the laws of three dimensions ... but our internal anatomy and physiology is living in a four-dimensional spatial world” (the three of enveloping Euclidean space plus the “fourth” fractal dimension of internal branching).xxiii If If a body lives in three dimensions only at the envelope of the skin. The “Euclidean” space of the body is a membrane.
