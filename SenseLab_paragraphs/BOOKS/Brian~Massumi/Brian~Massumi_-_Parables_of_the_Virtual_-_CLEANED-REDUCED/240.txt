The "objective" is a language-culminated perception-effect consisting in the substantialization of relation. The "subject" is a continuation of the same process. To the body registering the stasis-effect, only itself--the self-standing region of interaction that it "is"--will appear to move. Its own name (and pronoun) will then designate the principle of the movement. To the extent that other bodies fail to register as stasis-effects, they will be perceived as harnessing the same principle of movement. The self-standings of relationality become the self-propulsions of bodies. Prehension itself now hypostasizes, into agency. Bodies are now perceived as the substantial housings of agencies. (The model of domesticity?) Any body perceived to be another "subject" will appear to share in the same principle of movement. The particular subject is a housed harnessing of that general principle: "subjectivity."
