The problem can be got at etymologically. "Cultural" and "social" are back-formations from "society" and "culture." The adjectival forms appeared long after their substantive parents. But as adjectives, they have a fluidity that their substantives lack. They can be applied narrowly or broadly, to qualify anything. They function in a way akin to shifters. Wherever they go, they drag an after-image of their parents. Each use of the terms evokes a spectral substantive that comes back to the fore whenever the question of agency arises. "Society" and "culture" tag along after their adjectives, stepping in whenever the need arises to attribute a causative agent. Their agency is implied, even when it is not explicitly invoked. They are the generally implied subject of the statement, in perpetual adjectival shift, going wherever "social" and "cultural" go. And in these interdisciplinary days, that is just about everywhere. "Society" and "culture" are the near-universal subject of theoretical statements of interdisiplinarity and transdisciplinary (the institutional footholds of the "hybrid"), as well as of those produced by their dedicated particular disciplines (sociology and anthropology, for example). The problem is that not only are "society" and "culture" not subjects--they are not even objects.
