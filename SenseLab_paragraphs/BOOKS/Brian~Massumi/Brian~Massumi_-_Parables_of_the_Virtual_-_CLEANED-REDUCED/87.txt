Find a cultural-theoretical vocabulary specific to the body. Use it to express the unmediated par­ticipation of the flesh in the image (whether “natural” or mass-mediated). Find a logic for the corporeal (body and image) that does not oppose it to the virtual, even as it distinguishes­ them, as dimensions of each other. Find a logic for the virtual (imagelessness and potential) that does not remove it from the real; for example by equating it with the imaginary. Dissever, instead, the imageless from the Ideal.
