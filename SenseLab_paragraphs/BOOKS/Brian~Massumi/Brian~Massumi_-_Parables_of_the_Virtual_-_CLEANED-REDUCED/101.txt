Although the singularity of experience has no assignable beginning or end, it does pass thresholds, arriving unbidden into a context, then settling in and no sooner slipping out to seek ingress elsewhere. Its traveling across thresholds from situation to situation may prove to have a periodicity, which if followed provides a more ample expression of its self-activity. Upon that expression a speculative narrative can be built. The narrative is “speculative” because even though the ambulation it follows exhibits a periodic consistency, at each departure the singularity disappears into itself, into its own pure activity (uncontextualized and inter-situational). The next arrival is always across the threshold of that subjective indeterminacy. This makes thoroughly reliable prediction impossible. It is the philosopher’s job to tell the story of that impossibility.
