It is called style. Style is what makes the player. What makes a player a star is more than perfection of technique. Technical perfection merely makes a player most competent. To technical perfection the star adds something extra. Perhaps a way of catching the eye of players on the opposite team to make them self-conscious and throw them off. Perhaps a feint added to every kick. Or an imperceptible spin. Little extras. Small but effective ways of skewing the potential movements composing the field. The star player is one who modifies expected mechanisms of channeling field-potential. The star plays against the rules. But not by breaking them. He plays around them, adding minute, unregulated contingencies to the charged mix. She adds "free" variations: "free" in the sense of modulatory actions unregulated or unsubsumed by the rules of the game. A star style is always a provocation to the referee, who must scrutinize and judge barely tangible extras that are very little separately, but as disproportionately effective channelings of potential add up to an advantage. If the provocation goes too far, new rules need to be invented to subsume the modulaton devices. An example, from a different sport, is the invention of styles of power-serving in tennis that have brought the sport to the verge of crisis--a crisis of boredom at one-shot vollies--and has led to calls for a reform of the sport. The crisis was the result in the 1970s and 1980s of the confrontation between two individual star styles going by the names McEnroe and Borg.
