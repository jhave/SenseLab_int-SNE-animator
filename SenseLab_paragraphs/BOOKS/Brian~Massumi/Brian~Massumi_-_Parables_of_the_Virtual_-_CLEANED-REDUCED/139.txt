The proprioceptive dimension of experience was described as just one of two experiential dimensions. But the two were also described as folding into each other. Is not that folding of the Euclidean and non-Euclidean into and out of each other itself understandable only in topological terms? Is not the hinge-dimension between quantitative and qualitative space itself a topological hyperfigure? The non-Euclidean, qualitative, and dynamic always has one up on the Euclidean, quantitative and static. Simply because to put the two together you have to make a move, you have to fold experience back on itself, have to twist one of its dimensions into the other and cross-reference them both to that operation. This means that all spatialization is operatively encompassed by movement--from which it derives in the first non-place.
