The problem is that if the body were in all and only in the present, it would be all and only what it is. Nothing is all and only what it is. A body present is in a dissolve: out of what it is just ceasing to be, into what will already have become by the time it registers that something has happened. The present smudges the past and the future. It is more like a doppler effect than a point: a movement that registers its arrival as an echo of its having just past. The past and future resonate in the present. Together: as a dopplered will-have-been registering in the instant as a unity of movement. The past and future are in continuity with each other, in a moving-through-the-present: in transition.
