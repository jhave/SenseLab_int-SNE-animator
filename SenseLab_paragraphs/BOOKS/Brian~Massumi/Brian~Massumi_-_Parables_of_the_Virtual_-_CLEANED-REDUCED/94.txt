Under  the circumstances, however, the experimenter and the subject do not stand in the same relation to “blue.” There is an asymmetry in their relation to the word, due to the asymmetry of their respective stances in the laboratory context. Language is playing a primarily standardizing function only for the experimenter. For the subject, it is primarily operating as a trigger--for affect and memory. So what Katz has staged is a co-functioning of language, affect and memory. From his stance as experimenter, this complex co-functioning appears simply as a one-to-one correspondence (or lack thereof) between a present test patch and a past perception. Katz hasn’t reduced experience to another level, for example physiology or the physics of light. But he has extracted a simplicity from a complexity of experience. He has extracted a narrow correspondence-effect from a more encompassing asymmetry. What he has done is perform a reduction of experience operating on the level of experience itself. This kind of endo-reduction of experience might be argued to characterize the Gestalt approach to experimentation, of which Katz was an important forerunner.
