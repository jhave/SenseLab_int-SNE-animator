It is worth paying close attention to how synesthetes describe their “maps.” The biograms are usually perceived as occupying the otherwise empty and dimensionless plane between the eyes and objects in the world. This liminal non-place has been characterized as “peri-personal.” It lies at the border of what we think of as internal, personal space and external, public space. The appearance of the biogram is borderline in time as well. It is accompanied by a feeling of “portentous” déjà vu: an already-past pregnant with futurity, in present perception.vii This makes experiencing the biograms, in the words of one synesthete, dubbed MP in the literature, like “seeing time in space” (wouldn’t that be a good way of describing an event?). They have a feeling of thickness or depth to them, like a “flexible moving 3 dimension.” But the depthlikeness is vague enough that they can still be likened to diaphanous “slides” projected on an invisible screen. They retain a surface character. The “maps” MP draws at the researcher’s request do not satisfy her. Her biograms are not plainly visible forms. They are more-than visual. They are event-perceptions combining senses, tenses, and dimensions on a single surface. Since they are not themselves visual representations, they cannot be accurately representated in mono-sense visual form. Oddly, although they appear in front and in the midst of things, the biograms are “larger than my visual range, like looking at the horizon.” They are geometrically strange: a foreground-surround, like a trick center twisting into an all-encompassing periphery. They are uncontainable either in the present moment or in Euclidean space, which they instead encompass: strange horizon.
