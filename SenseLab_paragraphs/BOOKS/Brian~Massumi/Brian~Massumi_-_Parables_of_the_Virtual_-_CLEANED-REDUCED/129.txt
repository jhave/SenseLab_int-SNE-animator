Close your eyes and try to make your way to the fridge. Your visual memory of the rooms and the configurations of the furniture will start to fade within seconds. But chances are you will “intuitively” find your way to the food with relatively little difficulty. Especially if you’re begining to get hungry. Orienting by habit is more like intuitively homing in on the food with your eyes closed than it is like reading a map. If you think about it, we all go about most of our everyday lives on habitual auto-pilot, driven by half-conscious tendencies  gnawing at us gently like mild urban hungers. Something, it appears, is rotten on the shelf of spatial-experience theory. Cognitive maps, built on the visual basis of generic three-dimensional forms in Euclidean geometric configurations, aren’t all that they are advertised to be. As a general explanation of orientation, they are past their use-by date. The way we orient is more like a tropism (tendency plus habit) than a cognition (visual form plus configuration).
