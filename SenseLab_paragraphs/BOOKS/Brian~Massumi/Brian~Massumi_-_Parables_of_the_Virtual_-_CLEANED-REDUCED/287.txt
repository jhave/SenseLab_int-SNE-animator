AT POLES as virtual, as enveloping trajectories: 
"the electromagnetic field in empty space is a thing possessing an autonomous physical reality, independent of all substance."--H. Weyl, Philo. of Math & the Natural Sciences, Princeton, 1949, p. 172. Quoted in Balibar, Einstein 1905, p. 120. Also, note p. 121: in quantum field theory, "the field is in fact defined not as a function of the coordinates, but as a set of "generalized coordinates." (here, would say "abstract"). (quotes again from Weyl). (the field is space, as more-than-three dimensional--each "coordinate" being a dimension--3D being a substantialized reduction of that multi-dimensionality, which includes language and cs as much as "things"--for how would a quantum packet distinguish whether a modulation was language-triggered?
