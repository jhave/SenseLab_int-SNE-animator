Due to the peculiar nature of the fractal dimensionality, the pore-population is also invocable as a whole. The invocational conversion of this virtual community into a potential whole creates the conditions of emergence for a next State. The belonging to  be effected through the new State does not preexist. The people to come is defined only negatively by the State. In its own terms, it is fractalized, a continuum of variation (plotted by such axes as "pure" or intermarried ethnicity, more or less traditional, more or less religious or belonging to different religions, darker or lighter of complexion, more or less educated, richer or poorer ...). Each part of the fractalized continuum is in actual or potential connection with every other part. But the continuum does not add up to a whole. Positive differentiations between tendencies within the population emphasize themselves. Being a fissured continuum of variation, the population has no precise boundaries. It fades off vaguely, beyond thresholds of intermarriage or traditional practice or complexion. Until the State negation takes root. Proto-State identity--the sensation of belonging together as a general class of people rather than a complexly differentiated population extending across several axes of variation--identity is the form that State negation imposes on the victimized population. That form is retained when its sign is converted from the negative to the positive. Identity is the residue of oppression deposited in bodies in struggle. Identity is recognizability by or as a State. It is the State Idea applied to the humanoid body.
