Although the event-dimension of potential is in-between, it is in no sense a hybrid or mixture. It is inseparable from, and irreducible to, the collection of substantial and already-abstracted elements through whose inductive, catalytic and transductive mixing its potential is released and reconfigured. The field of potential is the effect of the contingent intermixing of elements, but is logically and ontologically distinct from them. In itself, it is composed not of parts or terms in relation, but of modulations, local modifications of potential that globally reconfigure. The field of potential is exterior to the elements or terms in play, but is not inside something other than the potential it is. It is immanent. It is the immanence of the substantial elements of the mix to their own continual modulation. The field of immanence is not the elements in mixture. It is their becoming. In becoming is belonging.
