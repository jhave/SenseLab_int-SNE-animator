The supplemental fusion-effect that can be cross-referenced-out for present purposes belongs to a second experiential infinity. Every virtual gnat of awareness will have potentially modulated every other, if ever so slightly, actually or not. Thus there co-subsists with the swarm of potential forms/configurations an infinity of qualitative relational differences. This second virtual infinity is infinitely larger than the first, since each member of the cloud of discreteness potentially has an infinity of microperceptions to smudge with, and each smudge can smudge again, indefinitely. The relational infinity is not only larger than the first, discrete infinity, but also differs in nature. It is composed of productive interferences, or in-between effects. Accordingly, it comprises a continuity of transitions rather than a collection of discrete elements. It is differentiated as a continuous variation.
