State-relations only occur through a step-down into part- to part- event channeling, a rising up of a plane of immanence. A State can continue to function as a substantial term in extrinsic relation only by circuiting into a field of immanence. This is true of all State body-elements. Indeed, it is true of all body elements, whatever individual they compose. Intrinsic-extrinsic relationality is a phase-shift of an immanent relationality that is one with its communicability and changeability.
