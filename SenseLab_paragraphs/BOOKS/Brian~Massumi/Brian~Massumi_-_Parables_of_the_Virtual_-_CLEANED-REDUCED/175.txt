The Argument from Change. We tend to think of our bodies as being contained in a three-dimensional space that like in some kind of box. Things are in the boxed present, which skips along from moment to moment, as from one point on a line to the next. The past is simply a point somewhere behind on the line, and the future is just a point ahead. Past and future are just presents in succession. Nothing exists outside of the march of the present.
