The only way to sort it out is to posit a double system of reference, each of which effectively envelops an experiential infinity. Each recursive duration must be posited as leading to a discrete awareness. Except that only a very few of the teeming swarm actually make it to awareness. The others subsist nonconsciously. These are Leibniz’s infinitesimally “small perceptions,” each a monad unto itself.xvi In other words, the bulk of discrete perceptions and cognitions remain virtual. Our lived experience swims in an infinite cloud of infinitesimal monadic awarenesses: micro-awarenesses without the actual awareness; gnats of potential experience.
