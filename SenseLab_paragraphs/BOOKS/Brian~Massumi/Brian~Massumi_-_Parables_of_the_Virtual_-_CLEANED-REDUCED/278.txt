Now we are in a position to return to "culture" and "society." It was something of an exaggeration to say that they have no body. It is more accurate to say that their only embodiment is in linguistic signs. Terms for collective agency are examples of virtual poles with no self-standing field of potential. Language is their only ground. They have no other standing. They are purely abstract tendencies in search of an event-space to call their own. The ultimate power of language is to transmit virtualities without their having potentialized in any other field of immanence, or having actualized in an associated milieu. Language short-circuits becoming. Up to now, the potential and the actual have been presented as coming to singular expression in sensation, which diverges into general-particular expression in language. The agonistic embrace of the singular and the general-particular, in mutual supplementation, expressed itself in turn as evolutionary drift. Language, however, can create virtual "objects" that double no substantializable terms. The usage of these signs is doubled by otherwise disembodied sensations and intensifications (fictional meanings, words with no substance or referential "content," but with modulatory effect due to their resonance with substantializations already stockpiled in the body). With usage, they may take on a periodicity that starts to self-compose an abstract event-space for them. For example, a genre of writing or speech. From there, they may migrate outside of language, perhaps into a discipline or movement that gives them the beginnings of a substantial event-space. That event-space does not resemble what the name means. For example, the discipline of sociology does not resemble "society." The event-space is an associated milieu  framing the circulation and repetition of the name, not the event-space of its self-standing or self-reference.
