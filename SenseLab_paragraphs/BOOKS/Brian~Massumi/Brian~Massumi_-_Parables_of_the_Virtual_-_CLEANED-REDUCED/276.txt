Like "subject" and "object," real fictions of historical progression and causality are necessary as well as fictional. If "resistance" or reform can make State regulation more equitable and inclusive, it is no small accomplishment. For many people, it is a matter of survival. That history is a power language expressing possibilities is precisely what makes it a necessary tool. The potential and the virtual are by nature unpalatable to the Static, even though it is destined to stagger along with them. Possibility it can deal with. The point of narrating the narrations of history as containments and resistant or reformist counter-containments is not to condemn them as a moralistic gesture. It is simply to point out that in addition to the historical determination of possibilities, there is trans-historical openness--the self-recursion of the present. Becoming-backwards. Becoming staggers history, and history hobbles becoming. The retrospective-prospective (linear progress) is in co-conditioning embrace with the self-recursive (the suspended destiny of the open field of the actual, potentialized by virtual poles with reference to which charged directional movements are mapped, even though they are never on the map, being points of arrival that are in unflagging displacement: pure futurities occupying the zero-degree of the present, the fissures and spacings of its folding back upon itself in continual self-variation).
