Whether ethics, at vacuum-bottom, is ever of the "self" in anything approximating its usual sense is something that is called into question by the work of Nietzsche (from whom Foucault borrowed the distinction between morality and ethics) and the work of Deleuze. That ethics is self-recursive says only that it involves practices of self-reference (the process of the folding back upon itself of the event)--not that it takes "the" self, as an empirically existing term, as its "object." History, as ethics, is not an empirical discipline. Rather, like science and religion, it is a pragmatics of potential. Its "true" "object" is incorporeal ("true" progress: another attractor state that cannot exist).
