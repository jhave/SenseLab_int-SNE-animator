Once again, these are pragmatic rather than critical issues. It’s question of appropriate technology. Choosing a geometry to design with is to choose potential modulations not only of the designed form but, through its device, of people’s lives. It was not the purpose of this essay to suggest particular design methods, esthetics, or “ideal” end effects. It was only to suggest that new paths might be found by letting go of the sterile opposition between the abstract and the concrete, and its fellow-traveller, the subjective and objective. To do this, it is necessary to take another look at perception and lived experience, and even broach such tired topics as consciousness. The fear that this will inevitably fall into a domesticating, self-satisfied subjectivism-in-spite-of-itself, like that preached by phenomenological architecture, is not justified. All you need to do to avoid that path is, quoting Deleuze and Guattari: look only at the movements.xxiv It has been suggested that extending the concept of the diagram into the “biogram” might be a vector worth pursuing. Formal topologies are not enough. The biogram is a lived topological event. It is onto-topological. It is the event of experience folding back on itself for its own furtherance, its continuing becoming. Onto-topological means ontogenetic. The biogram is experience reaccessing its powers of emergence, for more effect. It is the perceptual equivalent of lifting oneself up by the bootstraps.
