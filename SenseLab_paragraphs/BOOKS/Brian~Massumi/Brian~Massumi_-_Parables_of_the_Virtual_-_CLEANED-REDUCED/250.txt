Terms like "subject," "object," and "agency" are useful shorthand for indexing the polarity of the perceptual field. They are at any rate always in operation, shiftily if not with pride of place. This does not by any means always block thought. In fact, it introduces an element of linguistic vagueness necessary for theorization (which might be considered to involve a general-particular slowing of thought rather than its outright blockage). Thought continues, provided that devices are eventually found to convey relationality. After all, "subject" and "object" and "agency" are necessary, spontaneous unfoldings from relationality. They are real fictions, indexed to the reality of becoming by processual-perceptual derivation.
