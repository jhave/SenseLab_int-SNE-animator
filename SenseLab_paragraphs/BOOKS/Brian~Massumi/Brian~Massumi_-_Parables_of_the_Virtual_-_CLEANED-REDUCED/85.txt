“He once described to me how he got into politics by accident,” says a former senior Administration official. “He told me he told someone, ‘By God, what am I doing in politics? The kinds of things I’ve done so far are far away from this. But then I thought that a substantial part of the political thing is acting and role playing and I know how to do that. So I used to worry, but I don’t any­more.’”xix
There he goes again. Repeating lines: “he told me he told someone.” Ventriloquizing himself. Still at it after all those years. Reagan not only did not let go of the technologies of making seeming being; he did nothing to hide them. His spectacular political success in fact hinged on making seeming being visible. Reaganism is the regime of the visibility of seeming being. Reagan’s professional crippledom, his entry into public life, was the exem­plary event allowing the population of an entire nation to develop emotions and ideas along those same lines. As political actor, he catalyzed processes already at work in society. He was the Great Inducer, the national actor-cum-stage director who called a country to action in pursuit of the lofty lure of post-war unity. The amputa­tion written into the script was the “wound” of Vietnam. The all-too-visible rig was TV.
