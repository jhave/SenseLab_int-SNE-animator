That must be it. The paucity of visual cues in tunnel-like places like corridors and subways requires a back-up system to take over from the usual way of orienting: using visible forms grouped into fixed configurations to make what psychologists call cognitive maps. I had a happy ride. Until I thought about how I got there. My memory of getting from the exit of the building to the subway stop just moments before was virtually blank. Not quite (not again): twists and turns in rhythm. I had been on autopilot again. I had gotten to the train by habit--and it was my proprioceptive system of reference that seemed to be the habitual one, window or tunnel, vista or no vista. Clear visual images of forms in mapped configurations now seemed the exception. Landmarks I remembered. Sporadically. Rising into the light from rhythms of movement, as from an unseen ground of orientation, in flux.
