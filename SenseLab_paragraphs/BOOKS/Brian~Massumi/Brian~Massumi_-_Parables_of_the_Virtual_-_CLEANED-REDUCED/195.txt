The arguments presented in this essay all make the same point: that the life of the body, its lived experience, cannot be understood without reference to abstract-real processual dimensions. These cannot be contained in Euclidean space and linear time. They must be topologically described, using an array of concepts specially honed for the task: continuous variation, intensive movement, transpositionality, event, durational space, recursive-duration, modulation, biogram, feedback of higher functions, to name just a few.
