This is also where topological architecture is carnally challenged and proves inadequately abstract. It does well with the involuntary, in the form of chance variations programmed into the topological form-generating software. It does much less well with the elicited. Putting the two together is necessary for grasping the minded body’s mode of reality, which can be evoked by any number of necessary oxymorons: modulated self-decision; creative receptivity; induced self-activity; laboriously orienting autopilot; ever-present lapse. No single logic, geometric or otherwise, is flexible enough to encompass the concrete-abstractness of experience in all its ins and outs. Just as the body lives between dimensions, designing for it requires operating between logics. To be sufficiently abstract, topological architecture needs to welcome the translogical. A translogic is different from a metalogic. It doesn’t stand back and describe the way multiple logics and the operative levels they model hold-together. It enters the relations, and tweaks as many as it can to get a sense of what may come. It is pragmatic. It enters the fabric of transition, and pulls as many strands as it can to see what emerges. It is effective. Rather than metalogical, it is supermodulatory.
