But there are other ways of approaching the situation than bare-braining it. For one thing, you could try to think it. Again, you could resituate the factoid in its encompassing co-functioning, and ask what that co-functioning demands or allows one to think. The question is no longer whether the “fact” is truly a fact, or how it might profitably become one. The question bears on the encompassing co-functioning from which the fact or factoid, such as it is, was generated. In other words, what is at stake is no longer factuality and its profitability but rather relation and its genitivity. The question is: what new thoughts does this nexus of productively experienced relation make it possible to think? This is a philosophical question. This is the positive problem of the philosopher. Included in it is the further question: under what circumstances and to what effect might that new-thought relationality and genitivity be extracted from this nexus of experience and inserted into others, variationally? That is the pragmatic problem of the philosopher (or the pragmatic moment of the philosopher’s positive problem). In this second moment philosophical method segues into ethics and politics, just as scientific method relays in periodic fashion into technique and its capitalization.
