The traditional explanation of this phenomenon has been that “higher” cortical functions were damaged, but that “lower” functions embedded deeper in the “reptilian” brain were still intact. This convenient interpretation was shattered by the discovery that people with blind-sight can also virtually read. This was demonstrated in patients who were partially blindsighted but retained a reduced field of normal vision. The experimenter would flash a word with more than one meaning in the sighted field. Then a word associated with one of its meanings would be presented in the blind field. For example, “bank” would be flash into sight, followed by a flash of either “money” or “river” in blindsight. It was found that the word presented to the patients’ blindness would color their interpretation of the word they could see.xviii An unconscious perception involving highly developed cognitive skills was modulating conscious awareness. A practiced meaning had become a nonconscious perception capable of positively coloring the conscious production of more meaning (interpretation). This loop between “primitive” perception and “higher” cognition has been observed in undamaged brain function. One of the most startling findings has been that a single neuron is capable of recognizing a face.
