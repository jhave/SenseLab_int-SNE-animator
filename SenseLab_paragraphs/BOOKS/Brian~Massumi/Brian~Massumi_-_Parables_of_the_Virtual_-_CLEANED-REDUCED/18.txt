In other words, the half-second is missed not because it is empty, but because it is overfull, in excess of the actually-performed action and of its ascribed meaning. Will and consciousness are subtractive. They are limitative, derived functions which reduce a complexity too rich to be functionally expressed. It should be noted in particular that during the mysterious half-second, what we think of as “free,” “higher” functions, such as volition, are apparently being performed by autonomic, bodily reactions occuring in the brain but outside consciousness, and between brain and finger, but prior to action and expression. The formation of a volition is necessarily accompanied and aided by cognitive functions. Perhaps the snowman researchers of the first story couldn’t find cognition because they were looking for it in the wrong place – in the “mind,” rather than in the body they were monitoring.
