Synesthesia is considered the norm for infantile perception. The theory is that it becomes so habitual as to fall out of perception in the “normal” course of growing up. It is thought to persist as a nonconscious underpinning of all subsequent perception, as if the objects and scenes we see are all “threads” pulled by habit from a biogrammatic fabric of existence.x The biogram recedes to the background of vision. Unremarked, it continues to operate. It is the mode of being of the intersensory hinge-dimension. Its strange one-sided topology is the general plane of cross-reference not only for sights, sounds, touches, tastes, smells, proprioceptions, but also for numbers, letters, words, even patches of grammar. On that plane, the learned forms that are usually thought of as restricted to a “higher” cultural plane rebecome perceptions. Practice becomes perception. The cognitive model has it that “higher” forms are associative compounds built up from smaller sights and sounds as from elementary building blocks. But the workings of synesthesia impy that the higher forms feed back to the “lower” perceptual level. They enter the general dissolve, on a level with the elementary, fused into the surface, interwoven components of the fabric of life. This makes it impossible to apply to “raw” experience distinctions such as “higher” and “lower,” “perceptual” and “cognitive,” or even “natural” and “cultural.” There is no “raw” experience. Every experience takes place in the already-taken place of higher and lower, where they join for the future. Every experience is a portentous déjà vu at a hinge.
