A thing cannot be understood without reference to the non-present dimensions it compresses and varyingly expresses in continuity. The formula is by now familiar: these dimensions are abstract yet real. They are virtual. Logics of presence or position that box things in three-dimensional space strung out along a time line just donâ€™t doppler. Logics of transition are needed: qualitative topologics.
