Two of the greatest mysteries of cosmology are questions every child asks: if the universe is everything, then whatâ€™s it in? and, where was the world before the big bang and how long was it there? The first question is a logical consequence of the assumption that space is Euclidean, like a box-frame containing things. The second is an equally logical consequence of the assumption that time is a line with a beginning and end, running through or alongside space. It is clear that no glimmer of a solution is possible working with these assumptions. Some recent scientific efforts to solve these cosmically childlike questions have gone so far as to suggest topological models where space loops so twistedly that it ends up back in time. For example, the outer edge of the universe might not be an edge at all, but a recursion where the limits of space loop back to the irruption of time. There, at the big bang, space will have folded back out.
