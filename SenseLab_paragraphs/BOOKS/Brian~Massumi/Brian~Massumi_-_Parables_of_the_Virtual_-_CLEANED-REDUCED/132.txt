The way landmarks function in the actual course of orientation is very different from reading a map. They are what you habitually head for or away from. In other words, they trigger headings. Vectors. Landmarks are like magnetic poles that vectorize the space of orientation. A landmark is a minimal visual cue functioning to polarize movement’s relation to itself in a way that allows us habitually to flow with preferential heading. The vectorial structuring effected by landmarks give the space of orientation a qualitative dimension, expressed in tropistic preference. The cognitive model assumes that visual cues are somehow used to calculate distances, as if our brains were computers pre-programmed in inches and feet. Isn’t it more plausible instead that our bodies are habituated in steps? And that steps relate more directly to other steps than they do to conventional feet? The computational fiction is a natural outgrowth of the assumption that we effectively move through and live in a static, metric or quantitative, Euclidean space. I for one don’t count my way around town. A qualitative space of moving, step-by-step self-reference accords better with my navigationally competent (if at times cognitively challenged) sense of where I am.
