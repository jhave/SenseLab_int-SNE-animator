Bergson could profitably be read together with Spinoza. One of Spinoza’s basic definitions of affect is an “affection (in other words an impingement upon) the body, and at the same time the idea of the affection.” This starts sounding suspiciously Bergsonian if it is noted that the body, when impinged upon, is described by Spinoza as being in state of passional suspension in which it exists more outside of itself, more in the abstracted action of the impinging thing and the abstracted context of that action, than within itself; and if it is noted that the idea in question is not only not conscious but is not in the first instance in the “mind.”
