You could say that this is bad science, and dismiss it out of hand. Or, you could say that it is proto-science or perhaps semi-science, and ask what precisely it semi-did and proto-how. For Katz’s procedure does constitute a kind of empirical investigation, and it did generate a repeatable result with some claim to factuality. The semi-fact is: under these circumstances, a match does not take place. What does the generation of this factoid allow one to think about the co-functioning of language, memory, affect, asymmetrical social relations, lived complexity, and produced simplicity? If you resituate the factoid in that encompassing co-functioning, the stakes change. The problem for the traditional scientist would be how to convert the factoid into a full-fledged fact: to verify it. This would involve purifying the experiment of uncontrolled variables. Language, affect, and social position would have to be neutralized to the greatest extent possible. In other words, ways would have to be found to make memory and color perception approach the physiological limit of bare brain-functioning. This is a more severe reduction than Katz’s. It is no doubt possible to carry out, and would quite possibly yield something of value, perhaps to neurophysiology, which down the line might in turn prove profitable, for example, to medicine, by supplementing its diagnostic or therapeutic techniques.
