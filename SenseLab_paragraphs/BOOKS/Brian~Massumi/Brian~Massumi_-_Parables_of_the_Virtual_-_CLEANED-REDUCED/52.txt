Fast-forward, mid-paragraph, to 1965, the writing present of the now experienced actor on the cusp of a spectacularly improbable political career. Poised for the campaign for the governorship of California that was to set him on the road to the White House, and apparently no more comfortable with writing than reading, he is co-authoring his first autobiography. One of its primary functions is to explain how half a lifetime as a bad actor actually qualified him for high office, contrary to the then public perception that the roles of entertainer and governor were fundamentally incompat­ible. He couches his explana­tion in terms of a shocking deficiency in movie acting that can only be overcome in the public arena.
