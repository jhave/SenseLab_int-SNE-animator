It isn’t really that simple. As an uncontrolled experiment, unaccounted for variables entered in. All of the things Katz asked to be color-matched were intimate everyday objects, and could thus be expected to be charged with layers of interest and affect. What was being tested, then, was less memory than the co-functioning of affect with memory. Further, Katz assumed that language was operating neutrally. The word “blue” is assumed to play the role of a transparent designator of what two particular things have in common, a pair of eyes in the world at large and a test patch in the laboratory. Language is assumed to be a medium of commonality, in two senses. First, in the sense that it is posited to harbor a generality capable of effectively subsuming two particulars. Second, in the sense that the experimenter and the subject are assumed to have equal access to its operations of neutrality, or to stand in the same relation to “blue” as deployed in the laboratory. The word is used by the experimenter to stage a match or mismatch. The role Katz assigned to language is standardizing: to deploy and guarantee a standard of comparison in order to test a response against it.
