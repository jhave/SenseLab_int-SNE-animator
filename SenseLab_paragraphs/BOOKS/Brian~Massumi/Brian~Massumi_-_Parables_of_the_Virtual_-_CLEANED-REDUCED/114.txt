The “too” of the blue expressed something besides gluey-ness: an “absolute striking color-particularity” or singularity. Objectively, color is traditionally said to comprise three dimensions: brightness, saturation, and hue. Each time Katz asked one of his experimental subjects to make a match, one of these dimensions pushed itself so forcibly into experience that it falsified the match. The test patch chosen by the subjects must have matched, or in some way stand for, their triggered memory. But if held up to the retina, hat, lip, or brick to which the context demanded it to be attributed, it didn’t match. The memory was an experience-patch of a different color than the verifiable attribute.
