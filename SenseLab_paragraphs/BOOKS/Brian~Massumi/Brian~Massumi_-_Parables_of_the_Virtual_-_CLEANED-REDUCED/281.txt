A singular-generic term for collective agency is the being in language of a people yet to come [Deleuze and Guattari CITE] (as opposed to its being for language). It is a virtual people whose world or event-space has yet to compose itself. The invocation is messianically addressed to an already-constituted set of individuals apt to serve as a host population for the coming event, donating their corporeality and their persons to serve as the germinative soil of the incipient event: its event-space. What will that event-space be when it grows up?
