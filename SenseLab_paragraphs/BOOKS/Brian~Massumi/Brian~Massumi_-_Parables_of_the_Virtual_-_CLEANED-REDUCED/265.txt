The specificity of religion, for better or for worse, is to consciously assert the super-empirical nature of force. What distinguishes religion from science is not epistemological ("superstition" versus "knowledge"). Both are technologies of intensification and force. The super-empirical nature of force has only been scientifically recognized in the West in certain currents of physics (quantum physics and far-from equilibrium thermodynamics), medecine (under the rubric of the "psychosomatic," a concept in dire need of overhaul), and more recently in evolutionary biology (neo-Darwinians testing notions of "directed mutation," "hypermutability," and other responses to environmental variation that are not themselves selective, even if they do not contravene natural selection). Consciously or not, the distinction between science and religion is pragmatic and tendential: what divergent collective regimes of sensation do with their cumulative capture of force, and in what direction their doing takes them. And "us": how it becomes us,  how it transforms humanoid belonging. "Cyborg" and "born-again" (or otherwise divine) are the most attractive poles of the day.
