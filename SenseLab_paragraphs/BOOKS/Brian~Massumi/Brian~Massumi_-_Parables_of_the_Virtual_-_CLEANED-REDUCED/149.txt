The relevant distinction is between involuntary and elicited. In “normal” perception, biograms emerge involuntarily and operate unawares. In clinical synesthesia, they have an odd status: they are “involuntary and elicited.”xi They retain the surprise of the déjà vu even though they can be summoned forth and consciously navigated with future heading. Eliciting with future heading is not the same as willing. Biograms remain their own creatures, with a peri-personal autonomy from psychological or cognitive containment. They cannot be entirely owned personally, since they emerge from and return to a collective darkness. But they can be tamed, induced to appear and perform feats of memory. They are less like a static image on a slide screen than a live circus act, performed in a ring that lies stage-center and encircles the tent.
	
The clinical synesthete has trained synesthesia, harnessing habitual intersense-connection for conscious memory use. Vision is typically used as a plane of general cross-reference. It is on the abstract surface of color that everything fuses, in way allowing a single thread to be pulled back out as needed, before returning to the fold. All the other senses, and any and every “higher” form, are gathered into color, together with the three dimensions of space and the three dimensions of time. It is as if all the dimensions of experience were compressed into vision. This is why the topology of the biogram is so strangely twisted. It is not due to any lack, say of cognitive organization or of Euclidean accuracy. There are simply too may dimensions of reality compressed into vision. It can’t hold them all in discrete, determinate, harmonious form and configuration. It buckles under the existential pressure.
