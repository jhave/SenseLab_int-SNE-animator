Architects do not have to choose between the two systems of reference, as if one is more real than the other. The challenge is to design for both simultaneously: to build discrete forms in functional configurations, but in ways that newly reaccess the infinities of experiential potential, discrete and continuous, from which they were extracted. Building for the historically positioned here-and-now is to be satisfied with too little: a gnat of design. The challenge is to build also for the recursive duration. To see discretely in present time and determinate space--but also to “see time in space,” necessarily more vaguely (and creatively), in modulating relation.
