Point 3 loops back to 1 on the issue of abstraction. The whole series of objections, which is just a sampling from comments heard at lectures and conferences, pivots on the widely accepted idea that the abstractness of the computerized space of topology contradicts the spatial reality of bodies and buildings. Point 2 assumes this gap between the concreteness of bodies-in-buildings and the abstraction of design method, and demands its redress. The lines are drawn. Bodies versus Lynnian “blobs.”
