Topological architectsâ€™ responses to body-positive objections have been hesitant, if not evasive. This essay will suggest a possible path for a response. It is unlikely, however, to offer much comfort for partisans of concreteness incarnate. The argument will be that the space of the body is really abstract in a way that cannot be conceptualized in other than topological terms. But this will not leave topological architecture off the meat-hook. For it will also be argued that the new architectures have a way to go before they can claim to effectively build for that abstract bodily reality. The problem, it will appear, is that computer-assisted architecture is not abstract enough. The lines need redrawing. Bodies and blobs.
