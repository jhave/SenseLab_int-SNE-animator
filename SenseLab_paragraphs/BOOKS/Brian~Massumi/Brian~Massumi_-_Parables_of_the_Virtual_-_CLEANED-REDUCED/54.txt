This deceptively complex statement does not condemn acting wholesale, for example on the grounds that it traffics in fakery, substituting appear­ance for reality. In fact, it implies that there is power in acting, which is faulted not for the kind of process it sets in motion but rather for its inability to take that process far enough to realize the power inherent in it. The process in question is seeing. A seeing of oneself. Specifi­cally, a seeing of oneself as others see one. The problem with acting isn’t that it carries the actor out of himself, out of his character into another, out of his real self into a false double; it is that it doesn’t take the actor far enough outside of himself. The movie actor’s success hinges on his ability to see himself as others see him, but this is circumvented by what Reagan calls “mental pictures.” These are private images the actor forms of the character he is portraying, developed from the script. The actor makes words into images, visualizes text, then renders that visualization public by embodying it before the camera. Watching the rushes is a jolt for Reagan precisely because he recognizes himself on the screen. “There you are,” “just plain old everday you.”
