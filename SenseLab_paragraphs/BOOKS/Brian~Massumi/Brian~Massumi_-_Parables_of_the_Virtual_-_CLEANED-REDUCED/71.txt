Call the closing of Reagan’s eyes as he sees himself at the pitch of panic and exhaustion movement-vision. It is a vision that passes into the body, and through it to another space. Call that infra-empirical space, what the blind-sight of movement-vision sees, the body without an image. The body without an image is an accumulation of relative perspectives and the passages between them, an additive space of utter receptivity retaining and combining past movements, in intensity, extracted from their actual terms. It is less a space in the empirical sense than a gap in space that is also a suspension of the normal unfolding of time. Still, it can be understood as having a spatio­temporal order of its own.
