Corroboration for this has been found in studies of “blind-sight.” Blind-sight is nonconscious visual perception usually due to brain injury. A person with blind-sight may consider themselves totally blind. Put an object in front of them, and they will insist that they see nothing. But if you ask them to reach out for the object, their hands go straight toward it and their fingers open exactly the right amount to grasp it. They do see, but nonconsciously. Their visual awareness remains virtual. (The success of their grasping stands as a testament to the effective reality of the virtual.)
