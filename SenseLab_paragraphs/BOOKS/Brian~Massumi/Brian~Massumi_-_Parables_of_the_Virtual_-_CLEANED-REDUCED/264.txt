The super-empirical nature of force necessitates a thorough reworking of the concept of cause. The linear connection between cause and effect as qualitatively different terms in extrinsic relation must be supplemented by a non-linear "immanent causality" in which everything that happens is the expressive effect of a remix of the already-effected. "Cause" would then be a selective (framed) reactivation or reiteration of stockpiled effect. Sampling. Reality self-sampling. The most sensible model for immanent causality is autocatalysis: self-arising differentiation triggered by positive feedback, or systemic self-recursion (additive divergence between spontaneously arising, co-conditioning ontological levels, whose self-recursive divergence defines a global field of open-ended tendency).
