Since the ball is nothing without the continuum of potential it doubles; since its effect is dependent on the physical presence of a multiplicity of other bodies and objects of various kinds; since the parameters of its actions are regulated by the application of rules; for all these reasons we will call the catalytic object-sign a part-subject. The part-subject catalyzes the play as a whole, but is not itself a whole. It attracts and arrays the players, defining their effective role in the game, and the overall state of the game at any given moment, by the potential movement of the players with respect to it. The ball moves the players. The player is the object of the ball. True, the player kicks the ball. But the ball must be considered in some way an autonomous actor because the global game-effects its displacements produce can be produced by no other game element. When the ball moves, the whole game moves with it. Its displacement is more than a local movement: it is a global event.
