There is another way to think this. There has recently been what we might simply call a return of the world. This is a world beyond, if still at times working within, the (more than) human (Erin Manning 2015). This world exceeds the reach of even the extended technics of the human. The “return” to this world is found for example in climate change and other environmental challenges, and has always been accepted in process philosophy and other philosophies tending towards the ecological. It is also found in the increasing acceptance that plants have sophisticated modes of “communication”, and of social networking and action. Such a “return” of the world was also anticipated by Whitehead, in his idea of the “world as a medium for the transmission of influences”, for the vector transmission of feeling.
