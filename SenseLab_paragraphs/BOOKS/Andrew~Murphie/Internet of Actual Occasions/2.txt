Proposition 1: Following on from the emerging Internet of things, someone recently proposed an “Internet of nano-things”. Is this going too far? Maybe this isn’t going far enough. Or maybe this is the wrong question. Now that we can, in very different ways—via technics, via micropolitics, via metaphysics—seem to get near to the very basis of events, what can/should we do? This proposition concerns that which has until now been known, and thought, as “media”, “communication”, “networks”, “algorithms” and related concepts/technics. Start with this speculative-pragmatic proposition: let us assume that we can go as far as possible, that an “internet of actual occasions” is possible. How would it work? Would it be desirable? If we could, should we use it? What difference would it make to think with it, work with it, organize in partnership with it? Do we, in reality, already have it? Is it called the world “as medium for the transmission of influences”, as discussed by the under-recognized media and communications thinker, Alfred North Whitehead? If it is already “there”, what would it’s relationship be to (more-than-)human-designed technics?
