What is now happening at the juncture between these two; the “mediated” becoming-environmental of power and the world as medium? Or, to move away from the bifurcation of the mediating and the mediated (which becomes a “trifurcation” etc up to n-1), what precisely is this juncture itself, where both have to be considered at once, as on the same plane? How might we approach this juncture with the rigor of attention to immanence it needs (Manning 2015)?
