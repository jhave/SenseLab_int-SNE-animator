Juncture: Something like “media”, “communication”, “networks”, “algorithms” and related concepts/technics have been at the heart of power during the last hundred years. A great deal has followed from this (in philosophy, education, management, politics, economics, social organisation and more). These concepts/technics have always been contested. Yet they have also, in practice, long produced interventions in worlds that are many and major. Thus they perform a particular and important speculative pragmatics. In mainstream culture certain versions of these concepts/technics could even now be said to be “protected” concepts/technics. This protection is almost of a religious order, in that many of these concepts.concepts have become fundamental articles and rituals of a secular faith (Shannon & Weaver, cognitivism, etc). The culture energised by this “faith” has been a large factor in what Brian Massumi has discussed as a “becoming-environmental of power” (Ontopower), via the extension of media and communications into more of “world”, and in finer gradations of intervention in “world”, in “bare life” (Massumi), in geontology (Povinelli) and more. This is largely an ecologically destructive extension of power with no limit to it’s appetite (if the “internet of actual occasions” was a real technical possibility there could be little doubt that it would be quickly colonized as a new site for power). Yet what, really, are communication, media, computing, networks, algorithms? In concept? As ongoing propositions in varieties of speculative pragmatics? As designed technics? As themselves imperfect refractions of world?
