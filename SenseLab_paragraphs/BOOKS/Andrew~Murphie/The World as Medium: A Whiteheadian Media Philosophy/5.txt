The first elements of this assemblage are the moving, and one assumes thinking, feeling worms. These worms are literally “premediated,” as Richard Grusin puts it (Grusin 2011). Their neurons have been tampered with by optogenetics. The second element of this assemblage is this optogenetics, a true “biomedia” (Thacker 2004). Far from being just “non-invasive,” however, the use of optogenetics in the experiment involves an inventive and very troubling mix of the “non-invasive” and the highly invasive. Optogenetics in this case involves the use of genetics to sensitize the worms’ neurons to light. The experiment can then allow two things. Light can be used to control the worms’ neurons (and therefore worm experience, feeling and movement). The neurons can also be made to respond to light in a way that makes them more trackable and/or recordable. The third aspect of this assemblage is a kind of idiosyncratic virtual reality system. The system can respond very quickly and precisely as it tracks its inhabitants (in this case worms with optogenetically adjusted neurons). It can then stimulate particular neurons at particular points in space, even as the worms move. It tracks the worms, “by linking optogenetic photostimulation of sensory neurons to the x-y position of the tracking target with great precision” (Faumont et. al 2011). This allows the system to create constantly adjusting virtual environmental effects; a kind of responsive, 3D world. Virtual environmental effects induced include “chemical or thermal gradients…food patches…[and] virtually textured environments,” created “in ways that transcend” the usual low level of the “ability to manipulate physical properties of the environment on the scale of microns and milliseconds.” As one blogger puts it, “If you know your worm neurons, you can stimulate one [to] make it think it has suddenly touched something with its nose or that the environment is suddenly very salty” (The Cellular Scale 2012).
