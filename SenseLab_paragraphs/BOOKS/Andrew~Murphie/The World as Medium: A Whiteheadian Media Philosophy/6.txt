The induced 3D effects involved are obviously not quite the same as those found in a 3D VR world inside a headset such as Oculus Rift. One very significant difference is that the experiment involves a direct technical intervention within the wider world—one in which neuronal s(t)imulation intersects with the worms’ movement through the physical environment. In this, such an experiment is also a technical intervention at the point at which micro (neurons) meets macro (worm perception, worm thought, worm and world). If the result is a little like a low level worm “cyberspace,” this is a cyberspace blended through the regular physical reality of worms.3 Using this media assemblage the scientists were able to make images of particular neurons at high levels of magnification as the worms moved through their physically-technically affected and systematized environment.
