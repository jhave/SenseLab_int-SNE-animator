The third point about data as potential for feeling is that data as any kind of ordering is only so relationally (although this also means differentially, with “relation” as contrast or intensity). Order—intrinsic order within an event and social order between events—is made and remade in events themselves. Order is formed (and unformed) when data meets data and intensities are distributed, whether this involves a series of signal events of patterned changes in voltage in a computer, or sunlight meeting the eye/skin/nervous system—or perhaps all of these together, as mimicked and modulated in the experiment with worms. Thus data as ordered is only ever fully ordered immanently (in fact, this immanent ordering of feeling is the event). Further, as above with data, any kind of ordering is always accompanied by a novelty within and disruption to existing order, although this destruction is not of course total. In short, as events form and dissolve, “information” is not preserved and neither the “message” nor world involved remain the same. In coming together with other events of feeling in media-world events, data itself is transformed—simply put, its order is constantly corrupted.
