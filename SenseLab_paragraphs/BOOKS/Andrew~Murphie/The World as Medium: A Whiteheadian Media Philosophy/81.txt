This may be what we have to deal with, beyond, before and perhaps after what are still important issues of representation, rights and so on. We are confronted by, in fact we are, an extremely complex web, not even syntactically certain, of vectors of the transmission of feeling, shifting contrasts, of differential life in the world as medium. If it appears that this suggests some wild, “Deleuzean” celebration of difference, this is the case, although the situation is complex. Taking the “world as medium” seriously means accepting that difference and wildness are unavoidable and should be embraced, if with sobriety. This is also just as much a question, given the complex political situation of the world, of realising “what we’re up against.” What we’re up against is not the world, but our own differential passaging with it.
