The second point about data—now considered as potential for feeling—is related to this. The politics of data-based media is not only a question of what is being recorded and how events are being represented and put to use in distant, broader networks—that is, of data travelling outwards from events and being used for a kind of representation of general populations and individual movements, elsewhere (in some security silo or corporate bunker). Such a politics is also a question of what data events—as potentials for feeling—are travelling into other events, taking their more immanent and immediate part in events. This applies to every occasion of immediation along the way (thus allowing a rethinking of, for example, social media, political communication and so on).
