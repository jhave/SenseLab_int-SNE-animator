Here Stavning Thomsen turns to Lazzarato’s remark that it is “no longer quite simply about an image that is going to be seen but about an image in which you interfere. …” (Lazzarato 2002: 79).30 It is not too far from this to the optogenetically activated worms having their neural signals monitored as they participate in the creation of virtual environments—in which case it is not only an image in which other aspects of the world as medium can interfere, but a kind of “image” that you become, among other images (as Bergson thought it). The contemporary signaletic image increasingly aligns itself with the world as medium, which is to say a mesh of signals or interwoven vector transmissions of feeling. This suggests something of an impersonal matrix of forces driving media and communications, notably but not only within media arts, to catch up with the full potential of signal and world, with “each actual world,” “as a medium for the transmission of influences” (Whitehead 1978: 284).
