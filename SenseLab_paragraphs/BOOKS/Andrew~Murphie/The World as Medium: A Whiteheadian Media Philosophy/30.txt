Composed of such becomings, Whitehead’s world is one of worlds, plural, and of course every occasion is its own world. As Whitehead puts it: “each actual entity arises out of its own peculiar actual world,” with “each actual world as a medium” (1978: 284). Any of these worlds is a medium for the transmission of vectors of feeling and the ongoing transmissions and gatherings of transmissions of all worlds make up the “world” as a whole.
