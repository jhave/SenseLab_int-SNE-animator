In order to approach this situation, I will shortly discuss Alfred North Whitehead’s media theory—that is, his own media theory as much as the way his philosophy might contribute to other media theories. This will be based on his concept of the “world as a medium.” First, however, I will begin discussing these media-world assemblages by suggesting three things about how the data involved can be thought as the basis for contemporary media-world assemblages of all kinds.
