Think feeling here in the Whiteheadian sense, as propulsor to experience, always in the realm of the impersonal. This is not human feeling or emotion. It is affective tonality. It is the generative force [we might say the gathering of intensities], singular to this event, that moves the event toward its resolution. Each event has a tone, a singular expressivity, an enjoyment, as Whitehead would say. (2013: 20-21)
