Yet Whitehead has a somewhat broader concept of the vector than that of basic mathematics, by which I mean that of a mono-directional line with a particular force. For Whitehead, vector simply “means definite transmission from elsewhere” (116). Whitehead also mentions “vector transference” (xxv), “vector transition” (164), and “vector feeling” (163)25.
