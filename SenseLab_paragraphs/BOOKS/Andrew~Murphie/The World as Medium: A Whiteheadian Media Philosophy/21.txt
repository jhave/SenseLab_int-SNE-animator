This chapter seeks to address such questions by rethinking media and communications in the light of Whitehead’s thinking. It does this via one of Whitehead’s less explicitly discussed ideas, that “the world can be conceived as a medium for the transmission of influences” (1978: 286). This idea is arguably central to Whitehead’s process “philosophy of organism” (1978: 18).10 Taking the world as medium seriously would radicalize, and is radicalizing, both thinking and working with media and communications. It provides a different and powerful way to understand all world/media relations—past, present and future. Mediation and communication come to be understood as a general condition of the world, although neither world nor media remain the objects/processes with which we are familiar. Much is therefore at stake, as those defined objects/processes not only underpin current media industries and established academic disciplines. They also underpin any number of other “ecologies of practice” (Stengers 2002: 262) that depend on models and practices drawn from media and communications industries and disciplines, from education to management to psychology to much of contemporary science. Indeed, Christopher Vitale suggests that the concept of the world as a medium is “the starting place which perhaps can serve as the foundation for a new paradigm within the realm of contemporary thought” (2009: unpaginated).
