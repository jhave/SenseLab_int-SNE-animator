Let’s take this a little further. We are used to the idea, whether or not we agree with it, that things are not the solid entities or objects we take them for. They are really a coming together of relations. Our concept of “things” is misplaced, involving what Whitehead calls “misplaced concreteness” (1985: 72). Whitehead goes further than this however. Relations are often taken to be smooth in some sense (for example smooth relations, often taken to be more “authentic,” are the aim of much of communications studies and industry). Yet relations are not smooth. As suggested earlier, they are not even relations. When we think relations we are still being too abstract. For Whitehead, “what are ordinarily termed ‘relations’ are abstractions from contrasts” (Whitehead 1978: 228).
