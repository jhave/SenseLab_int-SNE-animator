Shortly I will take up Whitehead’s “media theory” to explore the way in which Whitehead’s thinking gives a philosophical groundless ground for understanding contemporary media events as participants in a broader world—a world that is itself a series of events of mediation and communication. There will only be the space to sketch elements of Whitehead’s philosophy, seen from the perspective of the world as medium. This will lead to a consideration of signal, so basic to media and communications, and to Whitehead’s own version of signal. In Whitehead’s thinking, signals would take their place as the vectors for the transmission of feeling (e.g. 1978: 163 & 315) that are so important to his world as medium.
