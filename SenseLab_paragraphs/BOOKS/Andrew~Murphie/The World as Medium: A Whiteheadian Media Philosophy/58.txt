Affect is the power to immerse within this—for one gathering of differential intensities to be affected by, and affect other intensities without totally falling apart.29 This affective power is the onto-genetic power that holds the ongoing creation of world—or something like Whitehead’s “organism”—together. Another word for this shifting intensity, thought in tandem with affective power, might be signal.
