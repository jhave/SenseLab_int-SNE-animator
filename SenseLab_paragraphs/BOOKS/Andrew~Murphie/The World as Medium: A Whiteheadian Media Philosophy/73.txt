How do these heterogeneous series come together? They communicate, but not as we usually think communication. They literally come together via feeling, which is also to say signal. An example is the dark precursor, the channel that forms in the air that precedes and makes the path for a flash of lightning. Both dark precursor and lightning are a feeling out of events in ground and sky by each other. Both involve gatherings of prehensions that lead to a series of actual occasions. Communication as we usually think it—messages or even information—is a side effect, at best a perspective on the formation of channels of feeling in actual occasions. Indeed, Sean Watson has suggested that communication is primarily “a matter of structural modulation of the body and nervous system” (1998:38). Whitehead and Deleuze suggest something similar, but with regard to the “nervous system” of the broader world. Signal is a structural modulation of the world’s own self-feeling or perception, via an ongoing communication between heterogeneous series. Signal is thus found everywhere, and at all scales, down to the level of the ongoing genesis of channels in the “dark precursors” by which the world gathers the elements of its own microperception. Within this, Whitehead understands the “human body” as a kind of signal transducer or modulator for world, “…as a complex ‘amplifier’—to use the language of the technology of electromagnetism” (1978: 119). To summarise all this, signal is contrast in motion. All a sign is is an instant of gathering/tension within signal. It is a perspective on signal. Any sign is thus an actual occasion or gathering of actual occasions.
