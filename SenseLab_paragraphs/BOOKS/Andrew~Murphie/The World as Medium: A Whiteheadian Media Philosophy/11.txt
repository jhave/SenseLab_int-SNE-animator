The momentum of this work carries through a series of events passing varying data to other times and places. The question of powers6 from this perspective involves thinking in terms of participation in something like a pulsing or phasing between events of emergence and perishing (Massumi 2015b:154-155). This is again something basic to the technology of signal and signal processing, which is in turn basic to media and communications. Yet along with such basic technical powers of what we usually consider signal, there are other powers, also “signaletic” in a broader sense. In short, the powers found in any event are multiple (powers of worms, neurons, experimenters, light, genetics, “saltiness,” gravity, the earth, etc). They might sometimes even include, if in diminished form, aspects of that which we sometimes still call the “human.”
