There are three main concerns when it comes to thinking media and communications with Whitehead. First, there is of course attending to Whitehead’s little remarked upon concept of the world as medium. Second, in the light of this we can suggest that Whitehead himself provides a comprehensive “media theory,” one that resituates media and communications as part of the world, indeed as world. Media and communications are no longer viewed as one slice of world somehow different from the larger, supposedly non-media, non-communicating part of it.  Third, there is little doubt that Whitehead’s ideas have extensively influenced thinking about, and practices in, media and communications, in often unacknowledged yet very fundamental ways over the past hundred years.11 Moreover, his thought is currently seeing a revival in thinking about media and communications, as it has elsewhere.12 Some of the details of this third point are dealt with in two extended footnotes.
