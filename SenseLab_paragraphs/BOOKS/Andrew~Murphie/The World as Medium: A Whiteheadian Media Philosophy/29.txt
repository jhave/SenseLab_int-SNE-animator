For Whitehead, the world as medium is indeed one of the vector transmission of feeling. In its process of becoming, one emerging actual entity or actual occasion feels a number of immediately previous entities. It “prehends” them—feels them from the perspective of that occasion’s gathering of prehensions into its own becoming. This can only be serial. That is, an occasion can only prehend another occasion as a kind of past or futurity (or potential).16 The other actual occasions prehended by an occasion, however, might also feel or prehend each other separately (though again, somewhat serially). Thus what an actual occasion “A” feels at any given time is a combination of both direct and relayed feelings or prehensions17 (from B, C, D, etc.) (Whitehead 1978: 226).18 Over time in this complex relay of feeling any “former entity”19 becomes “data for the latter” (that is, in a feeling or prehension). As discussed earlier in this chapter, what Whitehead means by “Data” “are the potentials for feeling” (88). Whitehead also calls these potentials for feeling “objects.” Of course, “the initial data of a complex feeling, as mere data, are many” (230). However, this is “felt [as though] they are one in the objective unity of a pattern” (231)20. As the becoming of an actual occasions proceeds, there is eventually what Whitehead describes as a “fully clothed feeling whereby the datum is absorbed into the subjective satisfaction—‘clothed’ with the various elements of its ‘subjective form’ ” (1978: 52).
