In sum, in Whitehead’s process philosophy, data, that is, the objectification of previous actual occasions as potentials for feeling in the shifting extensive continuum as a whole, are felt and drawn into what Whitehead calls a concrescence of becoming24—that is they are prehended (grasped and gathered). This concrescence finds satisfaction in an ongoing series of new, fully achieved actual entities or actual occasions. Actual occasions are therefore complex gatherings of real/potential world(s), moving as world in and of vectors of transmission of feeling. “Satisfaction,” however, will mean the end of any particular actual occasion, although aspects of it will be taken up (differentially) in prehensions for other actual occasions.
