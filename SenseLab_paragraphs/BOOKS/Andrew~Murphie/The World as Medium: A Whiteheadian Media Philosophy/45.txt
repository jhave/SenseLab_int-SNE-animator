Indeed, in this complexity of signal at the level of world, there is no “bifurcation in nature.” The so-called bifurcation of nature was something Whitehead diagnosed as at the root of many problems (Whitehead 2007: 26ff). Only one aspect of this bifurcation was the working assumption that human perception was of one kind of nature, and the world beyond it another. For Whitehead, however, perception is a part of the world, and not of a different nature. More generally, he insisted that there are not two separate parts of nature, usually taken to be nature apprehending—thought or perception—on the one hand, and nature apprehended—a supposedly less active “material” world—on the other. In a different context Whitehead refers to this as the difference between “nature alive” and “nature lifeless.” Here the more specific versions of this bifurcation would be nature mediating and nature mediated, or nature communicating and nature communicated. Yet if the world is medium then so are media and communications world. There is not a world that is then mediated by something other than world, or some subset of world. Everything is nature alive. We must therefore be able to account for an ongoing mix of signal events of all types (matter, thinking, perceiving, feeling, modeling, movements, electronics, the weather) in intermixed ontogenetic terms.
