I have suggested earlier in this chapter and elsewhere that impulses towards an acceptance of something like Whitehead’s concept of the world as a medium are in fact found in some of the dynamics of contemporary media (Murphie 2004, 2014). As I began writing this chapter, the Occupy movement in Hong Kong was using meshwork technology (specifically the FireChat App) to reorder communications, away from the established and controllable internet, in order to hold together a series of actual occasions within a world, intending to bend that world away from its current formations. You can also see this in philosophy, which has made a return to “ecology” in many ways. We are beginning to see this accepted, very reluctantly, but nevertheless insistently, in a politics that is for example besieged by climate change, and can no longer refuse the world as a medium in which we are immersed (although I would define politics now as precisely this tension between two different ideas of the world as medium—something like Whitehead’s world as medium versus the “becoming-environmental of power”).
