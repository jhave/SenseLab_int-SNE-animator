The worm-optogenetics-VR assemblage is an emblematic contemporary media assemblage. It has a degree of “self-awareness” about the power of the potential for feeling in making the world. Unhappily though, in this the worm-optogenics-VR assemblage provides a perfect technical diagram for contemporary control. It is a big step up from Bentham’s (Foucault’s) Panopticon toward a more effective society of control, or perhaps a step up again from that. It is at the same time “non-invasive” and invasive in the extreme. It partners a very effective form of surveillance with control at the very root of movement/perception/thought. It creates fabulations that nevertheless become material aspects of the world, additives to the world as it would otherwise have been. These are fictive but no less real, responsive aspects of world. They systematize worlds and adapt and change in real time with these worlds. Such systems allow a highly fluid trapping and immanent control of any creatures—including but not restricted to humans—that both move and think at the same time. Approaches to media and communications need to be able to analyze such situations. Yet what is mediating what in such set ups?
