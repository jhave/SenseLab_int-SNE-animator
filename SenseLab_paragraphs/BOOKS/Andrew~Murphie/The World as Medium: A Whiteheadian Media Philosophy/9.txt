First, data is not only, in any simple way at least, what it is too often still thought to be. Data is not, in any simple way at least, a question of information representing events, relayed clearly and faithfully from elsewhere, via mediation.4 Rather, as with the worms, data is always in the middle of things, contagious and highly vulnerable to contagion. This means data is messy. One better way to think data in this messiness or shifting complexity is in Whitehead’s terms—data as “potentials for feeling” (88). In his terms data is not really a simple record of previous events. It is rather like a moment in a compressed and heavily modulated series of recordings and re-recordings. Each recording is in some ways faithful and in others completely not. “Information” in these terms becomes a matter of carrying some aspects of the intensity of past events through the series. Of course, any data carries its own intensive relations with, and of, other data. However, in a Whiteheadian approach to media, data can only carry intensities in so far as these intensities have been able to constantly replenish and re-activate themselves through a series of immanent presents, at all moments in the processes involved. Data then is the bringing of these intensities as potentials for feeling directly into events (the VR modified experience of worms). Yet of course the events themselves can also be considered data in Whitehead’s terms. They come to carry their own potentials for feeling, in the present, and into the future (neurons meet worm mobility meets optogenetic stimulation, meet scientists, with each their different potentials for feeling, moving into the future).
