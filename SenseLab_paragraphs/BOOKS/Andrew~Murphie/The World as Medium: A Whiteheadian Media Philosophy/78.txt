If we have, this foundation is a groundless ground. Signals are slippery, changelings by nature. They are (topological) border zones (of differential contrast and tension), “fields of transduction” (Fritsch and Brunner 2011). Signal is always “signal processing,” rather than anything like symbolic computation (or, symbolic processing is really just a form of signal processing). Signals constantly change the signaletic fields through which they move, and on which they depend, a variation from within which they are (Murphie 2002). In this respect, in their intensive contrasts, signals might be a matter of “co-emergence in differentiation” (see Bertelsen 2004 on Bracha Ettinger). Nothing is neatly sent, travels and arrives, or certainly not in any neat order. Or, a signal is more often travelling than sent or arrived. Or, more accurately it is always sent, arriving and travelling at the same time—immediated and immediating.
