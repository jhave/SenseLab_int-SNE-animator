Intensity always involves a differential of energies or forces. (As we shall see, Whitehead terms this a “contrast” [1978: 228]). Forces and energies as a kind of moving flow of difference are intensities. This flow creates specificities through time, like whirlpools—gatherings together of intensities (feelings, prehensions) into events or actual occasions. Think of a glance across a crowded room. Or think of the gathering and movement of voltage within power lines or computing, and, in conjunction with this, of electromagetic waves in wifi, or light within the fibreoptic cable, that enable networks. Think of a body moving through, with and as moving world—as worlding. Think of the weather. Think of a thought: poised at the junction of the flow/capture of intensities or prehensions moving between general vectors of feeling as world, our body’s own movement through this, and the ongoing drift of electro-chemical signal complexity in the brain. All of these are themselves made up of further actual occasions. For example, the brain involves billions of actual occasions—instances of the world as medium—at any given moment. The practical reality of the brain is that there is a constant redistribution, within the brain itself, of proprioceptive feeling—neuronal gatherings of intensities or prehensions. These lead, for example, to the constant changing of relative strength of connection in neurons (Kandel 2007), just as larger scale proprioception leads to changing relations between muscles and so on in the body. Thinking is literally feeling. Thinking involves—though it is not reduced to—a basic and literal flow of proprioceptive intensities of the brain—the brain as world as medium feeling itself differentiating.
