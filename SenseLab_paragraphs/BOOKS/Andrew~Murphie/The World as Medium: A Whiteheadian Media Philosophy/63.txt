In this context media and communications, not only as carriers of signal intensities but as assemblages of signal intensities themselves, head towards what I call elsewhere “differential media,” and “differential life” (Murphie 2014, 2005). Differential media is a term that understands media as ontogenetic, and only secondarily if at all as a series of discrete media forms. It is media moving with the possibilities of variability and intensity. It is media considered as amodal, the ambivalently modal, or the precariously complex modal, rather than simply the “multi-modal.” It is individual media instances accommodating themselves to being no more than temporary gatherings within the broader dynamics of the world as a medium. Differential media are differential first because they are involved in media events that are active participants in the self-creation of the world. Their force is not in their newness per se, but in their powers of ongoing differentiation. This gives them a great flexibility—one that resonates within the broader world (as itself medium). And this resonance gives media as we usually think of them their ability to participate in the rest of the world’s ongoing differentiation.
