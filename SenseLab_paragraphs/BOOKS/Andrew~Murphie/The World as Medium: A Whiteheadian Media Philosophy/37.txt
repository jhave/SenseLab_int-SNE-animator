This flow of actual occasions is also the flow of experience. The gathering of concrescence is the “togetherness of experience … of its own kind, explicable by reference to nothing else” (1978: 189). This is not just a question of human experience but of any subject-“superject.” All the world is therefore capable of experience (see Shaviro 2014), with “any actual entity at once the subject experiencing and the superject of its experiences” (Whitehead 1978: 29). At the same time, the subject here is not the subject as we usually think of it, something perhaps somewhat separate from the world at large. It is rather something like the world itself as it begins to head towards an actual occasion, begins to take on the particular form (the “subjective form”) of an actual occasion. What then is an object? As Whitehead puts it “the word ‘object’ thus means an entity which is a potentiality for being a component in feeling; and the word ‘subject’ means the entity constituted by the process of feeling, and including this process” (88). What he calls the “superject” is the end result of an actual occasion—its satisfaction. The superject is therefore something that “emerges from the world” (88). Whitehead opposes it to the Kantian subject, from which the world supposedly emerges.
