Some significant shifts are needed in order to go with the world as medium (and not just philosophically but in what Massumi calls a “speculative pragmatism” [2011: 29ff]). The main shift involves being better able to remain with signal as feeling. To put this slightly differently, it involves being able to remain with signal as differential intensity, without immediately retreating to an impoverished concept of information (and usually of signal, which is reduced to mere carrier). This is something perhaps understood by any mathematician, electrical engineer, jazz musician, activist or even perhaps cyberneticist. I will tease this out.
