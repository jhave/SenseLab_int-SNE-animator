In the light of this understanding of relation as contrast, what might seem Whitehead’s actual occasions’ “relationality” has to be qualified. What is really meant by “relations” is a gathering together, maintenance and creation of new contrasts—differential intensities. We can begin to understand why the world as medium is not a world of “ideas” per se, or even things or objects and subjects, at least not first up. It is instead a world of feeling, of intensity, of the differential. In this world, signal is feeling (intensity of contrast, whether found in the differentials that produce voltage and its variations or a cold wind on the skin). Indeed, we can define signal as feeling in movement, which is to say the world in movement, which is to say the world communicating/contrasting itself as it creates itself. All this is made absolutely clear by our poor optogenetically activated worms.
