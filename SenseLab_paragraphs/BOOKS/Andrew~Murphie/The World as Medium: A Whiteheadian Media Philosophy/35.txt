Arising from and moving through the specific instances of unique actual occasions, in the transmission of vectors of feeling, is a different aspect of the world as medium. This is shifting potentiality. Whitehead calls this the “extensive continuum” (1978: 66).22 This is like Deleuze’s “virtual.”23 It “expresses the solidarity of all possible standpoints throughout the whole process of the world” (Whitehead 1978: 66, my emphasis). It is “the reality of what is potential, in its character of a real component of what is actual” (my emphasis). More simply, the extensive continuum is the abstract “potentiality for division” (67). Like Deleuze’s virtual it is actualised, here by further actual occasions that again and again “atomize the extensive continuum” as they gather prehensions, or vector transmissions of feeling, in their own unique way.
