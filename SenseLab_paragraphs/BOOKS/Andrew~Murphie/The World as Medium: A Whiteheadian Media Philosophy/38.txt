Through all this the world as medium is fundamental in that “the vector character of prehension is fundamental” (317). This lies at the heart of Whitehead’s philosophy of organism and what he calls his critique of pure feeling. Indeed, Whitehead simply states that “All things are vectors” (1978: 309, my emphasis). This means the “displacement of static stuff by the notion of fluent energy.” It means ongoing productive relations between different aspects of this fluent energy. It also means that everything involves vector transmission—fluent and relational. Everything is a kind of immanent process of (im)mediation or, in a very basic sense, communication.
