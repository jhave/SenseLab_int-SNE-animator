If so, perhaps it is time, without completely abandoning everything we know about and do with media, to let go of many of our framings and disciplinary field limits, along with foundational concepts of processes and objects. In so far as we continue to inhabit dominant conceptions of media and communications, we might need, once again, to rethink “media and mediation as conceptual objects in their own right … whether or not there is even such a thing as a media object” (Galloway, Thacker and Wark 2013: 1-6). When discussing the affective intensity that is also central to Whitehead’s “critique of pure feeling” (113),14 Massumi even suggests that we might not even “need a concept of mediation,” even if affective intensity “includes very elaborated functions like language” (Massumi in Massumi and Zournazi 2002: 214-215). One way of responding to such provocations is indeed to accept all the world as medium, yet this requires us to develop new concepts of media and communication that do not separate them from a world that also mediates.15 This might require a more complex but also humble understanding of “our” media and communications in relation to the rest of what is happening in the world—a true “media ecology.” The entire world becomes a medium for the “vector transmission” of feeling. This is also a world that is constantly recreated as novelty is added with each coming together of what Whitehead calls “actual entities” or “actual occasions,” the “final real things of which the world is made up” (1978: 18).
