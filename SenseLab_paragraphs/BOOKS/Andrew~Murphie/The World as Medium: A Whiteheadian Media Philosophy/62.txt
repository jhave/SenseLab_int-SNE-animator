Again, at the heart of this is signal—the world as signal. Here, however, signal is not the carrier of message, but rather what Deleuze called a different/ciator (Deleuze 1994: 207ff). It is, at the same time, a bringing together of intensities in transit. This of course means that signals are not channels within a non-signal world, or channels between pre-existing worlds, but world itself. All the world—in fact worlds in plural—are transmission-worlds, an assemblage of signal intensities, in constant collision, cooperation and chaotic overlap with each other.
