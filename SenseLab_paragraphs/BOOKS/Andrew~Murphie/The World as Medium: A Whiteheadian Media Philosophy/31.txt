In this, any event or “actual” occasion is both extremely private and public. Even though entities form in a way that is, as Whitehead puts it, governed by an ideal of privacy and giving rise to what he calls “private emotion,” the “vector form is not lost, but is submerged …” (1978: 212). In fact, this “private” emotion can never be closed off to the more “public” vectors of feeling of the world as medium (and at that this emotion arises in entities that are not in any sense always or even often what we would call “human”).21 Here—  the reason why the origins are not lost in the private emotion is that there is no element in the universe capable of pure privacy … the notion of pure privacy [is] self-contradictory. Emotional feeling is still subject to the third metaphysical principle, that to be “something” is “to have the potentiality for acquiring real unity with other entities.” Hence, “to be a real component of an actual entity” is in some way to “realize this potentiality.” Thus “emotion” is “emotional feeling” and “what is felt” is the presupposed vector situation … the notion of “passing on” is more fundamental than that of a private individual fact.
