Recently scientists developed a way to “non-invasively” monitor the neural activity of worms as they moved (Faumont et. al 2011). This solved a longstanding problem involving experimental work with animals – how do you monitor such a tiny thing as a neuron in a free moving animal?2 The new method involves what can best be described as an elaborate media assemblage, although it’s not the kind that would usually be studied in media departments.
