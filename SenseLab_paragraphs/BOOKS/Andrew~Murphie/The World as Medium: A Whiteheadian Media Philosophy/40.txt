As Steven Shaviro puts it— Feeling, as such, is the primordial form of all relation and all communication … feeling can be conceived as vector transmission, as reference, and as repetition. These three determinations are closely intertwined. Every feeling involves a reference to another feeling. But reference moves along the line of the vector. Feeling as reference is a transmission through space, a direction of movement … every new process of becoming “involves repetition transformed into novel immediacy” (Whitehead, 1978:137). (Shaviro, 2012: 63)
