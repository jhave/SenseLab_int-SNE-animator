Deleuze describes signal as that which emerges when two or more of these heterogeneous series communicate (understood here as forming a new intensity or contrast): lightning as intensity between the series of the heavens and of the earth; voltage in a power line as electrical potential difference; weather and fossil fuel consumption (and other series) in climate change; tax and politics; or my body, events on the cinema screen, the bodies of others and popcorn in the cinema.
