Whitehead’s contrasts are like Deleuze’s differential intensities. They involve a kind of asymmetrical relation that is based on active contrast. Or, they involve a kind of non-relation in which active difference is the key. Blue is not white is not yellow is not green is not red and there is no easy communication or resolution between them. There is indeed a differential intensity within such contrasts. A contrast is not, however, an “opposition,” or “dialectic.” It does not have to be resolved. Whitehead points to the “contrast between blue and red” (1978: 228) [think of a Rothko painting with blue and red—No. 14 for example]. Although a contrast is not always a matter of a simple pair—contrasts can be multiple (229).
