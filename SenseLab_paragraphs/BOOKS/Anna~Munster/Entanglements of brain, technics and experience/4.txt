In a range of experiments that began in the 1970s using electroencephalograms to measure brain activity, Benjamin Libet proposed that the brain exhibits a ‘readiness potential’ of at least half a second before conscious awareness that an action or stimulus takes place. This measurement of ‘evoked potential’ is a sharp positive potential appearing in the appropriate sensory region of the brain about 25 milliseconds after a skin stimulus. Libet's experiments demonstrated that there is an automatic subjective referral of conscious experience backwards in time to this time marker.
