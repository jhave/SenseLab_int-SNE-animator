Take, for example, Google’s aspirations beyond its constitution as the ‘ultimate’ search engine. Its construction of and investment in ‘the future’ rests on its capacity to reterritorialise this proto-mind space. This reterritorialisation is attempted via a raft of machine learning techniques from data mining to dataset training, which claim to reveal dimensions of thought and behaviour. This move away from search per se toward prediction of what “users” desire before they even know what they want signals an insidious foray into the nonconscious and affective terrain of precognition and all its inbetweenness. Networked platforms and corporations thus turn toward systems, tools, and processes of what I call “neuroperception”; that is, a paradigm of perception that sees human thought and action emanating from the overlay of artificial neural networks on to our forming sensorium. This overlay stakes a claim to what are actually the indeterminate nonpredictive capacities of neurobiological processes. In neuroscience this nonpredictability is everywhere referred to as the brain’s plasticity. Yet plasticity is not the only facet of brains that make the neuroscience of thinking indeterminate: If you tap your finger on the table, you experience the event as occurring in “real time”. That is, you subjectively feel the touch occurring at the same time your finger makes contact with the table. But our experimental evidence strongly supports a surprising finding that is directly counter to our own intuition and feelings: The brain needs a relatively long period of appropriate activations, up to half a second, to elicit awareness of the event! Your conscious experience or awareness of your finger touching the table thus appears only after the brain activities have become adequate to produce the awareness ((Libet, 2004: 33)
