The increasingly mutable mixing and matching of audio, visual images and text, accompanied by the tactility of the touch screen and the kinesthesia of the interface, quite aside from any more insidious predictive technics, already changes the body’s perceptual posture, the brain’s activities and redistributes their actions in relation to the interface, as much as the interface distributes information. These considerations can no longer be considered extraneous or secondary; they are not “merely” contextual. They are inextricable from what media do today. The issue is not to find a way to rethink the brain in terms of languages of media or technical metaphors but to be better able to understand media themselves as already immediately entangled and lived assemblages. Media and technics might be better thought as media-events or technical-potentialities; not as outside us but in relation with us – a thinking immediated; a brain-screen (Deleuze, 2000: 366); a technics-in-motion. We require ecological approaches for articulating these relationalities.
