The actual nonlinearity and desubjectivation of networked, immediate events in which something might be felt or sensed but does not yet have an end point, determination or outcome, can not be tolerated by predictive techniques. The politics of control enters when predictive techniques invade and attempt to determine what is necessarily indeterminate and yet nonetheless is experienced immediately – nonsensuous, precognitive, perception. We should be careful not to imbricate recent neuroscientific findings within such a politics of control, in spite of the sometimes mechanistic and reductive modes of explaining what is ‘in’ the brain. If recent studies suggest that ‘the brain’ is already preparing to make a decision before that decision is consciously known, then it is the notion of consciousness itself that needs rethinking. What if consciousness were instead an immediate ‘event’ in which determinations from the past and tendings toward the future both made themselves felt as real? And yet the potential to differ were always, even if mirco-neurally, held on to as real as well?  Looking ‘in’ at the brain via neuroimaging techniques would then only be a realization of the backwards referral of sensory experience; just envisioned from the machinic perspective. For where the potential to differ is real, where this potential can actually transduce into something novel, where potentiality and nonlinearity co-habit, prediction arriving before the event’s occurrence is impossible.
