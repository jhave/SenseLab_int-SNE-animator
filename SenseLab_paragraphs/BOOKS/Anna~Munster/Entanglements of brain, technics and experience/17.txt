Immediation does not exclude determinations from the past or tendings toward the future. The term immediation is a way of drawing attention to the event as the primary unit of the real. The idea is that whatever is real makes itself felt in some way, and whatever makes itself felt has done so as part of an event. It has entered in some way into the immediacy of the moment as a factor in the event now taking place. (Massumi in Brunner, Massumi and Manning, 2013: 135)
