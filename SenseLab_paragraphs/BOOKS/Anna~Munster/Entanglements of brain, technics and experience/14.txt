What is different about platforms such as Google Glass, and indeed any predictive technologies, is that they modify the temporal ordering of immediated assemblages of technology, body and environment into linear sequences.  In so doing, they shape their ‘events’ into linear order; events here being simply things that happen relationally in and to bodies, brains, technics and their habitats. These kind of temporal inflections performed by predictive immedia are  ‘captures’; they are political because they bring force to bear on relations of presentness, pastness and futurity, and because such force harnesses us to a specific subjectivation reliant upon a proprietary platform. Predictive technologies necessitate an unfolding of temporality in which we become subjectively aware of the next product we want to buy, the next item we require more information about, the next restaurant we want to eat at, through a simultaneous backward referral or "antedating" of our sensory experience and a filling in of the temporal gap between desire (which is past) and consciousness (which is present) by the platform’s predictive capabilities. Predictive immediation rolls this gap in to a predicated future. The effect is that ‘we’ become conscious of what Google knows we already will desire.
