Fox Talbot was a component of – both engaged with larger machine flows and actualising through various techniques – the event of technical images. He became enmeshed with what was to become a new ‘diagram’ of visuality, co-extensive with the socio-historical field that, among a number of novel inventions, helped to create scientific photography. As I will argue, building on recent work that I have published on diagrammatic events and functions, especially as these unfold in a technical dimension (Munster, 2013: 28–30), a diagram is an abstract assemblage of relations. Abstractly, this relational assembling pulls together the conditions under which nonhuman and human elements conjoin, play out historically, and inflect across social, aesthetic, political (and more) registers. A diagram is also always open to and conditioned by an ‘outside’. Outside-in, yet crucial to its capacities to differentially transform, the diagram’s tensors are its potential to deform, explode, shift or inflect toward indeterminate conjunctions. Today that diagram, which once conditioned the event of the technical image and the experience of a photographically inflected visual perception, is undergoing palpable encounters with its outside, now exceeding what was within and resulting in new conjunctions. We are experiencing images that are no longer visual and visual perception becomes a process of composition that is fundamentally transmaterial and transmodal. The technical image is now diagrammatically traversed by an intensive interference that arrives from elsewhere.
