Interestingly though, a range of cross-media art practices are also engaged in loosening these imperatives rather than in shoring up the materiality of the artist’s presence in an immaterial informatic domain. Indeed some practices that specifically engage with the authoritative status of the scientific image amplify or intensify the transmaterial and transmedial relations permeating scientific imaging. This is a deliberate aesthetic strategy for unknotting the authoritative status within scientific imaging and needs to be tagged. Other aesthetic practices are concerned with the nonvisible but have displaced it, transversally, so that the dominance of the visual begins to fade. I will gesture toward some of these aesthetic practices in tandem with my unfolding of the above propositions about transformations to the scientific image. I hope to signal that a different aesthetic event – not movement or genre but more process – is emerging, which I will call ‘diagrammatic’. To be open to this aesthesia, we might have to re-orient entirely…away from the ‘visible’ per se toward something I will tentatively name the imperceptible. This is already coming into expression diagrammatically through the transversality of such cross-media artistic experiments.
