Throughout the corpus of his work, stretching back to the early 1980s, Rokeby has been interested in nonhuman vision systems especially infrared cameras and their potential to ‘survey’ an audience involuntarily (Baltan Laboratories, 2010). In thinking about such vision, he invokes the ancient Greek notion of the eyes beaming ‘rays of perception’ outward to the world rather than receiving images onto the retina. Additionally, he comments upon the design process of attributing sound behaviours to various zones in the room: ‘They were "painted" into the space by hand. Starting with an empty space, the artist placed the sounds in the space by selecting a sound then waving his hand in a particular area to locate the sound’ (Rokeby, 2010). Rokeby reconnects the optical via gesture to painting and its permeation by the haptic. This resonates too in participants’ experiences of the space as they reach into the ‘painted soundscape’ to ‘touch’ the invisible sculptural curves and dimensions. Furthermore, the title of the work refers to that ineffable, unknown astrophysical phenomenon, which can only be inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter.
