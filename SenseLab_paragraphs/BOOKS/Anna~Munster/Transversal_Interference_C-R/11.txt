I want to spend some time with these propositions, stepping through the ways in which each of these are unfolding in the domains of scientific and medical visualization. It is important to become ‘practically’ familiar with these monumental changes in the material and relational fabric of imaging today. It is important to gain a sense, especially, of the taken for granted transmateriality of the image and of interference patterns as foundational for images as they are produced throughout the sciences. Tracking both transmateriality and interference seems a necessary first step in tweaking or even resetting aesthetic strategies and tactics vis a vis the extent to which scientific images gain and hold authority as they circulate through aesthetic and cultural domains. If we take into account the shift I have signalled toward an optics of the invisible, along with the role of interference as diagnostic ordering, then we will inevitably also raise questions about the status and politics of whole areas of aesthetic endeavour such as ‘practices of ‘visualization’ and even ‘visual studies’. Much art-science and even much nonscientific contemporary discourse about the visual misconstrues a number of the directions taken by scientific imaging, taking, for example, ‘visualization’ to be one of science’s main aims. Concomitantly, aesthetic discourses come to adopt a program, which actually miss what the sciences might more radically offer. That is, they miss a kind of speculative imagistic trajectory that inhabits many visual scientific endeavours oriented toward a fading of visibility, indexicality and illustration as imperatives for the scientific image.
