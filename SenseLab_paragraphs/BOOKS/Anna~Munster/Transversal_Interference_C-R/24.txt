Put briefly, interference is a physical phenomenon where waves superimpose to form a resultant wave of greater or lower amplitude. Without spending too much time cataloguing and explaining the importance of this phenomenon for the production of a wide range of scientific images, I do want to note at least a few of these: astronomical interferometry (used in for example Very Large Array telescopes to increase the strength of the electromagnetic signal received), bio-layer interferometry, which I alluded to at the beginning of the talk, used in differential interference contrast microscopy to look at in vivo cell structure and development; interferometric techniques used in software to adjust imaging the motion-tracking of three-dimensional objects.
