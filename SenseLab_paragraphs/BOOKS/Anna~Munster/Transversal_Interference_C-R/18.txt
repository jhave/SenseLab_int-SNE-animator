Interestingly enough, though, Dark Matter does not reject the visual; we get a sense of this through its composition and design. Infrared video cameras are positioned within the gallery space at four points. They gather positional data based upon a software division and mapping of the space into thousands of three-dimensional zones. Rokeby has selected a range of these zones and has attributed sound behaviours to them. The data from the cameras is cross-referenced, calculating which zones are experiencing the greatest physical activity by participants at any given moment and then the installation plays the sounds linked to those zones throughout the speakers in the space. At both the level of the system hardware and at the level of artistic composition, Rokeby provides us with relations to visuality, all the while composing a work that is fundamentally nonvisual.
