Rokeby’s aesthetic invention of a diagram for a sonic-haptic space, which nonetheless holds itself in relation to the visual, is light years ahead at the level of a sociotechnical diagrammatic shift than the shift into invisibility optics currently gathering speed in scientific research. Research into ‘metamaterials’, for example, has intensified around phenomena such as invisibility cloaking (for example, see Leonhard, 2009: 537 – 538). Metamaterials are artificial materials that can only be described in terms of the system of relations that adhere between atomic or sub-atomic elements rather than the properties inherent or attributes of the materials themselves.. Some materials are characterised by their ‘periodic structures’ for example; that is, their system is formed through self-impositions of the material elements that generate displacements. Such displacements can exhibit optical properties not found naturally. An electromagnetic metamaterial affects electromagnetic waves by having structural features smaller than the wavelength of the respective electromagnetic wave. Metamaterials sit over or around an object, guiding or scattering electromagnetic waves around or away from it, creating an illusion or cloak of invisibility. Currently, experiments have only been successful with the microwave spectrum and at a very small scale so actual visible light invisibility is still some way off but researchers are hoping to break the light barrier soon.
