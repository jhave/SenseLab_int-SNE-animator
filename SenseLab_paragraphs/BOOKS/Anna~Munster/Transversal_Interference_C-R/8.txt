With this broader deformation and sense of the image’s aesthetic, sociotechnical diagramming and transformation in mind, I want to approach this newer ‘technical’ indexicality of the image now via a series of propositions. First, that the fabric of the image within scientific and medical arenas while seemingly abstracted from the natural world’s ‘pencil’ is nonetheless fundamentally transmedial and transmaterial. Second, that we are undergoing a seismic shift in optics, which cannot simply be understood chronologically as an historical shift from optico-chemical techniques of recording light’s properties to computational encoding. Rather the visual field itself is undergoing a re-orientation driven by sensing invisible phenomena. This is not captured by the common conception that the invisible is being made visible, as is often claimed when data visualisation is explained, lauded or marketed. Instead, invisibility itself has become an optical phenomenon within the domain of the visible. In turn, this suggests that optics has undergone radical and fundamental transmaterial, transmedial and amodal transformations. I want to spend some time grappling with at least some of the scientific aspects of such changes.
