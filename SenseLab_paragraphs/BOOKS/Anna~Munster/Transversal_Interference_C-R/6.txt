But if this interfering outside were somehow already insinuated in technical images (the interfering immanent materiality of those ‘sun-pictures themselves’), what does this say about the curious diagrammatic onotogenesis of technical images?  Although Fox Talbot’s phrase ‘the pencil of nature’ has become synonymous with an understanding of the indexical relation between the world and optical photographic processes, this phrase, at least in its usual indexical deployment and understanding, curiously elides these diagrammatic events conditioning images. Yet what we also sense from his after-insertion is something more direct that must be expressed: the page lit immediately by the sun image. Plates, which have the capacity to be materially affected by light travelling cosmically as both or either waves and particles; metal plates that, at a molecular level, have conjoined with the sun ‘itself’. And in this conjunction we have something novel, something gloriously aesthetic – albeit a nonhuman aesthetics – a base metal to cosmological directness of the photographic image, making a machine for expression without requiring the artist’s hand. Yet as is often argued, Fox Talbot’s ‘pencil of nature’ and photographic plates were intended to demonstrate the deep and objective coalescence between the new means for recording and making images and that new instrument of science, the photographic camera (Warner Marien, 2006: 30–2). What to do, what to say, about all this intensity, then, that seems to offer something more than objectivity yet not at all subjective?
