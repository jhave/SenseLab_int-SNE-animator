Physics, it can be surmised from this range of applications, conceives interference more generally as a phenomenon and then technique for generating a diverse range of scientific imaging from the mid-twentieth century onward.  Here interference is understood as pattern rather than as subversion or intervention. We need to at least take heed of this understanding if we are to seriously engage with the composition of the contemporary image. That does not imply simple acquiescence to the scientific framing of interference as orderly rather than ordering. In other words, we do not need to adopt the orderliness of pattern as the necessary value to be derived from interference phenomena. There is a tendency by both artists designing for interaction and in the current discourse around interactivity to want to resolve machinic or participatory interference phenomena in the direction of harmony or co-operation, that is, a kind of ’order’. To return to Dark Matter, for instance, Rokeby speculates that when multiple participants are present within the Dark Matter space, the cacophony of sound produced will lead to a situation where no one knows who or what is controlling the sound (Rokeby in THEMUSEUM: 2012). Rokeby speculates that order will emerge form this situation as a result of co-operative interaction between participants, who will te thend toward creation of a ‘resolved’, orderly, sound sculpture. Yet anyone who has watched participants engaged in artistic interactive installations will quickly note that co-operation is a learned behaviour not a naturally recurring result; chaos, surrender and sometimes futility are quite often more common.
