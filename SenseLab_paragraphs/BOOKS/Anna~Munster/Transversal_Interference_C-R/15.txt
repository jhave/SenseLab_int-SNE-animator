But the fMRI corralled into ‘demonstrating’ neural correlation of behavior has become rigidly indexical, losing the potential for the brain to again change in response to, for example, less exposure to media, exposure to noise in the street, a quick decision to not lie or just to change ad infinitum. It has instead actualized according to a regime of truth, which is held together by a particular diagram of power (Foucault: 1977: 205). A diagram   –and here I am following the concept of the diagram laid out by Michel Foucault, especially in his work on disciplinary societies – that continues to hold together the relations of force of our visual regime. These relations are co-extensive with an entire social field of securitization and control  – relations such as correlation, identification, visibility and so forth. What we need, then, is a way to perceive such neuro-images as part of that diagram of relations of force – relations that are co-extensive with a visual regime connected to securitization and control but also to sense that those relations are open to deformation.[4]
