Caught up with both these propositions are certain consequences for how artistic practices will need to strategically reposition themselves in this new domain of technical invisible phenomena. A common tactic of artistic intervention into data-based or data generated material has been to ‘interfere’ with the smooth encoding of the image, often by seeking to introduce, unearth or trigger corruption and/or noise within the data. If data generated images somehow suggest the presence of a perfectly functioning objective and scientific program or machine numerically crunching away, then the artist must bring the image back down to earth or so it goes: ‘Glitch art is process art: the artist’s hand intervening in digital data leaves its mark in the visual essence of the image.’ [3] Thus the image bears the trace of material aesthetic presence as an interference performed at the level of a ‘glitchy’ gesture. We seem to be in inverse Fox Talbot terrain: the data-generated image is so abstracted from the material world that now the artist’s body must materially intervene.
