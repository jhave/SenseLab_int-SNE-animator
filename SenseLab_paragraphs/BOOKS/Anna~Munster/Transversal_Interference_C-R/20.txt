Rokeby works to expand and dissipate the visual field in order to push us into an arena in which visuality loses its hitherto privileged status based in part on the socio-political anthropomorhism that holds between visuality and the hierarchy of the senses in human perception. In Rokeby’s installation, visuality becomes instead a field in flux: a property of the machine; something to be evoked in a transdisciplinary relational manner; and ultimately only inferable.  As we participate with Dark Matter, we come to inhabit a space in which by taking away visibility the visual field relaxes, taking on a more relational, diagrammatic feel where it can be modulated and inflected via multimodal and multisensorial deformations. This points to a really radical opening of contemporary aesthetics toward a direction quite different from that prescribed by, for example, a ‘visual culture approach’, which, despite its claims for interdisciplinarity, still argues for the determining role of the visual in the wider culture to which it belongs (Mirzoeff, 1999: 4).
