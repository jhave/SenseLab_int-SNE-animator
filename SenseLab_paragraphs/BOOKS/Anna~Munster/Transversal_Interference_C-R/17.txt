Contemporary art practices are likewise engaged with rendering the nonvisible through inventive techniques and explorations of media. But perhaps the focus for artistic activity in this sphere is less rendering the invisible and more a shift toward non ’optico-centric’ contemporary aesthetics. In David Rokeby’s Dark Matter, first exhibited in 2010, a sonic sculpture permeates a completely darkened space, waiting silently for participants to activate it. [6] Participants must reach out with their hands to shape or sculpt the sound so that it comes into existence through the space. The experience of the work is entirely nonvisual – participants engaged in auditory-kineasthetic-tactile and proprioceptive relations throughout the piece and darkness envelops them.
