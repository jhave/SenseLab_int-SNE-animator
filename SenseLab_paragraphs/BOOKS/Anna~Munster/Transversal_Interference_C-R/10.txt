We see a return to a certain kind of indexicality via a strategy of interference/intervention, here weighing in on the side of the aesthetic, body and process against the digital, numerical order. But, as I will argue throughout this article, interference can no longer be aligned with the aesthetic, and is not easily available as an artistic tactic in the contemporary universe of data-generated technical imaging. And, moreover, the data-generated image is already deeply traversed by nonhuman material patterns of interference.   My third proposition concerns these states of affairs and consequently asserts that interference is already incoporated as a condition of the event of the (scientific) contemporary technical image. In this context, interference provides a diagnostic ordering – an interpretative structuring pattern – responsible for generating a range of contemporary scientific imaging from the very near to the very far; from biological microscopic interaction and development through to astronomical images of plasma nebulae emitted by black holes.
