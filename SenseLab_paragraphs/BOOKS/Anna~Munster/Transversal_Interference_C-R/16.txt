My second proposition asserts that a shift in optics is occurring re-orienting that field toward invisibility as an optical phenomenon in and of itself. [5] For many of us, this seems to suggest a kind of paradox insofar as our optical devices – eyes – deal with the visible spectrum of light behaviour, which in terms of wavelength, sits in the range of about 380 to about 740 nanometers. But there are also ranges of nonvisible (for the human) electromagnetic radiation. We are of course already familiar with optical devices such as night vision glasses that generate visibility for humans under normally nonvisible conditions. We have been experiencing a steady increase in technical applications that render the ‘invisible’ visible. But my proposition here concerns a vector in the opposite direction – the generation of visible invisibilities.
