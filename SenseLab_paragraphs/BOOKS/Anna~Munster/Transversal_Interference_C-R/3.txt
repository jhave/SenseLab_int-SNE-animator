Inserted into The Pencil of Nature (1844) and Sun Pictures in Scotland (1845) – collections of the first commercially published photographic plates – William Henry Fox Talbot placed an inscription, which called for a jump cut in the perception of recorded images: The plates of the present work are impressed by the agency of Light alone, without any aid whatever from the artist's pencil. They are the sun-pictures themselves, and not, as some persons have imagined, engravings in imitation. (Fox Talbot in Gernsheim, 1986: 40)
