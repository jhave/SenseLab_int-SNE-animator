But the emerging optics of invisibility within scientific research into metamaterials also raises another aspect of the composition of imaging. This aspect holds equivocal possibilities for the political and social directions of both art and science and hence impacts upon the ways in which both come to participate in a particular diagram of power. The (meta)materialist effect of cloaking an object in ‘invisibility’ works because the materials are themselves comprised of components that have small inhomogeneities. The differential summed response across these components allows the parameters of the electromagnetic wavelengths hitting the object to be variably manipulated. In general, then, (and I am being quite reductive here for the sake of brevity), metamaterial-cloaking produces interference patterns across the spectrum of electromagnetic waves, resulting in an ‘image’ of invisibility. Furthermore, the actual generation of metamaterials themselves out of components often takes place as a result of processes that deploy interference patterns such as ‘interference lithography’ (Cai and Shalsev, 2009: 42).
