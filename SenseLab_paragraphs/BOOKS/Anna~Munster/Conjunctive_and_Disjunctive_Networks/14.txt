Indeed, these movements and relations of conjoining and disjoining resonate with the sensibility and affectivity discovered and generated by earlier artistic and medial experiments with distributed networked communications. Now, in what is sometimes circumscribed as a “post internet” context (see, for example, Steyerl 2013), it is important to rethink these affective and intense events of memes, media, projects, and collectivities by carefully attending to how networks involve processes and flows of both continuity (conjunction) and cuts (disjunction) rather than the reified image of expansionist connectivity. In order to get at what networked life is like for us as individuated humans, we should proceed from the processual aspects of the experiences of networks, many of which involve technical, nonhuman operations such as recursion, redundancy, and nonlinear dynamics. Yet far from sinking into a sea of complex technical jargon and protocol—although, even so, holding on to some technical precision—I propose that we can approach these operations via the decidedly nontechnical theories of experience found in the late nineteenth/early twentieth century writings of William James.
