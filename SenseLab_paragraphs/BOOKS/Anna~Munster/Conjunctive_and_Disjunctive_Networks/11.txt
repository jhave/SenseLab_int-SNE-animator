And at the very heart and/or edge of all this social imagining, we also find the network as aesthetic in the emergence of the eponymous “New Aesthetic.” Infamously pronounced in the vaguest of terms on the social media and blogging platform, Tumblr, the “New Aesthetic” pointed to the commonplace of networked infrastructure such as satellite imaging and drones as generators of contemporary visual culture, and spoke online from the design(ed) space of blogs and Tumblrs run, mainly, by people working within the creative industries (Bridle 2011a; 2011b). The “New Aesthetic” partakes in the social imagining of life as networked inasmuch as it situates itself as the immediate and immediately responsive interface to the media, technologies, and techniques of informatically connected and generated life.
