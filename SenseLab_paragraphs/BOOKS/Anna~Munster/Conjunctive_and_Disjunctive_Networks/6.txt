This kind of meandering and ambulatory movement of falling and flailing around and across networked sites, conversations, and projects produced an itinerant feel to networked experience. Online experience felt to me like a kind of stumbling upon, falling into, and groping toward. Entry into and knowledge of lists, networks, and environments were both contingent and somewhat secretive—you had to know someone or else discovery was more or less serendipitous. Networked projects and sites were both mysteriously obscure and yet surprisingly open and welcoming. Online engagement was infused with an affective atmosphere that can still be detected when scanning over list archives—a collective sense of exhilaration joined with frustration. Projects emerged out of and attempted to generate a respect for difference in their sensibility, yet equally collapsed easily under the weight of trolling and unrealistic political ideals. Critique and creation co-existed. VNSMatrix, for example, were both infiltrators and critics of spaces they perceived to be already over-determined by sexism, “mainframeism,” and a palpable sense of alignment between the life worlds of geek, hacker masculinity, and computation. List networks on network culture were at once generative and damning of network forces, online governance structures, and emergent corporate forms of computational and technical capitalism. A generation of “net” artists such as Heath Bunting, Olia Lialina, and jodi.org made work online that already engaged with the heterogeneity of networks as simultaneously “open” and proprietorial, available technically to the amateur and hobbyist and imbued with a technical episteme indebted to a cold war legacy.
