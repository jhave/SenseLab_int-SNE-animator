A lived doubling of both engagement and critique, then, colored my entry into online culture and has come to shape my ongoing concern with (an) aesthesia of networks. This is not to make a claim for these earlier online events and engagements as authentic forms of network experience. Instead, I want to suggest that in approaching network experience, networks—as sociotechnical assemblages, as singular and nonlocalised, as standardized communicative protocols operating across open architectures—must also be thought in close proximity to the affectivity of technically inflected experience. The proposition for “an” aesthesia of networks, then, is to think network technicity in relation to the perceptual and affective components of network experience as well.
