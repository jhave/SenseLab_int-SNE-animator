I never made it out of “the Closet” into LambdaMOO proper—the text commands dictating the modes of interaction and navigation with the MOO space remained obscure to me. And so, in tune with this rambling topology of associations, I fell out of this environment into other online projects such as the Australian recode list for new media arts and culture, active for a few years in the late 1990s and moderated by Julianne Pearce, likewise a member of VNSMatrix. There are few traces of the recode list online after it perished at the hands of intense debate and disagreements over funding for new media arts in the Australian context, and the posting styles of net art contributors such as Mez Breeze (Lovink 2002: 204). I later bumped into the fibreculture list after an email correspondence with Mitchell Whitelaw, a theorist, sound designer, and data artist and designer who informed me that to find the list site I needed to search for “fibre” not cyberculture. I settled with the fibreculture network, which morphed into an online open access journal, The Fibreculture Journal (fibreculturejournal.org), still readable and accessible today.
