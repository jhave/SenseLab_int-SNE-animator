An aesthesia of networks—or, more plainly, networking as experience—joins the heterogeneity of humans and nonhumans into arrays that are constantly deforming and reorganizing through dynamic recursions, tending toward both repetition and difference. We find ourselves loosely “concatenated,” to borrow a Jamesian term, with both other humans and with informatic machines, enmeshed in an architecture that is dependent on forces both internal and exterior to specific networks that results in the generation of massively redundant criss-crossing routes and pathways between and across local and global networks as well as as older formations such as the sovereign state or the assembly line (1977: 221). An aesthesia of networks is a proposition for thinking and feeling through networked cultures, art practices, new publics/socialities and emerging formations of networked capitalism that are made possible via the operations of complex relational life today.
