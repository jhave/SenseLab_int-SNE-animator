Why name this aesthetics? When glancing at a few key publications, marketing forms, and information domains, it is very clear that a recurring and formalized model of imaging life as network has taken hold. Throughout the end of the twentieth- and into the first decade of the twenty-first century, the U.S. military has reimagined warfare as “network-centric” (Verton 2003: n. pag.). The Command and Control Research Program of the U.S. Department of Defense published a series of books during this period, culminating in a graphic principle called “power to the edge,” embedding an image of the network as flexible, opening out on to an enemy’s networks, and diffusing control throughout its organizational structure (Alberts and Hayes 2003). In a similar vein, the new image of the contemporary business enterprise is of “agility” (see Hugos 2009). Here the “hierarchy” of the “boss” at the top of the pyramid controlling the flow of information and decision-making is replaced by an image of a network of autonomously functioning units, coordinated by a chief officer. The units are immediately responsive to the interactions that they have with their customers, an emerging market situation, or (shifting) client base. These interactions between company and customers are viewed as “edges”, the concept taken from mathematical graph theory used to describe the links that join the nodes in network analysis. Customers, then, have become “nodes” in the network of the company itself; the company that is able to be agile and flexible in terms of its edges  (here literally the “edge” that both separates and links company from client), will best adapt to the changing directions in which its market or clients are moving. The image of the network that permeates these new business models imagines only soft differences between corporation and client because the client is as much a part of the networked corporation as is its internal organizational structure.
