Many of these earlier experiments with platforms for distributed communications generated a particular kind of aesthesia that is at once nonlocal and intensely embodied. In discussing the experimental network of artists who gathered and performed using the first online real time multimedia collaborative performance software, Keyworx, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Sher Doruff makes a similar observation:
…translocal experience, as an embodied experience, is amplified because your body is … you have the sensation of … how can I say this? The effect of intensities of translocal performance when it’s indeterminate and you’re collectively negotiating and making choices together and you’re playing off those choices as a jazz band would or as a dancers might … the translocal becomes incredibly, intensely physicalised, but your feeling of space is non-locally oriented (Doruff 2012: n. pag.)
What online networking experiments initially made palpable was a kind of stumbling into relation with the differentials of technical speeds, geographical spatial dispersion, and the life rhythms of differing time zones. Things, projects, and online experiences both flowed into one another rapidly and moved on just as quickly, building dense intensities and rapid perishings. In spite of all proclamations about the demise of the internet—whether these have to do with a loss of immediacy or melancholia about the ceding of political ideals to communicational capitalism—the potential to generate novel technosocial and techno-aesthetic events continues for contemporary networked experience.
