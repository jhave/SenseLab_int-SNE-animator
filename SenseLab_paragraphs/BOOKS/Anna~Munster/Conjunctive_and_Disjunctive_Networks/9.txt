All this is quite different from an aesthetics of the network, which, it could be argued, has definitively taken command of culture, politics, and life. Such aesthetics instills a global cultural imaginary of interconnectivity, dominated by a link-node topology, and technically supported by the algorithmic crunching of the innumerably vast hoarding, querying, and patterning of data. Such an aesthetics functions less as a formal mode for analyzing contemporary networked culture and its artifacts, than as a silent operative system that supports and perpetuates information architecture and infrastructure, Western military operations, the reliance on data visualization as unquestioned empirical reality, and the sensibility of sociality as reducible to sets of likes and dislikes. Arjun Appadurai’s concept, developed in the face of a newly minted global sociality of the 1980s and 1990s, puts it well: “the imagination has become an organized field of social practices, a form of work (both in the sense of labor and of culturally organized practice) and a form of negotiation between sites of agency (“individuals”) and globally defined fields of possibility” (1990: 5). That global social imagination has become a “networked” one, seeping through granular and macro dimensions via social practices and military, political, and economic operations and exchange.
