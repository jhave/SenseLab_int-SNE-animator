The majority of public, legal and theoretical discussion concerning the monkey selfies has focussed on questions of copyright in and for the images. Yet PETA has a point. If the images are indeed ‘selfies’, shouldn’t the monkeys own them since they ‘posed for’ and depressed the camera button? Not according to Wikimedia Commons, who, in 2014, claimed that the images necessarily resided in the public domain since an image taken by an animal does not constitute authorship; under the legal frameworks within which copyright is ensconced – authorial rights – animals cannot exercise expressive capacities (Wikipedia, 2016). Slater himself is involved in continuing litigation against Wikimedia on the basis that the images were set up compositionally by him (including, angle, framing and other intentional photographic techniques) and hence copyright resides in him and presumably his artistic personality.
