The most interesting of these challenges lies with both the humanless animal selfie and the possibility that technical apparati might be starting to take their own selfies. Here, we are confronted with a selfie that can no longer be explained by either a politics of self-representation and identity or by questions of mediality even as these are extended out from the photographic to an expanded field of distributed media. Instead, I think we have to return to the question of technics and we have to return technics to the animals; that is, to think technics and animality together in ways that prise the technical apart from the human and anthropological co-genesis that Stiegler, Agamben and, of course, Heidegger lay out for it.
