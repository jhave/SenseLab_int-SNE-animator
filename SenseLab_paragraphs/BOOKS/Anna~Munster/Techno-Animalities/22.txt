Adam Levin, for example, examines Dzhokhar Tsarnev’s (one of the teenage the Boston Bombers) selfie that ended up on the August 2013 cover of Rolling Stone magazine. Here indeed is an example of a prime locus for identity formation of ‘celebrity’ subjectivity. If I had time, I’d probably point to the entanglement of print media with online media platforms at the level of just such nubs of identitarianism, given that these pose vectors of closure on the flux of distributed publishing which ultimately threatens the ongoing survival of such media outlets. Rolling Stone is an interesting case and the media politics are messy – on the one hand, its cover is the epitome of pop culture celebrity representation. On the other hand, Rolling Stone is one of the few spaces in print media that continues to commission long form journalism and the actual piece on Tsranev in the magazine was just such an investigation on the ambiguity of the ‘charming teenager’ who became a terrorist.
