In moves that show both how stretched and flexible copyright law potentially is with respect to the strangeness of contemporary intellectual property, two legal positions on the monkey as self devolved from the legal debate that ensued from the copyright suits. The first upholds that the monkey selfie is ultimately artistically authored by Slater and is therefore his to claim copyright over. The basis for this lies in UK copyright law, which, according to Andres Guadamuz, a legal expert in this field, has shifted in many recent decisions to protect and uphold artistic choice and decision as determinants of authorial rights over the exercise of skilled labour and time in the execution of contested artefacts (2016). In court decisions that have mainly revolved around questions of computational generation of intellectual property and authorship, Article 6 of the UK’s Copyright Term Directive (93/98/EEC) defines ‘original’ as a work that is the “author’s own intellectual creation reflecting his [sic] personality” (Guadamuz, 2016). According to Guadamuz, Slater, protected as a UK author can claim copyright of the monkey selfies because the photographs reflect his human personality and his creative decisions.
