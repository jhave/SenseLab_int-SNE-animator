In 2011, David Slater, a wildlife photographer, set up a camera in the midst of a group of crested Macaque monkeys in a jungle in Sulawesi, Indonesia. Unhappy with the results he had been getting as he shot groups of Macaques in situ, he set up his camera on a tripod and left the monkeys to their ‘own’ devices. He supposed that the monkeys had seen themselves reflected in the lens of his camera and that this had disturbed them. Perhaps if he removed himself from the assemblage, he ruminated, left them alone with the camera body to ‘play’, they might enjoy exploring the apparatus and coincidentally take some pictures of the relaxed sort of shots he was seeking: monkey-at-play-(with-the-aid-of-technology) in-the-wild.(ref to Slater website)
