I will return to these relations that produce a certain subjectivation and to questions of what kind of photographic practice a selfie might be considered to be a little later. Suffice to say, that if the selfie is about a self that is performative and a self performed through others’ medial registrations of that performance, then the monkey selfie image is already suggestive of an exploded subjectivity. Even if the monkeys do not metacommunicatively perform their selves via these images (and we have not yet investigated whether they do or not, or indeed what they are doing with and to the image and camera), on the side of socially medial humans, we are doing just this for them. The virality of the monkey selfie, and a range of other ‘selfies’ that emerge at the edge of the subjectivation ‘humanness’, suggest that ‘self’ has become loose enough in networked socialities to reverberate, if not enfold more-than-human dimensions. This first oscillation of monkey-human-monkey operates in relation to processes of subjectivation, suggesting operations of neoliberal sociotechnical machines of capture, in for example the entanglement of creativity and entreneurship playing out through shifting frameworks for evaluating copyright. But lines of flight or escape from such sociotechnical machines also open out in the reach toward more-than-human agentialism.
