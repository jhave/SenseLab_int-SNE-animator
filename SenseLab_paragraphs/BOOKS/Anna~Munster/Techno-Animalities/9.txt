Or could we say, instead, that what the monkey selfie in fact exposes is the extent to which we humans participate in something monkey through selfies? The monkey selfie is interesting for two reasons, then. First, because it sits at the fringe of what we still attempt to preserve as human – intentional aesthetic and technical production, and which is still (although barely) protected by legal frameworks such as copyright. By reclaiming the monkey selfie as a human copyrighted image, we would also need to disclaim it, ultimately, as a selfie, for it must originate instead in the intentions and personality of Slater as a wildlife photographer. But then we must discredit its expressiveness, which is all animal and which touches us affectively in the refrain of the smile or in the hapticality of a monkey arm outstretched; that is, through the contingencies of monkeys at play in a ‘distant’ Sulawesi jungle. The selfie is metacommuicative not simply at the level of the subject of the image but also within a more general context of metacommunicative networking – others in social media contexts acknowledging the image as a registration of the act of taking an image of the self. As a range of recent media and photographic analysis of image within the visual and social cultures and platforms of networked media has argued, selfies cannot simply be understood at the level of ‘self-representation’ but must be understood through cultures of distributed networked media.
