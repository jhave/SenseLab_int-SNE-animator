However, in the immediate context of discussing the selfie, what is important about Adam Levin’s analysis of Tsarnev’s selfie is that he looks at the many posts and repostings of that same selfie, which were in circulation on Facebook and other sites prior to the Rolling Stone cover publication. It was only its publication in the context of the representation of celebrity – and which Facebook users roundly condemned on the RS Facebook site – that Tsarnev’s selfie became a fixed representation of ‘the self’. Levin suggests that the Tsarnev selfie’s prior circulation across a myriad of online contexts points to a ‘self’ in flux appearing and and re-appearing in all kinds of situations. Importantly for Levin and others such as Paul Frosh (2015), and Edgar Gómez Cru z and Helen Thornham (2015), the selfie is less tethered to questions of self-representation and needs to be situated more within the metacommunicative, enactive and plastic flows of networked data cultures: …the ambiguity evinced by the selfie, in which it serves less as a self-portrait, and more as a portrait of the self in the act of self portrayal, with the emphasis shifting from the representation of physiognomy to that of the kind of technological immersion implied by selfie production and distribution (Levin, 2014).
