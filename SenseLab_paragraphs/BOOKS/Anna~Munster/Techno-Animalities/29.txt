The jungle database is, instead, a rhythm machine. The depression of the camera button is percussive, following a technicity that Andre Leroi-Gourhan saw in animals, who recurrently grasp and scrape with sticks, stones and so forth: Everything required to constitute human technicity is already there, and it all comes together the moment tools enter the scene. (Leroi-Gouhran, 1993: 244)
