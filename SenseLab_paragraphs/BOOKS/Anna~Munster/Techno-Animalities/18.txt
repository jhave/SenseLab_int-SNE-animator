Here is where Agamben’s anthropological machine never ceases in its perpetuation of the anthropos as its prime subjectivation. In posing ‘historicity’ as a definitive mode of being ‘in’ time, other ‘animal’ temporalities necessarily fall away as ‘outside’ of time. The tick – with its infamous three intensities of smell, temperature and hapticality comprising its affective relationality according to Jacob von Uexkall – is a problem for Agamben because it potentially lies outside of ‘history’. The capacity of the tick to lie in wait for up to 18 years to become affective and to be, for von Uexkall, neither living nor dead but suspended is, for Agamben, only an iteration of the anthropological machine, robbing the tick of a world in which time plays out through life history across 18 years.  If the tick is without a world and outside of time it cannot be said to have life for Agamben, or at least such life is only bare life, if that.
