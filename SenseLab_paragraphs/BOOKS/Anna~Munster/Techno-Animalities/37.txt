What else would a drone do in times of peace if not to become expressive through ludic gestures manifesting via a style of drone-camera-play? A gesture that, as we have seen, is explored not only or even primarily by humans but can be found in the rhythmic refraining of animals in a jungle as much as a drone in front of a mirror. Such techno-animal rhythms and styles suggest an aesthesia of the more-than-human from which we might reconsider subjectivation as processes of collectivation, conditioning, if also captured by, the all too human selfie.
