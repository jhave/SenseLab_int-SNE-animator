Collectivation, then, stresses a dimension to these processes that arranges or energises components of subjectivation impersonally, and through semioses that oscillate across both asignifying and signifying processes. This dimension is no doubt old or at least has always been at work, yet discovers a vitality and urgency under contemporary conditions. Such collective processes cut across and conjoin elements of the more-than-human and asemiotic; elements that are animal and/or technical conjoin with signs and subjectivations. We are operating with refrains, sign-particles, metastabilities, potentialities. Monkey-camera-play.
