Most of the images taken during the monkey-play session Slater staged were out of focus. But 300 odd images later, he nonetheless got his money shots. He selected three medium close-ups of a couple of the Macaques, who appeared to be smiling straight into the camera’s lens as they had simultaneously depressed the camera’s shoot button. In one of the images, the monkey’s extended arm is also in frame, a gesture, instantly recognisable in the online world of image exchange, marking a photograph as a ‘selfie’. Slater licensed these three images to the news agency Caters, which published them in various online global media outlets as just that: ‘monkey selfies’.  The images went viral and their republication by the platforms Techdirt and Wikimedia triggered a suite of copyright, anti-copyright and legal rulings concerning creativity, personhood/authorship and technicity (refs). Both their republication and the subsequent judicial proceedings struggled with issues of how image and authorial position(s) could be assigned or understood in networked and nonhuman contexts.
