The rhythmic jungle database of the Macaque monkeys is less instrumentalised than a toolbox. The images that, for the monkeys, accidentally record their rhythmicity, also signal something less instrumental â€“more an excess generated beyond survivalism. Something snapped in the range of gestures and expressions running from their hands through to and across their faces. What is playing out with the Macaques and perhaps any animal selfie or photobombing event is the extent to which the animal cannot be reduced to mere function or instrumentality. Animals also enact, perform and participate expressively and through play with technics.
