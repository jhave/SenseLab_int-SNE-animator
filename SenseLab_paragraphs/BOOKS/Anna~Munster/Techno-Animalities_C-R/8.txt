Yet what the case of the monkey selfies foregrounds is the complexity of relations that constitute the production of self and image; human and animal; play and intent; media and milieu, in contemporary technical assemblages. As both photographs and material agents in circuits of networking, these selfies trace and lay down pathways that generate a topology of the participatory and nonparticipatory in processes of (continual) deformation. On the one hand, the monkey is deemed nonhuman and incapable of being an ‘expressive author’. On the other hand, the image is a selfie, and goes viral precisely because the monkey is imaged in the act of registering that it is taking its own picture. The monkey selfie straddles a relationality that no longer holds together through a logic of exclusion – human/nonhuman – upon which copyright is based. Indeed, the selfie’s entire raison d’etre is to function metacommunicatively:  ‘here I am, taking a picture of myself’. If the monkey images are then selfies – and why else would they have attracted the global attention that they did – then the monkeys taking them are participating in a mode of reflexive personhood, at least as far as certain production of personhood is performed via the selfie image in and via a digital, networked milieu. But it is also the case that such a distributed mode of being a person moves us across a surface in which ‘the subject’ of the photograph, indeed subjectivity, is becoming less and less human, and more more-than-the human.
