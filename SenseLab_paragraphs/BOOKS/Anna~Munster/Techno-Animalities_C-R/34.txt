Some of that same amorphous yet immediately felt affect is at work in online visual cultures that contribute to and generate techno-animal collectivations. The animal selfie, then, can be thought of as a participant in such affective flows at the same time that it can be analysed in terms of a machine of facialisation, which, embedded in techniques such as pattern matching, suggests subjectivations that comprise a diagram of predictive power. But the inflection points of such a diagram might just be animal and other kinds of nonhuman gestures, which also register through practices such as selfies. Such gestures already metacommunicatively perform a logic of mutual inclusion – look, they say, here is a gesture of camera-play, of animal-technics – where the image should only register an animal acting animal-like, that is, nonhuman, in its natural habitat.
