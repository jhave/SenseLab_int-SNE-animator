Yet in applying the very same vectors at work in copyright – ones that clearly signal how ‘self’ and ‘personality’ are completely enmeshed with a political economy of neoliberal entrepreneurship – a second position on the claim to authorship emerges. Chris Springman, an NYU law professor, argues that the monkey selfies do not originate with Slater’s novel photographic manoeuvres since these were purely accidental. In Springman’s view, then the images were uncopyrightable since they originate via pure accident: copyright’s not there to reward people for their labor – it’s to incentivize people to create new books or poems…[d]id this guy need an incentive to produce monkey selfies? No. He needed an incentive to go to Indonesia to take photographs. And by accident, he ended up with monkey selfies. (Springman in O’Conner, 2015)
