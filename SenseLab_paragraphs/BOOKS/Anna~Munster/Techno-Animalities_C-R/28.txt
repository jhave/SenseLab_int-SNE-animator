Indeed, they may well be animal business more generally. Isn’t the entire field of cat, animal internet visual culture, just that – animals at play with and in relation to an apparatus?. If for Vilem Flusser, the camera is less visual and more programmatic, then it is the animal that discovers, for the human, something in excess of that programmaticity by percussively pressing its button with little interest in its image-making capacities. This excess gathers itself in the selfie, since the animal selfie shares something with the human selfie that we can discover prior to the production of the image as visual field. Or, as it turns out, the human selfie shares something with the animality of play, in which the selfie affectively propels us to participate. That there are 300+ images taken by the Macaques is a clue; that the images themselves exhibit traces of play is also important. We start to get a sense of a jungle database emerging along very different lines than those into which human selfies are ordinarily deposited: vast image databases housed on the servers of networked corporations that also serve as training sets for those corporations’ R&D programs of pattern matching and machine learning.
