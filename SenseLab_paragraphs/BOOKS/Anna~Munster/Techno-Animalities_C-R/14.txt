This, it should be emphasized is always collective – transversally so. That is, its collectivity is constituted by all those forces and processes that cut across individual subjects and their expressions, statements, significations both on the side of the social and molar consistencies and at the level of the molecular; that is, the intensive, affective and pre-linguistic/verbal: …the term "collective" should be understood here in the sense of a multiplicity that develops beyond the individual, on the side of the socius, as well as on this side (so to speak) of the person, that is, on the side of pre-verbal intensities that arise more from a logic of the affects than from a well-circumscribed, comprehensive logic. (Guattari, 196 in The Guattari Reader)
