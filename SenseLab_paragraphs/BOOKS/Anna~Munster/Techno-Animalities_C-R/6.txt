Neither of these positions  throws up new problems for copyright or creativity both of which have been in torsion for two decades or more under the conditions of online and distributed modes of dissemination of commodities, services and labor, as well as the shifting sands of neoliberal networked corporatism as the latter negotiates and complicates diffuse forms of nation state and their juridical reach. But a third, perhaps more interesting, position was presented by PETA, the animal rights group, who brought a suit in a Californian court on behalf of one of the monkeys, ‘Naruto’, claiming that he owned the copyright since, indeed, the image was a selfie – an animal enacting the performance of its own image. Unsurprisingly, PETA lost its case. But then, perhaps the point is – made by many in the animal studies debate not least of all by Carey Wolfe (ref) – that by pinning one’s ontology to a framework of (human) rights, the animal can often come off poorly.
