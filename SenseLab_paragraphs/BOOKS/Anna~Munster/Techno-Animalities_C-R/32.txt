Such ludic gestures signal the minimal difference between play and fight – bringing these together and holding them apart. According to Bateson, play is performative, says Massumi, but also carries the metacommunication, “ ‘this is not a bite’ or these actions do not denote what they would denote” (Massumi, 2014:7). For Bateson, the play-fight is paradoxical and can only be resolved by understanding that a metacommunicative register operates different from the communicative one. But for Massumi, it isn’t so simple as differentiating out the two registers, since enacted play-fights between animals both hold apart and collapse the two registers continuously. Trying to rescue logic isn’t so simple either: the ludic gesture says what it denies and denies what it says – or denies what it enacts and enacts what it denies (Massumi, 2014:7). Massumi surmises: the animal play gesture enacts an altogether different logic of mutual inclusion, which has an efficacy – it creates play. Play is performed as a ‘more-than’, signalled through a singular style – the style of the nip that is minimally different from the combative bite.
