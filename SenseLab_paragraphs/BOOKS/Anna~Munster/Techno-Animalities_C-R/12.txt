As the monkey image becomes a selfie, as we distribute and post the image across networked contexts, something is also happening to us. We become monkey, catching a certain monkey style that infuses the image through the Macaques’ camera play. Our viral networking of this image occurs because we catch the monkey’s style participating – without putting our hands up for it but rather outstretching them – in monkey technicity. We extend and disseminate monkeyness when we designate these images selfies. This second arrangement is less vector than an ecology of monkey|human|technics in which, I want to suggest, processes of collectivation are most active.
