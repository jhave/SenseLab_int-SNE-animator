I use collectivation here rather than collectivization, the latter suggesting more a deliberate human politics of coming together in relation to a distinct tradition of political formation. Collectivation, instead, can be thought more in tandem with the concept ‘subjectivation’. This is French for subjectification – the production of a form or mode of subjectivity – and is sometimes directly translated as such in English by people such as Maurizio Lazzarato when thinking about Deleuze and Guattari on subjectivity. Here, subjectivation refers to the processes of production of subjectivity – a sociotechnical and political assemblage ˆ­ –  ‘…resulting in the determination of relative subjectification proceedings, or assignations of individuality and their shifting distributions within discourse.” (Deleuze and Guattari, ATP, 80).
