What I like about this work is the way in which it enfolds the metacommunicative register into the milieu of online everydayness, recognisable as the backdrop to networked visual culture. An aesthetic self-referentiality – look this is an image within an image – is achieved via the mirror frames, that at the same time become the only means that a post-war drone could take a relaxed selfie. Picture frames and mirrors have a long visual genealogy of metacommunicative entanglements and explosions of subjectivity in Western art from at least Velasquez’ 1656 Las Meninas on…and here we have a series of drones nonsensuously prehending occasions of their own self-imaging. But their milieu is not so much the gallery hang, in spite of some of the suggestiveness of these frames. Instead it’s the banal interiority of domestic space that features in so many selfmade Youtube videos and online profile images. This makes the drone selfies immediately part of a series that speaks to networking as milieu for more-than-human collectivation.
