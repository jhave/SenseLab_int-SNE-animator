Let’s return to the monkeys and their 300 hundred-odd photos in the Sulewesi jungle. On Slater’s own website, we hear a story about an intrepid photographer who treks through thick jungle in pursuit of the wild macaques (Slater, 2000-2015). It’s interesting to note that Slater initially believes the macaques to be threatened and reads them as functioning in a semi-aggressive survival mode. Yet give them a camera, tripod and wide-angled lens in which they are able to see their own faces reflected; hey presto, they laugh and begin to act like humans, playing, jawing and clucking straight into the lens only to snap a selfie or 3. But what seems more plausible a scenario here is that the opticocentric aspects of the camera apparatus feature much less for the monkeys than for the human photographer. What is more likely is that the monkeys, initially poised aggressively toward an intruder, then switch styles to play. The smiles and gestures solicited by the camera occur because it is a responsive apparatus – it makes a sound and can be depressed. And yes, the lens may well be an additional feature. But by the extraordinary amount of both professional and amateur shots available online that indicate monkey-camera play abounds, it’s clear that camera shutters are monkey business.
