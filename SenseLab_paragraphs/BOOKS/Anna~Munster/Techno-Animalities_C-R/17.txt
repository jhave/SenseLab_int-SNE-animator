Moreover, I think by understanding the ‘assemblage’ as collectivating process{es); by reckoning subjectivation as more-than-human; and, most importantly, by keeping in play a relational ontogenesis that is conditioning, nonlinear and infolding, we might come at a sense of what we can call ‘modes of affective participation in and for techno-animalities’. These modes place us on the side of animality and technicity but outside, or at least not necessarily subsumed by, forms with which we might more easily associate: the subject, historicity regulated by chronos, signification. I don't want to suggest we occupy a territory prior to these or that techno-animalities are beyond human form(s) as some state that we wish to arrive at or with which we might converge. What I do want to suggest is that unless we take such more-than-human, often impersonal and affective collectivations seriously, we end up always returning to the centrifuge of a particular individuation of the human: the human as measure of a ‘prior’ or a ‘beyond’.
