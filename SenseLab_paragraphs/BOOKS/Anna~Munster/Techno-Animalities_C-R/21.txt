What I want to suggest, then, returning to the ‘monkey selfie’, are the ways in which monkey+selfie might help to activate a ‘both and’ logic, drawing together components of the animal, technical and more-than-human into novel collectivations. This is a logic that displaces the before or after since it removes the human-nonhuman logic. There are no guarantees here, of course, since the ‘selfie’ also pulls us into subjectivations that end up on the side of the already formed. Current photographic theory struggles to articulate the complex questions of subjectivity thrown up by the selfie, often falling into a ‘condemnation of the narcissistic tendencies of neoliberal social mediation’ position, or into a celebration of the ways in which a sharing of the self via online distribution platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook and so forth, enable the production of a ‘community’ (Tifentale, 2014). More recently some interesting visual analysis of the selfie has begun to emerge that situates the technicity of the selfie in a complexity that reaches toward other kinds of subjectivation although is still fraught with representational politics. The most interesting of these analyses point to the extent to which the locus of the ‘self’ in distributed media is a lagoon of shifting sands, hence as ‘self-portrait’ the selfie is a brief instant of capture rather than the locus of forms of identity.
