The second and more profound reason that the monkey selfie poses something for us about a different ontogenesis for animal-technical human assemblages and modes of participation happens before both the subjectivation ‘self’ and the selfie’s part in this. Metacommunicative dimensions of the monkey selfie are already at work as the monkeys’ play with the camera in Sulawesi before the image becomes a ‘selfie’ but while the image is being taken. What I want to suggest is that the making of these images by the monkeys already harbours conditions for a certain assemblage that is both technical and expressive. The resultant image – a collectivation of monkey-technical aesthesia sweeping the human photographer up in to this and bringing us along for the ride– is a kind of diagramming of a techno-animality that signals different techno-animal becomings.
