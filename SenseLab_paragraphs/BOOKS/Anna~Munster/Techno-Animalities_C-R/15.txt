Guattari draws on Simondon’s understanding of individuation as processually multiplicitous. In particular, Simondon criticized sociologism for taking groups as a given (Simondon in Combes, 2011: 43). Instead any group, any collectivity must individuate both on the side of the socius or the formed as continuously in-formation even at long or slow timescales and preindividually. Socius and preindividual are differently and differentially individuating. A collectivity is both individuating and a grouping of individuations, depending on the dimension examined or its phase in a relationality, process and according to which of the various formations are approached. Guattari eventually settled for the term ‘collective assemblages of ennunciation’ moving on from his earlier ideas of subject-groups and subjugated groups, developed via institutional and during therapeutically pragmatic critiques of psychoanalysis and psychiatry. Such collective assemblages are, ‘arrangements of subjectivization’ and, for him, these do not necessarily correlate to already circumscribed groups.  Hence it is not the group itself or the ‘socius’ that steers the course of generating collectivities. Instead, such assemblages cut across both individuals in the group and the subjectivity of the group itself, including, ‘ways of seeing the world, emotional systems, conceptual machines, memory devices, economic, social components, elements of all kinds.’ (Guattari, 2009:181). Nonetheless these would not exclude processes in which both individuals and groups actually engage and indeed ethico-aesthetically set in motion. We could perhaps say that Guattari doesn’t so much discard ‘the group’ but rather recharges its transversal potentialites by displacing these to impersonal, metastable and chaosmotic registers.
