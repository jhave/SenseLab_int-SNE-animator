Soft imaging the brain
In the Gary Small study used by Carr, evidence of the internet’s ability to ‘rewire’ the plastic and malleable circuitry of the brain is furnished, as we compare the before and after snapshots of a plastic brain that has surfed the internet for a period of time. Initially, the brain of the ‘naïve’ user is relatively unwired for hypermedia engagement. Fast forward 5 hours per day x 5 days of web surfing and this naïve brain’s ‘wiring’ lights up differently – incontrovertible evidence that neuro-anatomical change has taken place due to networked media engagement! In a voice poised between wonder and terror at the incredible swiftness of such ‘reprogramming on the fly’, Carr remarks, ‘The human brain is almost infinitely malleable’ (2010b). Yet as with all before and after shots, change itself can only be inferred. What is captured in these before and after juxtapositions of snapshots selected from an fMRI sequence, then, is the fact that change has happened, indexed to the implication that what we are seemingly looking at in these images is that change rendered in neuro-anatomical structure.
