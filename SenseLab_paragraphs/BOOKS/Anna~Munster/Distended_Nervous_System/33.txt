4. Google neural network researchers claim to have taught a complexly layered and iterative neural networks to generate representational images from visual noise. Further, these researchers also suggests that in having located the possibility of image generation (that is, visual pattern that results in representation of recognisable physical phenomena), might reveal insight into how human neural processes lead to creativity. See, Alexander Mordvintsev, et. al., ‘Inceptionism’ 2015. The approach taken by Facebook, on the other hand, is toward the iterative production of increasingly ‘naturalistic’ images from ‘noise’ created by pitting neural networks against each other. Hence the name Generative Adversarial Networks.
