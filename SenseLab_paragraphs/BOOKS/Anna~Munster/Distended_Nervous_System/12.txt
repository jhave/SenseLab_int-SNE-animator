The materiality of fMRIs must here be taken into account; in particular, we should note that an fMRI (as is the case for Magnetic Resonance Imaging generally) is not an optically generated image. In order to become an image as such, its non-optically generated data must be transposed into an image space. Like MRIs, fMRIs measure the combination of magnetic signals emitted from hydrogen nuclei in water from the area of the body being imaged. Magnetic field gradients are captured in the scanning process, and their frequencies and rate of change are related to the position where the signal is picked up by the scanner. The magnetic signals captured – in fMRIs these are emitted over time as the cerebral blood flow changes in response to metabolic stimulation – are composed of a series of sine waves, with individual frequencies and amplitudes. These frequencies and amplitudes are computed using a process called the Fourier transform, which converts signal from the time domain into the frequency domain. The frequencies are then separated out and their amplitudes are plotted as an image. A number of manipulations in the Fourier transform space that allow for smoothing of the final image data, elimination of noise via, for example, high pass filters and so forth, take place before the ‘image’ of an fMRI is generated. What is scanned and what is done computationally to the signal captured are fundamentally non-optical and the image/s that eventuate map the rate of change as a function of time. What we are looking at in this form of neuro-imaging is first and foremost a temporally imputed image scape.
