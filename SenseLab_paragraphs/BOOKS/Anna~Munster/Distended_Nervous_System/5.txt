The reterritorialising vectors of networked corporatism, its platforms, research and mediality present us with a distended rather than extended nervous system that McLuhan had suggested we were reaching toward during the 1960s. (2003: 4, 68) ‘Neuro’ everything in and of contemporary media bloats our brains and bodies. Yet McLuhan was more prescient than he is often credited with having been, having foreseen the commercial grab at our nerves: 
Once we have surrendered our senses and nervous systems to the private manipulation of those who would try to benefit from taking a lease on our eyes and ears and nerves, we don't really have any rights left. Leasing our eyes and ears and nerves to commercial interests is like handing over the common speech to a private corporation, or like giving the earth's atmosphere to a company as a monopoly. (2003: 99) 
But the conception of media as prostheses or extensions of our perception and sensorimotor systems does not immediately get at the sense in which the networked turns toward and against the neuro swell encephalitically from a space simultaneously constituted by and deemed already anterior to both perception and motoricity. Distensions of the nerves suggest instead something pushing outwards that is already immanent to that system – this indeed is where networked media hope to have inserted themselves.  Yet rather than examine how this intercalary event of media might have come to have occurred, critics of networked media have likewise turned to the neuro for evidence of the perils of contemporary computational life. Whether the turn is towards or away from networked media, computation, or associated areas of research and development such as machine learning, the neural has steadily gained status as the anterior ground of a now epigenetic mediality.
