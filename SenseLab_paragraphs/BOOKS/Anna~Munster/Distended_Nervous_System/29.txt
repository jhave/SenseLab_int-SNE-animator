But the fMRI corralled into ‘demonstrating’ structural change – as with Nicholas Carr’s deployment of Small’s studies of structural change in web surfers’ brains – loses its virtualities. It loses the potential to express the brain changing again in response to….well, less exposure to the web, exposure to noise in the street, exposure to anything whatsoever! Losing a relation to its virtualities means it also loses its relations to the material processes that neuroscience now ascribes to brains: plasticity and dynamism. In No Lie MRI’s techniques and modus operandi for the fMRI, the indeterminacy of a dynamic, distributed brain-mind is sacrificed neural processes are fixed and as they feed into a neuro-perceptual politics similar to that of networked media corporations such as Google. Here the fluidity of the spectrum comprising attentional capacities is whittled down into bounded territories, captured as linear and one-directional flows such as anticipation-intention and prediction-consumption. What both No Lie MRI and Google seek, is to insert themselves at a molecular level in the temporal intervals between what is felt at a lived relational level and what we know or how we will then act, harnessing attention to prediction so that we inhabit an environment where ‘they’ feel what we are going to do before we feel or know it. An insertion into the middle of something happening – the readiness potential of the now – in order to fold in and effectively close out openness to an indeterminate futurity.
