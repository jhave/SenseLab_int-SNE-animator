Soft nerves, hard data
Both the uses of fMRIs as evidence of media changing brain structure and as imaging of the interiority of subjectivity in process raise a number of political and conceptual issues about the status and deployment of the neurological as material artifact, which I will return to later.  But for the moment I want to draw attention to how the diffuse mobilisation of techniques such as fMRI, signals an increasing turn toward the neural as a means of thinking, acting in, negotiating and shaping the contours of contemporary media and culture. Thought, focus, attention – especially of the so-called ‘iGeneration’ of 18-24 year-olds – and the synapses themselves have increasingly been characterised as deteriorating, in a state of crisis or under attack, targeted by economies, techniques and cultures of fragmenting and accelerating media.  Computational culture's revving up/dumbing down tendencies effect a significant shift, according to Carr, away from depth and substance toward the flatlands of surface insignificance, 'the shallows':
…our online habits continue to reverberate in the workings of our brain cells even when we’re not at a computer. We’re exercising the neural circuits devoted to skimming and multitasking while ignoring those used for reading and thinking deeply (Carr, 2010b)
For those at the alarmist end of the turn to the neurological in media analysis, the software and hardware of media technologies are literally turning our 'wetware' to mush and bloating rather than extending our central nervous system.
 
The most strident of these claims – particularly by Carr, Greenfield, and earlier Wolf as to the actual 're-wiring' of the brain's structure by exposure to the computer screen and internet – also signals a turn away from contemporary media technologies and culture. Both Stiegler and Hayles' arguments are more nuanced. Nonetheless they conjoin with Carr and Greenfield inasmuch as the vector they follow deploys neuroscience evidentially yet simultaneously deploys nebulous 'entities' such as 'the mind', 'attention' 'generations' 'youth' and 'the internet'. But it is precisely the unproblematic unity and homogeneity of such entities that is questioned by a number of contemporary neuroscientists: Vilanyur Ramachandran’s behavioural neurology or Steven Rose’s neurobiology, for example.6 It is important, then, to pay attention to the variety of neuroscience being evoked in nonscientific turns to the neurological against networked media.
