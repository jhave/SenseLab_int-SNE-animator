This ‘turn’ toward neuroscience has struck those in the humanities of a certain generation – and with a vested interest in ‘literature’ and scholarship – the hardest. Although not quite in the same vein, Katherine Hayles has likewise fretted about the potential loss of deep thought and reading (2007). And along somewhat different lines, Bernard Stiegler sees a new formation of biopower – psychopower – emerging, whose pharmacological and neural marketing technics work at the level of the neuronal capture of an entire younger generation’s attentional capacities (2010; 2008). This is a rather amorphous crowd admittedly, yet this increasing shift toward neuroscience to bolster evidence for the decline in literary and cognitive standards have registered across contemporary media analysis.  Geert Lovink has located ‘a neurological turn in internet criticism’, and points out that such a turn has been taking place in a German-speaking context (2010). The neurological turn, he argues, is evidence of an obsession with mind and consciousness generally by media outlets, especially evidenced by the quantity of reportage about neuroscience and neuroimaging, which ranges from locating the brain’s ‘centre’ for happiness using fMRIs to the role of mirror neurons in all and any examples of human cognition.
