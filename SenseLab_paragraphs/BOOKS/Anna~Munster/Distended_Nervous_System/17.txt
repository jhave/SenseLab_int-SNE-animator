From one angle it appears that deployment of machine learning techniques across, especially online industries, signals that biological neurality may have fled the scene of such models. Yet Google’s search aspirations rest precisely upon a reterritorialisation of mind/intelligence in which a raft of machine learning techniques from data mining through to dataset training reclaim the noncognitive dimensions of brain and thought for the technics of artificial neural networks. The neural has definitively re-entered the fray when aspects of machine learning come to be applied, as they are with Google’s Prediction API, to anticipating or pre-empting the domain of pre-cognitive thought-action relationships such as ‘the serendipitous’ or ‘anticipation/prediction’. I want to suggest, then, that networked media really are re-turning to the neural in their exploration of techniques for machine learning. What they hope to territorialise via creating an AI that can, for example, ‘read’ large datasets, is a kind of intelligence that exists interstitially in te nebulous spaces before conscious (human) thought clearly emerges.
