From neuro-turns to neuropolitics.
This is where the neurological turns in and against networked media biurficate. How and where neurological architectures and processes are situated and deployed – ‘in the brain’ or relationally and transversally across brains and media ­– differ in the critiques by Carr et. al, on the one hand, and the r&d direction of networked corporations’ neuro-perceptual territorialisations, on the other. Both the neurological turn against networked media and the neuro-perceptual turn toward prediction use neuroscience and artefacts such as fMRIs and yet they remain worlds apart. The critique of networked media based upon a conception of damage done to thought, attention and youth by Carr and Greenfield radically misconstrues and misconceives the neuropolitics of contemporary networked media. Lovink asks where, in all this, is the economic and political analysis of Google and other networked coporations, and of the colonization of content, real time and labour (2010)?
