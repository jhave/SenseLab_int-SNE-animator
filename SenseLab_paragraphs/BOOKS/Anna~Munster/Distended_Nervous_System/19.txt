What crucially differentiates this neural vector from the one that concerns Carr, Greenfield and others, is that here we are dealing with dispersed, pervasive and entangled interconnectivities. The relative unity of phenomena such as deep ‘thought’, focused ‘attention’, mind and brain as structure, ‘the young brain’, the old brain, the younger generation, the older generation (and so on) posited by the ‘anti-networkers’ such as Carr et. al., give way to vectors and relationalities populating networked media such as artificial neurons, data-neural architectures, pattern and, increasingly, prediction that precedes reflective or intentional thought. While we stumble around as clueless co-habitants of radically distributed, embedded, networked ecologies, Nicholas Carr is mainly worried about what is going on inside his head.
