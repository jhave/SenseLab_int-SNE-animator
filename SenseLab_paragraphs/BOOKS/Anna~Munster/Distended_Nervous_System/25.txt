But what does an fMRI actually visualise? Nothing quite so simple or complex as wiring and firing or intentionality. To begin with, and as I mentioned earlier, an fMRI is not specifically an optically constituted image. Like MRIs, fMRIs measure a combination of signals from all over the object (the part of the body). What is being scanned and what is done to the signal captured computationally is in quite a fundamental way non-imagistic and closer, if anything, to a computational processing of audio signal. And when dealing with the actual transduction of this data into image, we need to additionally to think through what it means to image a process of cerebral change. The areas of ‘colour’ we often see in magnetic resonance imaging are converted from grayscale in the first transduced images (that is, after the Fourier transform space has been transformed into image data), and these map a ‘capture’ of hemodynamic response. We see the surplus of oxyhemoglobin (oxygenated blood) remaining in the veins, measured as a ratio of the increase to – in the case of fMRIs of the brain – decrease of cerebral blood flows. Active neurons require both glucose and oxygen in order to fire and an fMRI traces the movement of blood transporting glucose and oxygen through the vascular system necessary for firing. But as is usual in the area of neurological imaging, what is being imaged is up for question. Are we seeing the trace of the activity of neurons themselves, for example, or are we seeing the trace of activity caused by neurotransmitters, which likewise require cerebral blood flow? An fMRI cannot distinguish these substantially – it is a mapping of oxygenated blood flow; that is, of processes. Furthermore, although the spatial resolution of the fMRI is remarkable, its temporal resolution is relatively poor with an estimated 4–5 second period needed for image capture during which changes in blood flow may have occurred at least twice over.
