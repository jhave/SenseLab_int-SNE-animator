In the process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead and William James – returning now to a world that has effectively black-boxed most of its processes – all experience is already throbbing with feeling: ‘The experience starts as that smelly feeling, and is developed by mentality into the feeling of that smell’ (Whitehead, 1933: 246). A ‘smelly feeling’ is neither possessed by us nor directly attributable to some odorous object. It is, instead, a smell’s diffusion and tonalities, its timbre; pungency still shaded by all its redolent relations to old smells lingering, new smells pressing for air.
