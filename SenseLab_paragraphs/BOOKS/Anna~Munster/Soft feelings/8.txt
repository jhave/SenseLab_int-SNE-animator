All feelings begin ‘smelly’ – begin already in process. Perhaps none more so than ‘soft’ feelings, since data, quite literally, processes incessantly. But the smell and tonality of soft feelings run the risk of being boxed away and re-packaged as ‘the feeling of’….Flume, instead, enables something beautifully ‘elsewhere’ to emerge: a ‘feeling of’ processing in process, shaded still by moods, flushes, and potentials.
