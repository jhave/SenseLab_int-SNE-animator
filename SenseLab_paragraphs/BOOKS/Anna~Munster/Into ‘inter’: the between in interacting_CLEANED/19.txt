The project wants to find modes of becoming collective through the cultivation of techniques for collaborative thinking-making-feeling. One of the strangest techniques we have cultivated, out of necessity, is Skype reading groups. Setting a difficult and often complex philosophical or scientific text ahead of time, we meet every couple of weeks in online audio mode only using the Skype platform in order to preserve bandwidth but allow for as many people as possible to contribute. The sessions are full of technical ‘failures’: breakdowns in transmission, signal feedback, network glitches not to mention the ambient noise of people forgetting to mute their microphones when their dog rabidly barks in the background. And yet we have persevered because all this signaletic matter that takes place through the Skype platform together with all the stumbling and interruptions that have occurred when a group of people talks without any visual cues, has facilitated a different capacity across the group(s) to enact in the immediacy of everyday life. We noticed that after about six months of meeting this way, our collective discussions slowed – we said less and listened more; we waited and thought while online; we opened up pauses in the chatter and let the noises of transmission contribute to the resonating sonic space. In other words, we engaged in the generation of consistency through techniques of group relation. This consistency began to aggregate as we paid attention to the rhythms of voice, network transmission, ambient sound and noise. We moved with this polyrhymicity and another kind of rhythm emerged that could not be heard but could certainly be felt.
