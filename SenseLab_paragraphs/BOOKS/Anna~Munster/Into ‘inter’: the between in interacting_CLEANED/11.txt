Many experiments from the late 1980s and ‘90s with online platforms for distributed communications generated a particular kind of experience for human participants, at once nonlocal and intensely embodied. What artistic online networking experiments initially made palpable was a kind of stumbling into relation with the differentials of technical speeds, geographical spatial dispersion and the life rhythms of participants in differing time zones. During this period, things, projects and online situations flowed into one another rapidly and moved on just as quickly, building density, intensities and rapid perishings. In discussing the experimental network of artists who gathered and performed using the first online real time multimedia collaborative performance software Keyworx, active between1997–2004, Sher Doruff, its designer, made a similar observation about distributed media and embodiment:
