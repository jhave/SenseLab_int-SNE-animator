In the Heideggarian tradition of conceptualising technology, which has dominated much critique of the Western understanding of technicality and its role in industrialised societies, the problem lies with the reduction of technology to instrumentality. Here, technologies are simply tools for getting things done. We may well agree that such critique of instrumentalism is still relevant for the present context of knowledge production. For Heidegger, the alternative lay with thinking through the ‘essence’ of technology; an essence that is not itself instrumental but can be found by delving into the concept of techne. Techne draws on the idea of both artisan and artistic techniques, crossing the spheres of manufacturing and industry (the techniques of shoemakers and printers, for example) and those of the arts, the techniques of poets and graphic designers, for example. It is "know-how”. But techne for Heidegger cannot be reduced to a making or instrumentation: "what is decisive in techne does not lie at all in making and manipulating nor in the using of means, but rather in the… revealing. It is as revealing, and not as manufacturing, that techne is a bringing-forth”(Heidegger, 2009.13). Heidegger wanted to restore an essence to technology, an essence that belonged to a transcendental field that is its truth. This field is the condition for the existence for any particular piece of technology whatsoever…techne as technique becomes a way of drawing forth this essence/truth.
