Contra this, in the radical empiricist mode of thinking, which emphasises the primacy of experience, technique is a matter of consistency.2 Here technique does not aim to reveal a generalizable truth but is operative in the creation of singularities. Technique occurs across all domains of organic and inorganic life – it is not special but it is practiced; it occurs everyday but must take all its pasts, its repetitions and its potentials for the next instantiation into account as it develops. Every technique is both singular and general, as Erin Manning suggests: ““There are techniques for hoeing, for standing at a bus stop, for reading a philosophical text, for taking a seat in a restaurant, for being in line at a grocery store” (2012: 33) There are particularities to standing in line – one stands up straight as one approaches the head of the queue at immigration control despite the jetlag setting in. But the queue is simultaneously a generalised composition where one is attended to one at a time. Specificity and generality imbricate each other in technique. To generate techniques is to already be in the middle of a complex ecology of practices that takes us outside of ourselves, placing us already in relationality. This state of middleness requires both cultivation and inhabitation of a specific space-time that we could call ‘betweenness’.
