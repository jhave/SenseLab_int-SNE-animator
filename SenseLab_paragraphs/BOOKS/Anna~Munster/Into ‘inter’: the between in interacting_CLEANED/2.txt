Material deposited in the wiki space and in external web publishing portals such as YouTube and Multiply was downloaded, reformatted (text was converted to audio, for example) and taken into VJing and DJing packages. It was then re-presented as two different remixes at ISEA 2006 (International Symposium of Electronic Arts), as the final performance/event of the ISEA Symposium. The process and event became a kind of machine that we called an Assemblage for Collective Thought (ACT). By ‘machine’ I mean something both technological and nontechnological. We were certainly using software and hardware – the wiki subtended by networked communications technologies and infrastructure. And the wiki was a fundamental component of that machine. It lent a specificity and consistency to the whole endeavor but this was not the element that made ACT a ‘machine’ in the sense I want to evoke this term: “It is the machine that is primary in relation to the technical element: not the technical machine, itself a collection of elements, but the social or collective machine, the machinic assemblage…”, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari suggest in their shattering of technological determinism (2005: 398).
