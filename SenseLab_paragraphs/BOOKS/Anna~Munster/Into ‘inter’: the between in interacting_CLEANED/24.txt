2. Radical empiricism is an approach that can be traced through the work of the pragmatist philosophers such as William James, Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Sanders Peirce to, especially, the activist philosophy of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. Pragmatism and its radical empiricist approach have been taken up recently through this genealogy by philosophers, media theorists and artists including: in my own work (Munster, 2013); Brian Massumi (2011); Erin Manning (2012); Isabelle Stengers (2011); and Adrian Mackenzie (2011) among many examples The approach today is best characterised as emphasising on relations as the ontogenesis of experience and of understanding aesthetics, politics, economies, socialities and so forth as complex relational and transversal assemblages.
