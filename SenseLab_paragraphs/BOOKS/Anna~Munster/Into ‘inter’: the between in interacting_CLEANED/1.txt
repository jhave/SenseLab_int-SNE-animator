Into ‘inter’: the between in interacting
In 2006, struggling to think collectively with both others and media, I got together with a group of 12 artists and writers, and a wiki. We hoped to engage in something process-oriented, networked and collaborative that took us away from our local ‘cartographies of exhaustion’, to borrow the title of Peter Pel Palbert’s book on affectivity and the ongoing states of crisis in our contemporary social and cultural milieus (2013). But we wanted also to remain focused, and develop consistency through process. We wanted media with which to conjoin not just as tools for interactions and to be invigorated as a result of our engagement. For a two-week period during June 2006, this group contributed to a structured wiki by responding to 'tasks' concerning collaborative thought, relations and art.
