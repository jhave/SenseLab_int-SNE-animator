Both Doruff and performers involved in this event and in the history of the Keyworx environment have spoken of the way in which translocality – that is, embodied distributed experience – amplified that embodiment, generating a ‘zone of the interval’ (Teran in Doruff, 2006: 132; Doruff, 2009: 27) Actual individual instances of such intervals are perceptible for audiences and performers alike in any networked performance event even at speeds of network transmission today and at current levels of performance and bandwidth. These occur as lags, feedback loops, overlays, repetitions and recursions of sound, image, movement and performative gestures. But the interval in collaborative, networked performance functions more fundamentally as a kind of consistency felt across bodies, media and the space-time of performance. The zone of the interval is grasped more at the level of an imperceptible yet felt experience: across, between, under and over direct visual, sonic or gestural manifestations of a meter, syncopation or delay. This consistency is a rhythm of relation: of the intersecting, overlapping and disjunctive forces at play in the event itself.
