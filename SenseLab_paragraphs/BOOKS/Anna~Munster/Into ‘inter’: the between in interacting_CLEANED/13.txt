In Interfacing/Radiotopia/Keyworx, a collaborative event using Keyworx at Dutch media festival DEAF, 2003, six performers were paired with each other between Rotterdam and New York where they engaged in ‘co-operative’ VJing.  In Rotterdam, in a proximate room with no visuals, the sound collective Radiotopia were simultaneously DJing samples of sound that had been uploaded by audiences in both cities and which were provided as noneditable audio streams to the six performers within the Keyworx software environment on their laptops. (Doruff, 2006:110ff). Audience members in both cities could also SMS short messages to the performers that appeared in a plugin within Keyworx for the performers. These were then filtered into ‘keywords’ by the plugin. The keywords became response points for the performers who, in real time, would remix the text with image and video synthesis through Keyworx, in relation to the streaming audio. A complex ecology for the event was at work. Not only are there human performing collaborators, media platforms and audiences in this mix but the design of the performance also harnessed the forces of network communications at their nonhuman technical level; that is, their capacity to generate relays and to unfold and refold information recursively.
