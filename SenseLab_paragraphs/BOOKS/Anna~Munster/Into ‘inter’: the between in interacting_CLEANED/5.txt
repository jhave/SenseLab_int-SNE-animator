In order to navigate this fluid and clunky mediatic terrain, the ACT group developed some techniques for collaboration that involved setting ‘tasks’ and ‘rules’. The closed and openendedness of the task and rule relationship formed the initial conditions for collaborative work to emerge. Instead of relegating engagement to the relation between interface and user, then, techniques became a kind of condition for and conditioning of interaction.  A technique is not disassociated from a technical element such as the software environment but it is not only about nor does it solely develop from this. A technique is also not simply imposed on bodies – human/nonhuman, organic/inorganic – but emerges in and of the relations of those bodies with each other and with other materialities such as computation, software and communications networks. A technique is not the opposite of improvisation, play or free form. Indeed, as I hope to suggest, the oscillating relations that form between technique and improvisation provide the conditions for machines to become generative and for collaborations to take off. Moreover, to set a technique up as conditioning interaction is to invert ordinary task and interface protocol. The derivative of a practice which should be passed on to operate between others, gains its own ontogenetic status, both enabling as Brian Massumi and Erin Manning put it (2014: 103), and constraining a practice to come.
