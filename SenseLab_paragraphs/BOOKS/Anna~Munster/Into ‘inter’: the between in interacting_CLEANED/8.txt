In media theory, still dominated by an information and communications paradigm, betweeness is often overlooked or passed over as getting across the divide between sender and receiver, encoder-decoder, user-computer takes precedence. Neither is betweeness given its due in theories or in a great many, especially HCI-oriented, practices of interface design (see, for example, Jacko and Sears, 2007). The point of the interface is to facilitate interaction between two pre-constituted endpoints. The interface as such is a point of contact for communication to flow across these givens. The point here is not to dwell in the middle, to dwell in relation but to resolve out toward the origin or endpoints of the flows. But what happens when the ‘inter’ shifts from this to and from set of flows toward a shifting topology of betweenness? To be sure, the inbetween is not an occupiable space but rather a dynamic and moving register of tendencies.
