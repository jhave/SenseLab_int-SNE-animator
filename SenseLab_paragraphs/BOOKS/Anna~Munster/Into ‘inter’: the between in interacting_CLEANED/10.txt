Before turning to these experiments, I will briefly touch on where this concept of immediation is heading since it is crucial to an understanding of the inter as between and the between as this register of dynamically moving intensive relations. All “media” enact and distribute real, embodied events. Such events cannot but be immediate – that is, they occur directly in experience as percepts. Yet percepts are complex and the work of immediating even more so. As William James argued, the percept’s immediate work is performed retroactively because it puts what is actually experienced in touch, retroactively, with a virtual or potential knowing of the something: “We were virtual knowers of the Hall long before we were certified to have been its actual knowers by the percept’s retroactive validating power” (1912; 68)
Immediation, then, occurs as the differential work accomplished across the seeing-knowing, actual-virtual relations and the intervals inhabiting such differentiations that comprise perceiving. All mediated perception is a kind of temporary concrescence of these lived immediating events. Television signal, for instance, involves the standardised interlacing of scanned lines at a particular rate. This scanning must hold at a particular rate for both actual human eyes and interlace/refresh at a particular speed in retroactive relation with each previous field instance in order to generate continuous ‘broadcast’ quality signal. It is the continuity of refreshing or the immediate relating across the different fields that produces the mediation that is television as percept. But not all media events provide events for encounters with the immediating processes of media. However, a certain attention to the production of intensities can allow an immediating aesthetics to come to the fore.
