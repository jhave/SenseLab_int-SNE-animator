Soft nerves, hard data
Both the uses of fMRIs as evidence of media changing brain structure and as imaging of the interiority of subjectivity in process raise a number of political and conceptual issues about the status and deployment of the neurological as material artifact, which I will return to later.  But for the moment I want to draw attention to how the diffuse mobilisation of techniques such as fMRI, signals an increasing turn toward the neural as a means of thinking, acting in, negotiating and shaping the contours of contemporary media and culture. Thought, focus, attention – especially of the so-called ‘iGeneration’ of 18-24 year-olds – and the synapses themselves have increasingly been characterised as deteriorating, in a state of crisis or under attack, targeted by economies, techniques and cultures of fragmenting and accelerating media.  Computational culture's revving up/dumbing down tendencies effect a significant shift, according to Carr, away from depth and substance toward the flatlands of surface insignificance, 'the shallows':
…our online habits continue to reverberate in the workings of our brain cells even when we’re not at a computer. We’re exercising the neural circuits devoted to skimming and multitasking while ignoring those used for reading and thinking deeply (Carr, 2010b)
