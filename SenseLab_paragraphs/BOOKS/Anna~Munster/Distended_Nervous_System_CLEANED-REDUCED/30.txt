Moreover, what an fMRI indicates is that we are in the middle of something. The image is not simply a tracing of action but a forwarding: this one fMRI snapshot refers to its others both captured and not captured (those that would have occurred in the 4-5 second gap between ‘snapshots’), and tells us something else will be about to have come. This is vitally important because if the fMRI indicates that the brain can change because of its exposure to media or because it is about to lie, it is because it indicates nothing more than that the brain is always changing, always in process – something to which rewiring and lying are likewise prone.  In a nontherapeutic context, the visual status of the fMRI must be seen more diagrammatically, ­less cartographically. Here I invoke Deleuze and Guattari’s sense of the operations of the diagram, that functions not simply on what is actually seen but what a diagram simultaneously virtually expresses: A diagram has neither substance nor form, neither content nor expression… A matter-content having only degrees of intensity, resistance, conductivity, heating, stretching, speed, or tardiness; and a function-expression having only "tensors", as in a system of mathematical, or musical, writing. (Deleuze and Guattari, 1987:162)
