The other turn that I want to chart in tandem with the above is the turn in networked media itself toward systems, tools and processes of what I will call 'neuro-perception'. This includes, for example, the development and implementation of Google's Prediction API tool (part of its self-conscious switch in systems development from 'search' to artificial intelligence), which is in effect a marriage of cloud computing with predictive AI. This is part of networked entities and corporationsâ€™ growth and use of data mining systems that learn from and model data in order to predict future directions. In fact, this turn has been taking place for some time. During the 1990s, when we were, on the one hand, experiencing an explosion in the life sciences and artificial life, artificial intelligence research was nevertheless ticking along. But as John Johnston has suggested, AI priorities shifted largely away from the construction of human-machine intelligence and the goal of creating an artificially intelligent 'mind', over to 'practical' applications for industry and for the military (Johnston, 2008: 386). A raft of 'smart applications' were tried and tested such as electronic fraud detection, voice and face recognition and data mining systems.
