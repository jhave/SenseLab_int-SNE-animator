This, too, signals a neural turn but a qualitatively different one from the idea that networks and media are rotting our brains. Rather, this r&d is imbricated in generating and deploying a distributed, networked architecture and infrastructure that still owes a debt to mid-twentieth century cybernetic insights. In particular, to Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts conception of the movement of the brain’s electrochemical impulses through neural circuits as a form of biological computation (1943:115–133).  Importantly, McCulloch and Pitts drew a formal analogy between the activity of neurons acting in neurophysiological networks in order to receive and transmit electrical signals and the ‘activity’ of logical propositions and their networks of relations:
The “all or none” law of nervous activity is sufficient to insure that the activity of any neuron may be represented as a proposition. Physiological relations existing among nervous activities correspond, of course, to relations among the propositions; and the utility of the representation depends upon the identity of these relations with those of the logic of propositions.
