If we were to deploy a Peircean semiotics here we could say that the fMRI is less indexical and more iconic. But to take this further, fMRIs comprise a special case of the icon: the diagram.  For Peirce, the icon was itself subsumed under the second category of his trichotomous classification of signs, in which signs were to be ordered by the ways they denoted their objects (Peirce, 1933: 243–63). Icons are a kind of sign, which share the qualities of their objects, such as resemblance. Diagrams are ‘in the main’ a kind of icon that resembles not the object itself but the relations necessary for generating an object (Peirce, 1933: 531). The Peircean diagram, while iconic, is not strictly speaking indexical as its mimetic properties are not caused by the object to which it refers (Peirce, 1933: 230). Peirce overlays image and object diagrammatically; the consistency of their resemblances lie not with cause but rather in the event of their overlay, or we might say, in their cross-processing.  We see in Peirce this discovery of the diagram as a method for moving reasoning away from embodying meaning or functioning as description, model or illustration, toward the diagrammatic as an event that generates novelty: ’A diagram is an icon or schematic image embodying the meaning of a general predicate; and from the observation of this icon we are supposed to construct a new general predicate.’ (Peirce, 1998: 303).  This also shifts the diagram away from representation of something toward a more ontogenetic or process-based generativity. Although this is not the place to conduct a sustained argument about the qualities of soft imaging, we could speculate as to whether any fundamentally nonoptically generated computational image – that is, imaging that is computed (rather than say scanned for optical information) as a function of mathematical transforms – is always nonrepresentational and comprised firstly of relations and then information or data.
