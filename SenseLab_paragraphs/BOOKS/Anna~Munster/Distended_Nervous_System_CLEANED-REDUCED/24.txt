Such a neuropolitics inhabits the deployment of neuro-images by those who both turn away from networked media and by the deployment of neouroimaging in social and cultural contexts to stake a claim on the pre-cognitive. By understanding the fMRI as a material assemblage of converging sociotechnical machines when deployed in such ways (that is, beyond its diagnostic uses), it is possible to trace just such relays between the molecular and molar at work in current neuropolitics.
