Google is not alone in using a branch of AI, specifically machine learning, to extract pattern from data; Facebook is also developing various aspects of pattern recognition including image, voice and facial recognition.4 In using a number of machine learning operations, particularly in Google’s development of its Prediction API and Facebook’s Generative Adversarial Nets approach, the research and development arms of these networked corporations have come to claim an expanding area of the neuro spectrum. The development of neural network-driven approaches to artificial intelligence expressly ties networked corporations’ research trajectories to a desire to become an information architecture functioning before we humans consciously think, search, act.  This area of the neuro spectrum, I will suggest later, is not so much the space where cognition is occurring but instead the territory of the pre-cognitive: that grey area of the ‘just before’ of consciousness and intentionality, and a space that networked corporations increasingly want to insinuate themselves. All those ‘we recommend’ emails, those ‘like’ icons and those privacy settings we forget to activate are harbingers of a ‘neuro-perceptual’ soft apparatus that will lay claim to know what we want to think, where we want to go, what we want to purchase before we do. As it turns out, then, the neurological turn against contemporary media may have little impact on the same media’s overall predilections for an increasing share of the neuro spectrum’s bandwidth.
