Abstract
This chapter locates two neurological turns: one against networked media in recent critiques of the internet by, for example, Nicholas Carr; the other in networked media R&D departments such as Google and Facebook using machine learning and data mining and deploying techniques of ‘neuro-perception’. What is at stake in these turns and why do they radically miss yet implicitly complement the culture and politics of each other? I trace the different neuropolitics at work here via the materialities of fMRIs and their strategic deployment by all networked corporations and their critics. I also ask how we might unfold images of the brain differently, shifting them from their indexical status of revealing ‘neural correlates’ toward a more diagrammatic rendering of a dynamic, machinic brain.
