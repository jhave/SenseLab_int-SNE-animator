Despite having celebrated ‘the decade of the brain’ from 1990–1999, Catherine Malabou reminds us that we still do not know what we should do with our brains (2008). Yet philosophy is perhaps confronting such risks too late, as an entire technics of search, query, databasing, pattern matching and machine learning is already attempting to determine what our brains must do. Such a technics seeks out that share of mind that is nonconscious, staking a claim on what we should be thinking and feeling, how we should be behaving, before we register that this entanglement is something we might desire.
