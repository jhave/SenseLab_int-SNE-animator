These remain areas of neuroscientific dispute. But what we can be sure we are not seeing in those colour patches is a neuron, a wire, a circuit, a network or a restructure of structure itself. We are looking at a mathematically inflected (ratio of increase to decrease), re-coloured, afterimage selected out of dynamic processuality. Interestingly, the more the fMRI becomes visual (and especially when it statically becomes  ‘an’ image or even two comparable images as in Small’s study), the less indexical it can be said to be, given that its initial data comprises signal generated by relations imputed to wave differentials. As ‘an’ imaging of the brain, then, we need to understand the final startling ‘images’ that purport to locate emotions, states and changes as datasets of transduced cross-processed signal. What is important in this cross-processing for neurosicentific (medical and radiographic, that is) diagnosis via neuroimaging, is that relations between data variables such as frequency, amplitude and position are maintained in the transduction. The fMRI is therefore quite far removed from a pictorial semiosis structured by the relation between a signifier and signified (referent) and much more akin to a topological mode of constituting an image. That is, the relations in the set (of data) are maintained although the data is itself transduced and deformed.
