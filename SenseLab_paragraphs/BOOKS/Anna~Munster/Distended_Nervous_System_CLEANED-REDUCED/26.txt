In No Lie MRI’s description of its product online, it tempts us with the capture of a lie as it happens, by providing a kind of stop-frame animation version of the fMRI sequence.  Although this could be viewed as an extension of the before and after technique, what is going on here is different from the Small study. Here we are in the midst of capturing process: ‘Differential activation during the telling of a lie’ (ref). The mode of attention being captured here is infinitesimally more fleeting and faster than the voluntary decision to click on a web link from Small’s study. No LIE MRI lays claim to image/capture the brain during the unfolding of intentionality; that is, its promise rests upon the delivery of real time image processing of the pre-voluntary. It seeks to capture the movement and change that takes place as the nonconscious intention to not tell the truth is neurally initiated. It stakes this claim on the belief that what the fMRI captures are the micro-processes of neurological change itself such as neural firing.
