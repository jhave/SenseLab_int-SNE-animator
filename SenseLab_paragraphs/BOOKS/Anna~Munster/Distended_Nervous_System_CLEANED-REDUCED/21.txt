But there’s more than a turn here and more at stake than a difference in neurological model and application.  There’s a staggering leap. How did we travel from pattern to prediction? How is it that for networked media corporations like Google, Facebook and Amazon search and browsing and social media are morphing into forms of AI that anticipate your next move? And what implications does this assemblage of ‘machine-us’ intelligence, riding the slippery slope of the predictive, have for the molecularity of thought and perception and, equally, for its molar socio-technical conjunctions? Networked media are largely made of/by us – the product of our connective, informatic cognitive musings in online space. As we contribute content, we make, for instance, a ‘Google-us’ earth.8  But we also discard the integrity of our ‘selves’ ‘minds’ ‘actions’, as molecules of our exoskeleton are divested and become not ours. Importantly, alongside the amorphousness of such entanglements, we may well feel ambivalent about such networked corporation’s shift to an AI that predicts what we want to do next. We have previously imagined artificially intelligent entities – benign or malevolent as agents.6 But we hadn’t culturally configured an AI so distributed and diffuse yet so modulating of both cognition and perception. We hadn’t perhaps dreamt of neuro-perception as the emerging vector guiding networked corporations.
