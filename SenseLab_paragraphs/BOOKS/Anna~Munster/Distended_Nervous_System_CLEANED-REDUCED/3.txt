Take, for example, Google’s aspirations beyond its constitution as the ‘ultimate’ search engine. Its construction of and investment in ‘the future’ rests on its capacity to reterritorialise this proto-mind space. This reterritorialisation is attempted via a raft of machine learning techniques from data mining to dataset training, which claim to reveal dimensions of thought and behaviour.1 This move away from search per se toward prediction of what “users” desire before they even know what they want signals an insidious foray into the nonconscious and affective terrain of precognition and all its inbetweenness. Networked platforms and corporations thus turn toward systems, tools, and processes of what I call “neuro-perception”; that is, a paradigm of perception that sees human thought and action proceeding from the reterritorialisation of the precognitive and pre-perceptual by the research and development vectors of contemporary networked corporations (Munster, 2013: 126–129). The occupation of the ‘neural’ through an entire technics of machine learning, data mining and artificial intelligence emanating from networked corporations, lays claim to what are actually the indeterminate nonpredictive capacities of organic neurobiological processes. In neuroscience this nonpredictability is everywhere referred to as the brain’s plasticity.
