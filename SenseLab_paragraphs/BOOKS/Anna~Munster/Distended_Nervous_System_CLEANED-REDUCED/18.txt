This vector of distributed and networked intelligence is at work in the current research and development of networked corporations such as Google as it transforms search mechanisms into a much further reaching ever-present, predictive form of AI. As Eric Schmidt has more recently claimed: “We're still happy to be in search, believe me. But one idea is that more and more searches are done on your behalf without you needing to type…I actually think most people don't want Google to answer their questions, …They want Google to tell them what they should be doing next." (Schmidt quoted in Jenkins, 2010)
