Although concurring with his questions, I nonetheless think we need to be simultaneously asking specific questions about the neural micro-politics at play here and to try to figure out their conjunctions and relays with molar dimensions of the economic and political. Stiegler’s critique of contemporary media, to be fair, does take aim at psychopower and its ‘noopolitics’. He argues that the consumer or market-related elements of contemporary biopower – including such phenomena as neural marketing and the pharmacological economies and subjectivations produced such as Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) in children – operate at the level of ‘attention capture’ (2010, 90ff; 2008). But how does attention get captured? What are the technics of this capture? What indeed might a more networked or ecological understanding of and approach to media and to the media artefacts of neuroscience bring to understanding the capturing, sequestering and inflecting of attention? William Connolly’s nomenclature of ‘neuropoltics’ is more useful than Stiegler’s noopolitics because it gets at the transversal and dynamic meshwork of neurological, affective, perceptual, cognitive and socio-technical components at stake in thinking through what thought might be in relation to contemporary culture and politics: …the inventive and compositional dimensions of thinking are essential to freedom of the self and to cultivation of generosity in ethics and politics. Thinking participates in that uncertain process by which new possibilities are ushered into being. (Connolly, 2002:1)
