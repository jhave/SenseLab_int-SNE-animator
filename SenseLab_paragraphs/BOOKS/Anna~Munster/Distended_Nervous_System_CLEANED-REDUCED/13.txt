For those at the alarmist end of the turn to the neurological in media analysis, the software and hardware of media technologies are literally turning our 'wetware' to mush and bloating rather than extending our central nervous system.
 
The most strident of these claims – particularly by Carr, Greenfield, and earlier Wolf as to the actual 're-wiring' of the brain's structure by exposure to the computer screen and internet – also signals a turn away from contemporary media technologies and culture. Both Stiegler and Hayles' arguments are more nuanced. Nonetheless they conjoin with Carr and Greenfield inasmuch as the vector they follow deploys neuroscience evidentially yet simultaneously deploys nebulous 'entities' such as 'the mind', 'attention' 'generations' 'youth' and 'the internet'. But it is precisely the unproblematic unity and homogeneity of such entities that is questioned by a number of contemporary neuroscientists: Vilanyur Ramachandran’s behavioural neurology or Steven Rose’s neurobiology, for example.6 It is important, then, to pay attention to the variety of neuroscience being evoked in nonscientific turns to the neurological against networked media.
