Turning ‘neuro’ across the neural spectrum
Over the last few years, ‘the neurological turn’ in humanities and social science discourses has gathered speed, particularly in analyses of screen and new media technologies and reception. By neurological turn, I am referring mainly to the resort to neuroscience by nonscientists, journalists and commentators as evidence of the ways in which, variously, the internet, gaming, screens in general, databases and artificial intelligence, as well as all manner of informatic devices are changing the ‘wiring’ in our brains. Probably the best known of these turns has been the journalistic writing of Nicholas Carr, whose article for the Atlantic magazine, ‘Is Google Making Us Stupid? What the Internet is doing to our brains’ (Carr, 2008a) was so widely discussed in both print media and the blogosphere that it garnered its own Wikipedia entry.2  Observing that his own reading habits seemed to have changed as a result of constant skimming and hyperlinking in the online context, Carr, in spite of making his name as a blogger/journalist, bemoaned the loss of meditative, deep thought about the world, ‘Once I was a scuba diver in the sea of words. Now I zip along the surface like a guy on a Jet Ski.’(2008a) Although in this initial article, Carr did not offer any neuroscientific evidence for the rewiring that was apparently taking place in his grey matter, synapses, he referred to the work of Maryanne Wolf, which itself sits on the spectrum of neuro-turning. A developmental psychologist, Wolf also worried about our failing capacities to think and read with any depth in an age of surface-oriented media (2007). Carr later went on to develop his argument to his book, The Shallows (2010a) armed with a swathe of neuroscientific ‘evidence’ demonstrating the internet’s neuroanatomical impact. Furnishing images of the brain gleaned from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies taken in vivo while the subjects of experiments surfed the net, Carr drew on work conducted by psychiatrists who are likewise convinced of the impact of contemporary technologies on our ‘wiring’ seem like incontrovertible truth of a rapid rewiring. 3
