As a record of process, of something that is in the middle, and about to be, the fMRI is indicative of a changing brain as it mobilises the subject in order to not speak the truth. The claim made by a company such as No Lie fMRI that an fMRI visualises anticipation, indicates the ways in which the neurological image also comes to occupy space similar to Google’s predictive software research and development on the continuum of a cultural ‘neuralism’. But as we shall also see, fMRIs are not visual images in the same way that even the digital photograph, is a visual image. As its name states, the fMRI is a functional image; that is, it dynamically images cerebral blood activity as a function of time. When we simply compare a before and after image, as Carr’s referencing of Small’s study reenacts, we freeze frame the functional and durational aspects of this imaging process and focus instead on what comparisons the two images seem to morphologically proffer (Dumit, 1999: 187–89). If we want to deploy fMRIs in a nontherapeutic and cultural context, we must be savvier with our relation to the more dynamic and plastic character of these complex, computational artifacts.
