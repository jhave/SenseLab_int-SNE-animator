Thinking an image diagrammatically, then, draws attention to its potential unfoldings not all of which will in actuality unfold. For Deleuze and Guattari, the diagram has a processual aesthetic that lies in its assembling of intensive elements. We might try to conceive the mode of imaging that an fMRI produces differently by following these diagrammatic axes, when we see them deployed in social and cultural contexts. This would require transversally drawing out the virtualities rather than representational vectors of neural processes: the brain looks like its moving toward this but may also be moving toward that; there’s a burst of activity here but then nanoseconds later there’s another burst elsewhere. We would have to think the still neural image as always already moving. Whereas the fMRI when presented as a single image of brain change traces activity that’s occurred, if re-imagined as a tracing of process it could also sketch a virtual future, moving us forward indeterminately to what might be unfolding multifariously somewhere else.
