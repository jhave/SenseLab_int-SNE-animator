Conjunctive and Disjunctive Networks: Affects, Technics, and Arts in the Experience of Relation
“The Internet is over,” Prince famously proclaimed in an interview with the British newspaper, The Daily Mirror, in 2010. Comparing the entire way in which music distribution and marketing had fallen into the “middling” hands of both networked corporations and downloaders to the grip and branding filter that MTV held over pop music during the 1980s and ’90s, Prince’s declaration was naïve and savvy at the same time. The sheer statistics, the growth, and now diversification of platforms and apps such as Reddit, Instagram, and Snapchat, which circulate memes, stories, images, and commentary on popular music, would suggest that online networking is the main environment for music distribution and consumption. And yet Prince’s characterization of the internet as control space for audiovisual content, similar to MTV’s tight grip over the marketing of popular music’s image, is interesting. According to Prince, by 2010 the internet was no longer a space for directly networking one’s music with one’s audience, because it had become an environment in which direct connectivity was no longer possible.
