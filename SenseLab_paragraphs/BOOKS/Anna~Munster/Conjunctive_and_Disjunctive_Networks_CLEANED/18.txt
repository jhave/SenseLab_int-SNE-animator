James’s vocabulary for theorizing experience is scattered with images and processes that are well suited to thinking through network relations as diffuse generators and shapers of contemporary experience. For him, experience is loosely wrought; hanging together through relations of proximity between things and beings as these bump up together, pass into one another, settle, and transition (1977: 256 –269; 1912: 43–56). James’s emphasis on relations as the most immediately felt or sensed aspect of experience lead him to how conjunctions and disjunctions operate as events that qualitatively contour relations: “If I ask you where some object of yours is, our old Memorial Hall, for example, you point to my Memorial Hall with your hand which I see” (James 1912: 79). Here, “with,” “my,” “your,” – but also the concepts of proximity and distance with which James is dealing when he discusses both seeing and remembering Memorial Hall – are not subjects, objects, or points to be measured and connected. They are all relations that fundamentally impinge on, modulate, and organize even the seemingly simplest of experiences. In such an everyday experience, we can see the germs of a process-oriented mode of engaging with the world functioning on a different plane than connecting the nodes. In more recent aesthetic, philosophical and political theory (for example, Massumi, 2011: Lapoujade 2000, this emphasis on conjunctions and disjunctions as the critical operators that bring the political, social and cultural spheres along with the more mico-dimensions of perceptual and affective experience together, is known as “relationality”.
