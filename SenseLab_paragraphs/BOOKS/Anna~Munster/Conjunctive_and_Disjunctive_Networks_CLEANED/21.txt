How, for example, can we understand the deformations that the moving image and moving image culture undergo in networked culture in a way that accounts for the complexity of the conjunctions or relations the moving image now has? Such conjunctions include, but are not limited to, cinema’s relations with different media delivery and distribution platforms; the engagement of amateurs and fans with image, merchandise and the cultivation of audiences; the global uptake of the moving image in local contexts; and the differentials of labor for the film industry that such globalization has generated. Cinema has not only materially transformed but has become a wholly different kind of movement—literally from moving image to streaming data. And this shift—material, formal, and operational all at the same time—opens a complex reassembling of the political economy of images, of new publics and modes of producing the moving image—indeed, of new kinds of labor that provide the condition and engine for making streams of images. A conception of the network as an online or even offline set of links and nodes to account for such relationality simply will not wash.
