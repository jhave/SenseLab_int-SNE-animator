There are a myriad of other tales to tell about network experience that fall somewhere else than one side or other of the utopian/dystopian divide. During the 1990s, artists and writers were eager to crawl on, slip into, and fall down any cyber-hole that would lead them into shared networked spaces, projects, and discussions. Such falls were often quite literal. In connecting to LambdaMOO, for example, a text-based multiuser online environment and community set up in the early 1990s by Pavel Curtis at Xerox PARC, one entered its topography through a text-based description of a space called “the Closet.” A dark and confined “rabbit hole,” players experienced the feeling of bumping up against hanging coats, boots, and sometimes other online sleeping denizens, before navigating in a fumbling fashion using the @ command into other “rooms” in the environment (see Quittner 1994). “The Closet” opened out into a “Living Room” where other players in the community also hung out. Another potential encounter in the “Living Room” was with a “magical” couch that frequently caused players’ objects to fall through it. All such falls, encounters, and spaces occurred via typed text descriptions, @ commands, and dialogue generated by members. I was first shown how to log on to LambdaMOO by the artist, Francesca da Rimini, who, at that time and across much of the 1990s and into the 2000s, fell in and out of various online environments, avatars, and communities and had been part of VNSMatrix. These four women, seriously and with a dash of humor, described their online and digital mission to be “terminators of the moral code, mercenaries of slime” (VNS Matrix, 1991).
