Transformers: The Premake is not simply a critique of how the fan labor of capturing and uploading snippets of upcoming film releases feeds global media franchises such as Hollywood cinema. The compositional techniques deployed by Lee both trace standard online geotagging/mapping visualization practices and provide a sense of the rhythms and intensities that translocally straddle and propel networked aesthesia. At 5’22” into his video, Lee scrubs across a map of the U.S. populated by clusters of fan videos assembled according to sites where the actual Transformers movie was being shot. We move from Monument Valley in Utah, with only one fan video, to Texas, with eight fan videos, then on to Detroit, with a thriving cluster of 115 fan videos. Skipping quickly from Washington state  (with only one fan video), we are suddenly propelled halfway across the globe to Hong Kong, where production on the movie gathered 52 fan videos in its wake.
