Prince is not the only one to have declared the demise of a certain kind of “direct” online connectivity. Fifteen years earlier, in an opinion piece published for Newsweek in 1995, Clifford Stoll—systems administrator and author of The Cuckoo’s Egg (1989), a myopic into his stalking of a KGB hacker—had already bemoaned the chaotic and unedited realm of voices that online interactions had become. Although Stoll saw chaos and chatter, where Prince decried the presence of opaque middleware, a similar sentiment pervades their views on the culture and enterprise of going online—the lack of authentic personal contact and connectivity. More recently, Andrew Keen steadfastly criticized the internet for its celebration of narcissism and self-expression and its lack of authentic connection with other minds (2015, 2007). Prince, Stoll, and Keen all represent quite different positions on the massification of networked cultures and economies. But they also indicate that, for at least twenty years, online culture has felt as if it were already an environment in which corporatism, middleware, and other forms of “RL” organization were already facets of its terrain. The internet had fast become an environment consistently failing to live up to the utopian ideals of its early advocates, such as Stuart Brand and Larry Brilliant, who founded the WELL (Whole Earth ’Lectronic Link), one of the earliest online communities, in 1985.
