The link-node image is one in which “nodes” are given substantive status – they are treated as objects or subjects that have already formed, such as “friends” in a social media network, and just need to be added in to the network. A process-oriented approach that takes relations as the real generators of experience instead suggests that “nodes” are only produced by and through their relations. A “friend” in a social network is therefore something much more fleeting and in a state of ongoing composition in relation to a range of both technocultural forces as well as microsocial online comings and goings.  A process-oriented approach to networking offers us a way out of the hold the link-node network image has on contemporary social imagining. Attending carefully to the materialities of such relationality—rather than to the scale-free (see Barabasi and Bonabeau, 2003: 52) and somewhat anchorless link-node model—is key to contemporary networked cultures.
