An aesthesia, I think, might tentatively hold in the same moment an oscillating tension between numbness, boredom, and the predictability of a template or connectivity on the one hand, and the intensive joy of networking as a shared event of translocal relation, on the other. It speaks to the diffuse creep of the connective edge that is constantly “liking,” “predicting,” and “capturing” across social media, network architectures, and logistical chains—an advance of nodes and edges that is anaesthetizing. But it also speaks to edging as a process of inventing, often via aesthetic techniques, new modalities of relation that bring us into as yet unknown assemblages with the nonhuman, the more-than-human, and the infrahuman. A network aesthesia, rather than “anaesthesia” might allow us to not count the already similar, already nodal but encounter what we do not know, sense, or own—the imperceptible. Such an aesthesia also requires us to rethink the movements of networks: a shift away from connectivity toward conjunction and its companion, disjunction.
