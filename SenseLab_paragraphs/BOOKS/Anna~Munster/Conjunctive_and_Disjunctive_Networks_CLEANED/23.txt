Lee recomposes all this content and its various networked platforms and processes via screen casting software. This approach captures and remakes all his searching, querying, and downloading into a relentlessly smooth stream, and brings this labor together with the aggregates of creative fan labor (Deuze, 2007: 57) manifest in the YouTube clips themselves. All these amateur clips of the making of the Transformers movie, as well as Lee’s “premake,” appeared online before the release of the Hollywood film in cinemas. This timing is crucial. Lee’s desktop documentary foregrounds this “pre-production” as not simply medial background to contemporary cinema but as the affective surplus labor produced in advance and retrospectively parasited in the generation of audiencesfor the Hollywood release.
