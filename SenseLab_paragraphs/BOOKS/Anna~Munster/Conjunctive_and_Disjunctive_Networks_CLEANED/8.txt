Critique and creation co-existed. VNSMatrix, for example, were both infiltrators and critics of spaces they perceived to be already over-determined by sexism, “mainframeism,” and a palpable sense of alignment between the life worlds of geek, hacker masculinity, and computation. List networks on network culture were at once generative and damning of network forces, online governance structures, and emergent corporate forms of computational and technical capitalism. A generation of “net” artists such as Heath Bunting, Olia Lialina, and jodi.org made work online that already engaged with the heterogeneity of networks as simultaneously “open” and proprietorial, available technically to the amateur and hobbyist and imbued with a technical episteme indebted to a cold war legacy.
