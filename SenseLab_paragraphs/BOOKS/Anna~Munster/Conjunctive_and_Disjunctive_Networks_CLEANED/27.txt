In my analysis of online videos that go viral, I have suggested that: 
Something elusive moves and moves us; something not quite quantifiable is generated when these videos are uploaded and then circulate through networks. Something that is felt, shared, and spread through online audiences and networks. Something that does not yet have substance, even so, has force. As these viral videos go viral, they become an element at work in the individuation of networked affectivity. They enable a collective (heterogeneous) capacity to affect and be affected in online networks. (Munster 2013: 103)
A similar, infectious affectivity inhabits Lee’s Premake. Although the affectivity of fan labor generates a pool of marketing potential for the Hollywood system, it also creates a perspective on cities, habitation, and everydayness in networked cultures that reveals an eye for quirkiness among audiences/citizens. This quirkiness, together with the polyrhymicity of YouTube media and practices of social imagining, ensure the networked imagination cannot simply settle for an image of connectivity. The “join”—the passing of one experience into or across to another—is the process that shifts us from a “network” to qualitative networking. There is still an open proposition at work for inflecting the qualities of relations, for contouring the rhythms, refrains, and passages toward aesthesias of networks.
