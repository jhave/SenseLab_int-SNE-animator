Instead, we should look to artists in tandem with sociotechnical and process-based thinkers, all of whom are particularly good at touching upon the complexity of such experience and rendering the conjunctions and disjunctions of networking as dilatory and contracted openings. Take, for example, Kevin Lee’s Transformers: The Premake (a desktop documentary), an online video originally posted to Vimeo in 2014 (Lee 2014). Here, Lee literally creates a whole new possibility for a networked genre—the desktop documentary—that emerges as a conjunction of disjunctive online visual culture sources, environments, platforms, and techniques. Trawling through 355 YouTube videos shot by fans and amateurs (including himself) of the shooting and production of Transformers: Age of Extinction (Michael Bay, dir. 2014), Lee unleashes and contours a set of problems around media, labor, and affective capitalism in funny and poignant ways. Not only do these YouTube clips reappear in Lee’s documentary, but they are composed into his process of actually searching for and watching online videos. They are also composited against and with other online platforms, such as Google Maps, to provide a kind of post-narrative “plot”—made possible by the ubiquity of tracking provided by network metadata—of where, when, and how fans captured material about the making of a Hollywood blockbuster.
