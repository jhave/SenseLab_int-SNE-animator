On the one hand, we get the sense that the art of Hollywood filmmaking travels smoothly across global spaces with little care for the specificities of the places in which it lands—these are all just cities that offer the producers tax breaks and concessions. On the other hand, the spatial montage of fan videos laid out as a grid within each city gives a sense of the city itself being filmed through the pulsing polyrhythmic activities of its citizens and fans on their mobile phones. We scrub across to Detroit’s mosaicked grid of fan videos, and the cityscape feels momentarily animated, alive across the flickering of moving images. This is quickly juxtaposed against its ruined urban infrastructure, as Lee selects two fan videos among the grid and zooms in to reveal Transformers being shot in a landscape of burnt-out, vacant blocks. That urban setting is the reality of a city that has been ravaged the shift from an industrial economy to a networked service industry. Even the movie industry will not save it. While not for a moment idealizing the vitality of all this creative labor undertaken by fans, Transformers: The Premake nonetheless refuses to cede its affectivity to the appetite of the Hollywood franchise. Something remains: a kind of glimpse into the ways in which imploded cities might nonetheless hold intensities and vitalities—still generate other modes of living through the rhythms and everyday media practices of their inhabitants. Lee both pools the videos together and assigns them to city sites; he draws us into the rhythms that pulse across and between each city grid, across a global network. He plunges us into the quirkiness of a single fan’s capture of the production of Transformers.
