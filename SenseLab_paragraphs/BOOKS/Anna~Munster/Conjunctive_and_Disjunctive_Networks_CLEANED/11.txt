What online networking experiments initially made palpable was a kind of stumbling into relation with the differentials of technical speeds, geographical spatial dispersion, and the life rhythms of differing time zones. Things, projects, and online experiences both flowed into one another rapidly and moved on just as quickly, building dense intensities and rapid perishings. In spite of all proclamations about the demise of the internet—whether these have to do with a loss of immediacy or melancholia about the ceding of political ideals to communicational capitalism—the potential to generate novel technosocial and techno-aesthetic events continues for contemporary networked experience.
