The 2013 TED talk in which Sergey Brin, Google founder, infamously fumbled between his phone and pocket, on the one hand, and smoothly and transparently slid from Glass to its transducer behind his ear, on the other, was revealing of his ‘vision’ for the next phase of the corporation’s R&D. Brin stated that his vision for Google was eventually for its engine to be “queryless” – information would just come to you when you needed it. Indeed there would be no ‘future’ ­– in the sense of indeterminacy – for query, because the potential to vary, to be different and, moreover, to change one’s mind while thinking, would never be activated. Information would just arrive.
