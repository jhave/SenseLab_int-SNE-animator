In 2008, researchers from the Max Planck Institute used fMRIs to watch in vivo brain activity of participants making decisions to push a button randomly in either their left or right hands. The findings were startling, revealing that brain activity began in different regions of the prefrontal and parietal cortex –depending on whether the final decision was a left or right push outcome – up to 10 seconds before it entered awareness for the subject. The researchers concluded that the delay presumably reflected the operation of a network of high-level control areas that began to prepare an upcoming decision long before it entered awareness.
