John-Dylan Haynes, one of the 2008 researchers suggests instead that the ‘neural patterning’ and awareness of a decision might be more fruitfully understood as both a continuum and in relations of feedback with each other: If we find that a persons’s thoughts are very closely encoded in their brain activity, we can’t make a distinction between these thoughts and the brain activity. We don’t need to assume that they’re two separate entities existing in two different spaces. (Haynes, 2009)
