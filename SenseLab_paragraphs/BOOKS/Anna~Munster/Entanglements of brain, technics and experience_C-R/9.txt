However, prediction is good for business.  A good example of the contemporary “predictive” trend (and an attempt to capture the vagueness of ‘potential’) is the development and implementation of Google’s Prediction API tool. This tool forms part of the networked corporation’s self-conscious development from “search” toward artificial intelligence and marries cloud computing with predictive AI. Both Prediction API and the shift to prediction as the ultimate goal for Google search are indicative of a disposition toward capturing and reterritorializing the radical potential of distributed (neuro)architectures. Like any API, the heart of this application is source code that allows for certain kinds of communication functions to occur on or between components of a database. In the case of the Prediction API, these functionalities allow for pattern matching and machine learning. AS Eric Scmidt, Google’s CEO famously stated:
I actually think most people don't want Google to answer their questions… They want Google to tell them what they should be doing next. (Schmidt, E, 2010)
