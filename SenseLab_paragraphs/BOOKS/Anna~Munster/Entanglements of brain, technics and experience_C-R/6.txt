For Libet, these subjective referrals would appear to be purely a mental function with no corresponding neural basis in the brain: [...] My view of mental subjective function is that it is an emergent property of appropriate brain functions. The conscious mental cannot exist without the brain processes that give rise to it. However, having emerged from brain activities as a unique 'property' of that physical system, the mental can exhibit phenomena not evident in the neural brain that produced it (Libet, 2004: 86â€“87)
