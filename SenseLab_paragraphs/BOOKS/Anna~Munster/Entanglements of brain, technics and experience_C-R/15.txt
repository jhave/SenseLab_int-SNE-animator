Google’s Glass brings prediction and information together in a singular capture of immediation – and I mean immediation rather than mediation – such that future thought is made to unfold with certainty in the now. Such technologies must be thought of as new kinds of media, perhaps we can call these postmedia insofar as what is at stake is a direct and immediate lived experience of their technicity. Technologies of transmission and broadcast – television, radio and to an extent much of our previous experience of the internet at our desktops and some of our prior experience of mobile interaction – operate by mediation. This is most often achieved via the hypermediated functioning of screens, speakers, headphones, touchpads and so on. However, technologies and platforms such as SMS messaging, touchscreen interfaces, immersive environments, digital assistants and now the full platform of Google Glass offer experiences of immediation in which technology, body and environment co-modulate at ever faster speeds. (In fact, it could also be argued that any mediation is always already an immediation at a micro-perceptual level).
