I have already suggested that the wiki in this project was a collaborator; it was certainly not a mediator and it never functioned as the interface with which to ‘interact’ for the project. Wikis are notoriously clunky deriving from a history of web development from the mid-1990s when graphic interface browsers became available. They retain a kind of clumsiness in their simultaneous nested and somewhat hierarchical management of user permissions and content coupled together with their authorlessness. Contributing to and editing a wikipage involves writing over, alongside and against all the other authors who are members of that wiki. This inevitably produces varying degrees of frustration and elation when contributions are lost or transformed by other collaborators. The wiki platform generates an odd temporality, too, in which all versions of contribution can be re-accessed (restored, if necessary) and yet the immediate page on which work is being carried out tends to become the one that holds sway…until the next edit!
