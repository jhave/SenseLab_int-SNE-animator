In a rather different performative collaboration, Nathaniel Stern’s ongoing project Compressionism (2005 and ongoing), expands the ecological field to incoporate the nontechnical nonhuman as well. In this image-composition project, Stern has worked to open up a new field of expression for the digital image. He straps a desktop scanner, laptop and battery pack to his body and moves across and with his body and surrounds, ‘performing’ as he puts it, images into existence (Stern, 2005 and ongoing). For Stern, these images are not an end point; rather they allow for crystallisations of dynamics and momentary captures of relationality. These dynamics play off and across the bodies forming through the work, the digital technologies and the milieus that become part of the ecology. They embrace the particularities of a human body moving – its gait, its flexibility, its strength and weaknesses, its energies. The scanning-body here is a technical body – not because it has become cyborgian and assimilated digital technologies nor because it has acquiesced to a transhumanist fantasy of computational disembodiment. It is a technical body because it has practiced and cultivated a technique of moving-with that listens to and transforms in relation to the technological speeds of the scanning software and hardware and the speeds and durations of its surrounds. This moving-with marks the practice as collaborative, where collaboration takes into account the capacity to affect and be affected by all elements, from the technologies, through to rocks and water and Stern’s body.
