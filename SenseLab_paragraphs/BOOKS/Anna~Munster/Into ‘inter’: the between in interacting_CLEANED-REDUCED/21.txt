In the process of diagramming one of Guattariâ€™s diagrams, this force took off and became diagrammatic, something with its own tendencies and movement that moved us. An email would be sent out from someone who gifted the newly (re)generated diagram onwards to another all the while allowing the new diagram to unfold in relation to an aspect of thinking through something of a section of the Guattari text. At no point did this process constitute a remix, unless one wants to radically rethink the concept of remix as novel generativity. The force of the diagramming never paused with a remaking, but rather created novel avenues into thinking textually, manually and aesthetically.
