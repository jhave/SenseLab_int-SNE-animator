A machine, whether technical or not, is a generative arrangement of heterogeneous components – people, affects, socialities, economics, technical elements, nonhuman organic and inorganic contributors all constitute the relational assemblage. In ACT, what was assembling itself via process, experiment and technique was a little machine for collaborative thought. That experience of working with others, a wiki, with states of exhaustion and exhilaration was important in my future explorations and engagements with collaboration and media. Such experiences have provided me with techniques and modes of thinking the forces of media, bodies and affect as unruly yet welcome associates and for discovering the conditions for making such assemblages and interactions generative. This generativity gives rise to an embodied or felt sense of engagement in which making, especially media-making, becomes joyful and where the process is ongoing, facilitating the next mode or entry point for re-engagement. Sher Doruff, an artist who has worked with media art and collaboration for over three decades calls this generativity “event-value” in contradistinction to the exchange value of commodified forms of art output and practice.
