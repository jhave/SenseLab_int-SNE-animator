In one crystallization of this project, Rippling Images (2014), Stern worked with a human team to construct a marine-rated scanning rig in order to scuba-dive a coral reef and perform the scans in relation with a marine ecology. Engaged in this image-making process for a decade, Stern also works with a range of other media and collaborators. But he notes the importance of longevity in the cultivation of a practice, for here a technique is able to emerge. Technique that is not oriented toward perfection but rather to the full range of affectivities that can ripple through a project, including slowness, failure and collapse of the technologies in relation to both body and surrounds. He says of the underwater scanning performances: “Everything leaked, everything broke, nothing did what I wanted or expected: and this is precisely what must have happened…” (2014). Stern’s techniques enable a new expressive field for the digital image through the cultivation of rhythm as it creates a moving-with between human and nonhuman milieus.
