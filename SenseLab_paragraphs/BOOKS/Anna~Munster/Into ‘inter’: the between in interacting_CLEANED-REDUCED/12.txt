…translocal experience, as an embodied experience, is amplified because your body is … you have the sensation of … how can I say this? The effect of intensities of translocal performance when it’s indeterminate and you’re collectively negotiating and making choices together and you’re playing off those choices as a jazz band would or as a dancers might … the translocal becomes incredibly, intensely physicalised, but your feeling of space is non-locally oriented (Doruff and Murphie, 2012)
It is important to understand that the Keyworx environment operated during a period when most people would have sworn that real time collaborative networked streaming and performative media environments were a dream of a utopian wired-up future. But these were not high tech hardware performance events, although the Keyworx platform consisted of highly customised and intricately coded software. Performers and media operated with ordinary, publicly available bandwidth and packet switching networks, with all the delays, blips, and glitches of the networking of that time. Indeed, these features of networked transmission became collaborative and affective elements in the improvisations themselves.
