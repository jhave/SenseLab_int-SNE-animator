Black-cube|black box: gallery space that withdraws and technological artwork that obscures its operative relations. Focusing on the luminance of screen and image, most interactive, software-based, and responsive art architecturally and proprioceptively withdraws into a dark void. Evacuating surprise, hilarity, oddity and vagueness, this retreat into the blackened space of screen time, stamps out the fissures that enable art to generate novel spacetimes. Such work and its spaces more often than not instill only ‘the feeling of’ interaction.
