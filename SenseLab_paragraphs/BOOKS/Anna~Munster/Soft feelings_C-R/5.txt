Flume’s sculptural intervention also elicits memories of more distinctly performative gallery bodies. Recall Ulay and Abramovic’s Imponderabilia (1977), in which audiences squeezed through the performers’ nude bodies positioned in the entryway to the gallery. In Flume, confrontation and identity fold, giving way to incipient architecture and inchoate flesh passing across each other’s thresholds: hand to tentacle to orifice. That pause to probe the doorway’s mawing protrusions creates a rhythmic contrast with that ductile pulse of the infrasonic ultra-violet dome; intensities pull away and toward each vibratory field.  An ecology of human and more-than human rhythms emerges, redistributing affects through passageways – movements of bodies, air, data dispersing throughout the space.
