In Andrew Godman’s Flume, space rearranges itself and you/me. Sometimes the space takes off, and, like the space station in Andrei Tarkovsky’s 1972 film Solaris, a quantum time – extraneous to the present time of actual human bodies in the gallery – takes hold. Here the soft sculpture, luminous glow, and whispers compose unworldly durations in which past, present, and potentially forming data entities co-exist: ‘‘an entity composes or creates itself by feeling the other entities that have influenced and informed it; and it feels them as being spatially and temporally distinct from itself.’ (Shaviro, 2012: 60) The passageways of Flume channel and gather these feeling, grasping entities, making felt the compositional modes through which data might become affective. Such modes cannot be immediately perceived by (human) bodies, for we inhabit and generate different occasions of experience. The problem with much contemporary software-based art is that it resorts to forms of presentation – such as visualization and sonification – that attempt to translate ‘data’ for our presentational experience. Instead, Flume enables an ingression of data into the space of art. It enables an experience of ‘soft’ feelings that cannot be recognized by us and yet are nonetheless felt.
