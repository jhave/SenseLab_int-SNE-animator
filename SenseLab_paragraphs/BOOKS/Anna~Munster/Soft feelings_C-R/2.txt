What if a different kind of ‘soft’ art crawled the walls, doors and corridors of gallery spaces instead? Intensive transfers of data, pulsing horizontally and vertically in passageways; algorithmic moods whispering operations to each other; the tonalities of light, sound, touch computationally and corporeally differentiating. You have entered Flume. Or, has it entered you? In this pliant, alien landscape where tentacles multiply across a threshold or where an enigmatic glowing room entices without reason, there is no ‘you’ – the predetermined participant armed with an imperative to engage –anymore. Rather, an inorganic vitality pulses through bodies and software in waves and particles, sweeping matter up in to pulsing, soft ‘feelings’.
