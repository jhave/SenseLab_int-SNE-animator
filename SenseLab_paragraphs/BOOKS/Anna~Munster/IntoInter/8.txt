This rhythm then allowed us to begin to work with other techniques for thinking-making collectively. Reading one particularly difficult philosophical text – Felix Guattari’s Schizoanalytic Cartographies – we decided that the only way to comprehend the enigmatic diagrams of the author was to shift from discussing to drawing them. How to draw them collectively when we were dispersed? We developed a process where one person began a diagrammatic riff upon one of Guattari’s drawings and would then electronically pass the emergent image on to another member of the group. The technique that enabled this was not one that simply duplicated a Surrealist exquisite Corpse protocol (all the while being aware of the history of such rich techniques within aesthetic practices), lay with the deeply felt and immediated work that had emerged for the past year of meetings within the Skype platform and the cultivation of listening processes. The group had already lived through and invented a milieu for itself. Importantly, the technical element in this milieu had played a role but not because it functioned as ‘interface’. Instead, its role was to produce a betweeness that was a dynamic force for the group, allowing it to generate different modes of thinking and working together.
