Lastly, I want to touch upon some recent experiments with media and rhythm with which I, and a group of 80 or so people, have been involved for the past two years.3  The concept of ‘immediation’ is yet to be invented and is part of the work set out for us. But the premise for the project is that all “media” stage and distribute real, embodied, that is, immediate, events. This capacity to enact in the immediacy of everyday life is an integral part of contemporary media’s definition.  A major question propelling the project, if creating volatility and frustration as well, is: how do we sustain immediations across the group itself – a group that sometimes locally ebbs to small groups and at other times globally swells to 100 people operating across three to four time zones and multiple environs. We use a online hub environment for text communication, file depositories and date and time information but many of us are engaged in this project because we want to work immediately with others, to engage and experience lived relations of making and thinking together that are passionate, that can be improvised and that are not necessarily ‘outcome’ focused. We want to talk, read, propose, experiment and proffer different modes of generating and valuing what counts as knowledge.
