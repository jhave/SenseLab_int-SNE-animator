It is a ‘research-creation’ project funded by the Canadian SSHRC for 7 years up until 2019. The project is lead by Erin Manning. It has two main aims: to investigate the concept of ‘immediation’ through the processes, production and valuing of the kinds of knowledge that are immanent to rigorous artistic practice; and to support the transfer of such knowledge through funding research training (of postgraduate and postdoctoral fellows) and collaborating with community partners.
