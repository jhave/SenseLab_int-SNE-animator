What had value for us in this mode of collaborating was not the actual ‘drawings’ per se but rather the process of passing, or what we called ‘gifting’ one diagram to another in the group. You would wake up in the morning and there would be a link in your inbox to a whole new video that someone had made with your material. The point was not simply to remix but rather to transform in order to think through the text of another – Guattari – and in transforming the diagram and gifting it on to another in the group, to generate a rhythm for thought. This rhythm came from translocally co-habiting an ecology of humans, technical elements and aesthetic practices. This in-the-middle is an intermezzo where things really get going; where things do not begin so much as move via what Deleuze and Guattari call: “intercalary events: ‘densifications, intensifications, reinforcements, injections, showerings,…” (Deleuze and Guattari, 2005: 328).  This is a kind of rhythm that cannot be heard without the technique of attunment but it can mmediately be felt. It is a rhythm of relation. And with such rhythms, the ‘inter’ gains a whole new set of potentials as it reterritorrialises and takes off from betweeness.
