Another task of each affinity group was to develop, in the months leading  up to the event, a key concept to help trigger and orient Generating the Impossibleâ€™s self-organizing. The  concepts were  drawn from readings proposed to the whole group by individual SenseLab network participants. The readings were  discussed in regularly scheduled collective brainstorming sessions on Skype. These whole-group sessions fed into and out of discussions taking place on affinity-group-specific writeboards on the grouphub. Each  affinity group approached the preparatory concept work differently. Some immediately threw themselves into meal planning, developing their concepts and evolving group process around that activity. Others focused directly on the transductive question of how to develop a distributive creative process across sites. Others organized weekly Skype  reading groups branching off  from the main reading-focused sessions. In  the end, key concepts explored by affinity groups included tending, attention/attending, exaptation, emergence/emerging, and mapping/choreographing. All of the concepts were  developed with a view  to setting in motion the collective organization that would creatively enable the shift from the forest to the city.
