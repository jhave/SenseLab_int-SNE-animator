Each  party to the conversation will  have thought and felt  differently. Each  will continue afterward to feel,  again very  differently, the tendential force of the prearticulations that came to the “tip of the tongue” but then were  swallowed back down by  the churning momentum of  the event. What was said-gestured, and gestured-unsaid, will modulate the ongoing relation. It will have implanted or inflected tendencies. Accordingly, it will have a co-causal influence on the forms and contents of the participants’ future intercourse together—and even perhaps apart. How many times do we  “rehearse” or  “rehash” with one person a conversation we  had with another? How many times has  a prearticulated tuning toward language (a not-yet of words) popped up later as a fully fledged comment we are certain would have clinched the argument, causing an obsessive replay of the conversation in our heads? Each  subsequent conversation will relationally fold the thisness of conversing into its open field of emergence. A conversation never stands on its own, separate from its capacity to rejig  the field of attunement. It has  already spread like ripples on a fluid social surface.
