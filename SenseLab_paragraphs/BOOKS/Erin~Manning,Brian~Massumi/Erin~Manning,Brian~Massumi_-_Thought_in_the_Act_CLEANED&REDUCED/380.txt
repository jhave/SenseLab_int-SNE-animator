The  improvised composition of co-gesturing enters into a pattern visà-vis  the flow  of  words. An  even more complex emergence of  resonant emphasis and contrapuntal  divergence arises between the gestures and the words. Together, they make felt  a speaking-with that moves the conversation. The  words on either side  of the conversation co-speak, just as the hands, face,  arms, and torso co-gesture. They play off each other, in alternation, sharing the heat of  the moment. They overlay and cross, attuning both parties to the conversation’s continually passing present. Even moments of  confusion or  discord are  attunements, in that they intensely re-cue the participants to what is happening. The  play of words has  its own improvised rhythm that is neither separable from the accompanying rhythm of the gestures nor reducible to it.  Double articulation: words and gestures differently coming together. This  doubly articulated flow  is punctuated by felt  prearticulations of an interruptive kind: beginnings of  interjections cut  off  in the name of  politeness, audibly performative but meaningless grunts and squeaks. The  bodily gestures are most intense at precisely those moments. A backgrounding, foregrounding dance of  prearticulation, moving between gesture and words, makes the force of the conversation felt  beyond its  semantic formulation.40  The  conversation is less a back-and-forth between two separate bodies than a single relational flow  occurring in complex relation. Words  and  gesture,  tone and rhythm, fold generatively back into one another, returning to the quasi-chaos of tending-toward-meaning from which this conversation— and all language—comes. The  overall effect is a coming-differentlytogether-again-into-language in a shared event of speech that was integrally co-composed.
