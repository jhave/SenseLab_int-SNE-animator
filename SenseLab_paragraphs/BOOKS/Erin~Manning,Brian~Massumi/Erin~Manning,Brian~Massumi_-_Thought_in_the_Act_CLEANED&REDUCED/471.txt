Many other propositions were  generated on site  from affinity-group activities. Some took an installation form; others were  processual unfoldings  exploring “diagrammatic” relations. Projects spawned other projects, including a sound and image performance for/on the lake that saw itself as a prolongation of The Mi(d)st  by other means. One affinity group made it their task to “tend” the process in its globality, insinuating themselves into other affinity groups’ interactions in subtle ways  intended to help leaven their creative initiatives, perhaps without the beneficiaries of this processual intercession even being aware of it. Unfortunately, the space is lacking here to go into the full richness of these explorations.
