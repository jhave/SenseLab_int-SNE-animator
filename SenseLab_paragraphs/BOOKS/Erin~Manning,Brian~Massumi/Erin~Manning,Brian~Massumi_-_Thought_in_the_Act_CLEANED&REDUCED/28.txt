Entrainment in relation to Mukhopadhyay’s flower-field would have immediately placed the flowering within an efficient mode such as “picking” or “smelling.” That Mukhopadhyay’s experience is less of the flower itself than of  the field  of  flowering and shadowing and storying does not suggest that he cannot also  smell the flower or eventually differentiate  it from other affordances. What it suggests is that there is a tendency within autism to immediately perceive the relational quality of a welling environment that dynamically appears in a jointness of experience. This foregrounding of the immediate field of experience we call entertainment.
