“The perception of similarity,” Walter Benjamin writes, “is in every case bound to a flashing up.  It flits past, can possibly be won again, but cannot really be held fast as can other perceptions” (2004, 695). The coinciding of the as-if and the what-if produces a flash of similarity. Just  like this. Similarity at the flashpoint is nonsensuous because it is thought-felt at the anypoint limit of  expression where both movement and language become foreign to their general functioning in “a delirium that carries [them] off, a witch’s line that escapes the dominant system.” Nonsensuous similarity: directly thought-felt in the register of the visionary.
