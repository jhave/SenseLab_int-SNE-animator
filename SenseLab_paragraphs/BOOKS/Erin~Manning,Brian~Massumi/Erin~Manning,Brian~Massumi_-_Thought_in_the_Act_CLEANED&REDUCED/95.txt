What is it,  in a work of dance, that gives  it this capacity to linger, to reactivate itself, contagiously, beyond its own duration? What is it, in the techniques mobilized by  the Forsythe Company, that is capable of agitating language to the limit so that it begins to move, movement reciprocating by taking on the inflections of language?
Here  we take up the refrain again, hoping to restage the contagion in writing.
