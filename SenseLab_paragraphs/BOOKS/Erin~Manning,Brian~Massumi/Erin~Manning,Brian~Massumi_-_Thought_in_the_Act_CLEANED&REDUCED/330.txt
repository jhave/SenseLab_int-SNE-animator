Throughout Housing  the Body, Dressing the Environment, as was the case  in Dancing the  Virtual, we  were  (sometimes painfully) aware that all  explorations at the edge of inquiry risk  failure. Certain platforms for  relation didn’t take off,  or even collapsed, their attractive force failing to find the conditions for relational emergence in the given context. When that happened, either they dissipated entirely or  elements of  the platform combined with another. “Failure,” processually speaking, added a fissional and fusional dimension to the event that was not preplanned. From this point of view, failure was generative, a positive formative factor in the event’s selforganizing. A case in point was a regrouping that occurred on the last day of the “Around Architecture” platform that took a turn toward the outside of  the event.28 The  group improvised procedures to collectively explore the juncture between architecture and urbanism, in this case the SAT building  and its surrounding neighborhood.
