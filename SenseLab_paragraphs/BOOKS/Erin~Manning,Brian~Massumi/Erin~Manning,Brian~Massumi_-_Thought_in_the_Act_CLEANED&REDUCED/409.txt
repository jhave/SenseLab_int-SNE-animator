The aim of  Generating the  Impossible is to catalyze a collective marginalist experiment in artistic activity, flirting with the limit of artâ€™s  relational field, making felt  the threshold that vibrates with it.  What field of relation might be  expected to lie beyond the threshold? For us,  there is only one answer: the political. Generating the  Impossible is an exercise in the potential becoming-political of art,  beyond its limit. To the extent that the approaching of the limit succeeds in enacting a concertedly qualitative economy, one that is self-affirming as a polyrhythmic form of life, the politics foretokened will be effectively anticapitalist.
