A tendency, metamodeled, is an incipient assemblage (a platform for relation).38 The question of an assemblage emerging into occurrent attunement is, as always, a question of technique, as both Deleuze and Guattari and Whitehead emphasize. “The right chaos, and the right vagueness, are jointly required for  any effective harmony” (Whitehead 1978,  112). For Generating the  Impossible, the quasi-chaotic initial conditions for  emergence include not only the specific contents brought by participants, and not only the plurality of generic forms in which they might be exhibited. They also  include the accumulated techniques of relation experimentally assembled in past events. For  Generating the  Impossible, the  presence of past participants will prepopulate the event’s emergence with collectively acquired tendencies vying for the opportunity to metamodel themselves in a new iteration under very  different conditions than in earlier events.
