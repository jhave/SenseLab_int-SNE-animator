A book with Claude Monet’s Water Lily Pond lies open on a wooden bench a meter or so away from Ettinger’s canvas. “A friend,” she  calls  the image. Beside  the Monet, another book with Leonardo da Vinci’s St. John the Baptist  also  lies  open. On  the wall  above—one of  only two, as the space is open to the outside on one end and continuous with the rest of the house on the other—there are four or five earlier paintings, not a consistent number:  they will get taken down, be replaced, repainted even. There are also two easels, sometimes holding multiple paintings, each in progress. And notebooks with their own complex mix of words and images.
