Even one body alone is dancing relationally. Its movement stands out in its difference against the background of all the other dance movements it potentially might have been. Or—why not?—of all the movements of dance history. One body alone is moving to the traces of movement’s own passing, where it just was,  absorbed in tracing where it is going. “Sense motion traces,” Forsythe instructs (2003b, 16). This is what chaining sensations instead of positions is all about. When one, two, multiple bodies are dancing, they are moving in relation to a sea of motion traces enveloped in the any-point. When there is one body alone, its potential makes two. When there are two, it makes three. When there are three, it makes . . . a second one and a second three. . . . The  count gets  vague because movement is always in rolling numerical excess over itself. The “thirdness” of all movement: the sea of motion-traces enveloped in the any-point in relation to which dancing dances.
