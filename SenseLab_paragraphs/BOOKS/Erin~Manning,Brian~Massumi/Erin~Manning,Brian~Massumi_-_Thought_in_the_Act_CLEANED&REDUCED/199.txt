All of a sudden, a lingering. And  so we are  reminded that the suspension is everywhere speciously present, speculatively active at different velocities, notionally in different registers, relationally across every modality of experience. A lingering, a suspension of isolatable movement form, a suspension of language, as designation or narration, and also  a suspension, within movement-moving, of its human characters, tuning to their elemental qualities, gesturing to danceâ€™s capacity to hold dissonant times together in movement.
