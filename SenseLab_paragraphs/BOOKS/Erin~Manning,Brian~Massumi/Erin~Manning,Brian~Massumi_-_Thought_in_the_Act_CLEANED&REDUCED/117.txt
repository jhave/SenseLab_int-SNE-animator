Chaining positions and postures is  how we  experience movement in its  average, everyday functioning.  We  have our routines. The  lunch bell sounds, a  routine sequence of  steps leads us,  largely unthinkingly,  to the cafeteria. Position after position, posture by posture, we proceed to the lunch line. We see a vending machine on the way. Unthinkingly, our hand delves into the pocket and feeds the machine. It’s habitual. The  sensorimotor sequencing follows a logic: if–then. If the bell  has  rung, then . . . it all follows. Recognition, logical consequence.
