2 	Everyone was  required to read the same selection of  philosophical texts in advance of the event. Certain periods of close reading and discussion of the texts would be included among the activities, both in small groups and in plenary session. This was not intended to force agreement on theoretical issues. The role  of the readings was  to give  the entire group a shared set of  conceptual resources that could be  collectively mobilized, or used as pivots around which a recognition of different approaches would revolve. Whether collectively mobilizing or differentiating, what was  important was  that everyone be  on the same page. To be avoided at all costs were general ideas and preassumed positionings. All conceptual commentary would have to create an effective link-in of some kind to the texts.
