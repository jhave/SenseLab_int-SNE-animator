“Synching is not what’s important, in the sense of matching already known timing,” Forsythe explains (2011, Nov. 8). What’s important to the what-if of cueing and aligning is how position itself becomes movement. “Go  slower, be in the other’s past (right before they catch up to you), then move past them to their future—look for  the moment—aim at it rather than going directly to it [. . .] then shift” (Forsythe 2011, Nov. 8). Time-shift. You don’t always move at extreme speed, you vary the rhythm. Remember the rhythmic milieu.
