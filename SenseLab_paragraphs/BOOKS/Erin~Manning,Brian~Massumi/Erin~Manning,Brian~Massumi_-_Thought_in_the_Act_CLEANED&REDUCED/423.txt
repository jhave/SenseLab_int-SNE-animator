If forgetting is the condition of giving, the gift is the sign of the impossible. As such, it cannot be thought in time. It evades the linear time-structure of  capitalist economics: the arrow of  value-adding and accumulation. Instead, it invents a time of  the not-yet that will  have been, a futureanterior in and of  the relational field  of  giving. Capitalism, as  Joseph Schumpeter famously stated, is also  about excess and “creative destruction.” But  it practices forgetting as a kind of inertia. It forgets to actively forget, in order always to return to exchange in a way that ostensibly makes it all about the object again. The capitalist economy continually translates excess  relational activity into objective surplus.  It  stockpiles objects and instruments of exchange (material and immaterial) for eventual turnover, as part of its market pricing mechanisms and investment cycles. In order to do this, it is forever requantifying: translating the qualities of life associated with objects of exchange as found in their emergent field  of relation into quantitative measures.
