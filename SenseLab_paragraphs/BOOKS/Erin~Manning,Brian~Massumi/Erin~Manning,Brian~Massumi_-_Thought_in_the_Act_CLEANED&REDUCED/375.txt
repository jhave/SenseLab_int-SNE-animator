Metamodelings of generative process are deterritorializing. They move tendentially across institutionalizations and morph them. If the metamodeling is to avoid becoming a model—a prescriptive template—Generating the Impossible will have to embrace its own perishing, attuned not to dissolving  content but to the reactivatable traces of the experiment’s tendential passing. An event of metamodeling must be self-expiring. It must creatively find ways to affirm its generative power in its passing. The emergent attunement cannot be allowed to settle into a simple harmony, where “harmony” is understood as a diversity of parts subordinated to a unified functioning. We propose an event that is not self-institutionalizing. For these reasons, a mechanism for the perishing of Generating the Impossible will be built into it as  an enabling constraint. The  technique of  relation embodying this enabling constraint is called the “free  radical.”
