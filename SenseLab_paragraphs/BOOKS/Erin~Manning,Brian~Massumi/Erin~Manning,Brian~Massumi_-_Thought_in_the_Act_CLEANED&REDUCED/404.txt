Take  Deleuze and Guattari’s example of the alcoholic. In  the process of drinking, each drink exchanged by the alcoholic for money is, to some extent, the potential “last” drink. If the potential “lastness”—the limitidea—is not negotiated, the drinking process, and the forms of pleasures, pains, and social interactions associated with it,  will  not be  sustainable. For the process to continue, the last  drink must be not the last  but a nextto-the-last—one glass before the end. The  last  glass will take the alcoholic over the edge into a new relational field  harboring other relational qualities.  If the penultimate is passed and the limit reached, the alcoholic will cross  the threshold from intoxication to,  for example, alcohol poisoning. The  threshold will  have been passed from form-of-life to life-threatening breakdown. New relational fields then await: the hospital, Alcoholics Anonymous, possibly the cemetery. What “last” means must be continuously recalibrated. The  limit will be relative to any number of factors: the speed of the drinking, the level  of fatigue, the level  of stress, and the quality of the company. The  intuitive evaluation of the limit will immanently modulate the relational field of alcoholic experience. If the limit is not reached, the drinking will  rebegin, following its own rhythm of intoxication and sobering up.  If the threshold is crossed, the result might be disastrous—or healing. The  necessary rebeginning might be a move toward a restorative abstinence. Now life itself will have to function as its own power of intoxication, undoubtedly altering the field  of relation and form of life.
