Nonsensuous perception comes together with sensuous perception at all stages of Woolf Phrase. We sit and watch the work in its unfolding, alive to the minute changes in tempo, the rise  and fall  of voice, the undulating  of  the wall  of  sound. We  also  perceive, nonsensuously, the edgings into co-composition of rhythm-becoming-language, of rhythm-becomingmovement. The  paradox of disjunctive synthesis makes itself felt  at each stage of the commotion: language and movement are not one, and yet,  at their limit, they flash up in a oneness of similarity. As-if.
