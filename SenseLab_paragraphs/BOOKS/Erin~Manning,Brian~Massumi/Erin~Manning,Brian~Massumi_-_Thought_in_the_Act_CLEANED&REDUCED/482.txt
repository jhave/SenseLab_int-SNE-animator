Another of  the Montreal propositions that stood out also  produced unintended effects of a more convivial kind. One affinity group decided to meet downtown at a local bus stop and ride  the bus down its whole line while reading aloud A Userâ€™s Guide to (Demanding) the Impossible, one of the books featured in our preparatory concept work for Generating the Impossible (available freely online). Affinity-group participants boarded the bus  early on a Sunday morning at the first stop on its line and sat at the back. Passing  the book from one person to another, they staged a mobile recitation and reading group. They had not known what to expect in terms of public reaction. At one point, an earphoned teenager boarded the bus  and sat, at first  unawares, among the readers. When it came time for the book to be passed, it fell to him. Despite the surprise, he took off his  earphones and joined in. He was the first of many. The  bus  driver also  became intrigued, becoming so engaged in the action that, after reaching the end of the line, he drove the bus off its route to drop the Impossiblers off at the vacant lot where we were  all meeting at the end of the day  for a final urban potluck.
