In  Mukhopadhyay’s case  it is that  the pen’s call—“Here I am!  Here I am!”—remains interwoven with Jack’s  laughter rather than distinctly taking the fore. “And within the same moment,” Mukhopadhyay continues, “there may be  a sudden sound of laughter that can dissolve the stories told by the reflections and the sullen silence of the chair’s shadow with its  demanding noise, making you wonder which part of the funny story from Jack’s voice you missed listening to while you were  watching the giant blades of the fan  pushing out every story and sound away from it with air”  (2008, 53). Instead of immediately tuning to what Whitehead calls  cognition’s “small focal region of clear illumination,” the event here gives  equal billing to the field of the cognizable, what for the fully formed cognition will  remain a “large penumbral  region of  experience which tells  of  intense experience in dim apprehension”—flickeringly reminding  us that that apparent “simplicity of clear consciousness is no measure of the complexity of complete experience” (1978, 267). In the moment, “in” the pen might just was well have been “in” the blades, or “in” the laughter. It all depends on how the commotion cognitively shakes down in the end. Even at the cognitive end of the experience, the “large penumbral region” of experience still  flickers with what might just as well  have been. It is the remaining refuge of experience’s variety.
