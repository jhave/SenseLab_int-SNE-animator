For example, there is a formal economy of academic activity in which value is assessed in terms of number of peer-reviewed research results. The greater the countable research outcomes, the more able  a researcher is to continue to produce: his  or her record can be used to justify better working conditions and access to research-project funding. Parallel to this, there is an academic star  system. It functions as an informal economy bestowing  intellectual prestige-value on select individuals. The  formal and informal academic economies are  most often mutually reinforcing. Both tie into the monetary economy, in the form of increased earning power on the academic job  market. In  the art  arena, there is a similar conjunction between a formal economy (based on the number of jury-assessed shows and prizes and the number of solo  versus group shows) and an art-world star system informally distributing prestige-value. Traditionally, the tie-in of the art world to the monetary economy is through the commodity market for art objects. With research-creation and other ways  of professionalizing artistic activity in the university system, the tie-in extends to a hybrid artâ€“ academic job  market as well.
