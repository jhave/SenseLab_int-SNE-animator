“Something starts to happen” (Ettinger 2010). The contours of the faces and figures disappear into the rhythm, then reappear, as if by  accident. And  drift. The  faces  and figures may well  shift position. Their contours may morph. Facial  elements may invade the figure, as in Autistwork No. 1, where an arm and shoulder sprout the appearance of an eye. It is less that the faces  and figures are painted than that they reemerge, of themselves, from the painting process.
