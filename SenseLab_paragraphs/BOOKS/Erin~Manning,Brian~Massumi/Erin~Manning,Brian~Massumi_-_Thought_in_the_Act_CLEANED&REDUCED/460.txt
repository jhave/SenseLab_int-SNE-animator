A second level  of  organization was  set  up to cut  across the affinitygroup structure. Each participant was placed in a living situation at Mekoos (a cabin) mixing members from different affinity groups. This  was  done to create a framework for  informal sharing of affinity-group-based experiences and exploration. It  was  also  intended to counter any tendency for  the affinity groups to develop into in-groups identifying themselves against the group as  a whole. The  hope was  that this system of  crosssolidarities would not only facilitate concept and technique contagion, but would also produce crossovers between groups that would create the conditions for emergent constellations preventing the organizational structure from ossifying into rigid segmentations.
