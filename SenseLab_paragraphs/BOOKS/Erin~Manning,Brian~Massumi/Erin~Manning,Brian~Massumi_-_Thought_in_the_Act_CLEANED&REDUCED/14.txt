What is it we really mean, when we say “human”? According to autism activist Amanda Baggs,  we  certainly don’t mean “autistic” (2010c). We mean “neurotypical,” we mean expressing oneself predominantly in spoken language, and most of  all,  we  mean being immediately focused on humans to the detriment of other elements in the environment.2 “Most people attend to human voices above all else”  (Krumins).
