Forsythe defines counterpoint as “a field  of action in which the intermittent and irregular coincidence of  attributes between organizational elements produces an ordered interplay.” Counterpoint of  movement and language in Woolf Phrase is best understood as a coinciding of both at their limit, in the relational any-point of the motional and the notional. Here, the what-if of  movement and the as-if  of  language co-compose. Together they unsettle the linearity of time in the tense of the if–then. In the speaking and in the moving, working in disjunctive synthesis, two speculative time signatures interrupt one another. What-if asks the dancer to “anticipate the other dancer’s future.” In  this movement proposition, the dancer is being asked to shift time, to make time in the tense of the future-felt. As-if asks the reader to place in an uneasy holding pattern more than this one image, more than this one narrative line.
