The constraint of “activation” was generalized as a rule against description or  reportage, in keeping with the principle that a generative encounter could not be grounded prioritarily in content. We were concerned to create techniques that were capable of intensifying the passage between different modalities of experimentation, and specifically between smalland largegroup processes. The  question was how to generate a process for passingbetween that did  not deintensify what came before. The  commonly used technique of summary “reporting” to “explain” what happened in a small group to the larger group tends to do little more than break the movement between and dampen co-causal synergies. The  performative was  chosen in this context as well,  as a transitional mechanism. What happened in a small-group session had to be  activated in capsule form for  the group as a whole. If language were  used for this, it had to be language that was not simply descriptive or denotative, but conveyed a performative force. A concept-working group, for  example, might decide to reperform a discussion of a philosophical problem in the form of a movement exercise. We  were  continually asking ourselves how to create modalities of transition that captured not the content of the last exercise (be it artistic or philosophical) but its  affective intensity (its  generative force). The  challenge was to recreate tonalities of experience across modalities—to make felt the intensity of thought in practice.
