When the notional meets the motional, it’s not that we no longer understand the words. It’s not even that we don’t ally  the words to the movement. It’s that the words, in the mode of the as-if, contort to the movement they activate. It’s that language, when in counterpoint with movement at the limit, tweaks into a rhythm with movement. At this any-point, language, like movement, proposes itself as “an organ for listening.” We hear it sounding, its  counterpoint with movement creating a joint rhythmic milieu. While we can differentiate the words from Willems’s acoustic environment, while we  know what is language and what is movement and what is sound—Paaf!—we are no longer certain where expression begins and ends. Notionally, we  have “no idea.” Knowing and unknowing cocompose, dancing thought around.
