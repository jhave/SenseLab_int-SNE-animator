What happens in the middle is that the either–or is held fast together in passing contrast. It is the holding together that is felt, in excess of one or the other. The in-excess of the one or the other is not a both–and. The either–or is taken as such into the passing. The differential is sustained. This is what Deleuze and Félix Guattari term a “disjunctive synthesis” (1983, 12–13).
