Accordingly, on day  five, SenseLab founder and pivot person Erin  Manning rather abruptly announced that the SenseLab was no more. The  declaration of its passing was a performative  proposition posing a series  of unsaid questions to the collective. Shall we as a group resuscitate the SenseLab? If so, with what continuities and what transformations? Is the energy and momentum there to justify its continuance on processual grounds? Do we proceed from here? Have we done our work, or is there still  work to do?  Or: have we done our work so well  that we risk  becoming the institution we never wanted? How do  we proceed from here? Reinvent or perish.
