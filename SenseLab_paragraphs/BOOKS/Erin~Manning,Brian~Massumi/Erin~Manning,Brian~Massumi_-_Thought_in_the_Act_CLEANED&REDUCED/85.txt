Whatsoever activity, bare activity: “A perspective of the universe.” Prehension as a fielding of the milieu in its unfolding, resolving into an occasion, the occasion conditioned by an affording for or a being taken account of.  A perspective of the universe is a lure. “The world always gets  in our way as still  more world” (AG 2002, xii). An alluring moreness. Emergence in the milieu of the between, an architectural surround is a conjoint transformation, a relational dynamic. “Her fielding of her surroundings never ceases, continuing even in sleep” (AG 2002, 7). A dance of attention of the bare activity of becomings coalescing into a coming event. Preoperation in an “underlying activity of realization individualizing itself” (Whitehead
1967b, 70). Organism that persons not as a human body so much as a push that pulls across matters of fact. “Each instant is only a way  of grouping matters of  fact” (Whitehead 1968,  146).  Each  instant, a landing site  for a taking place. Each  taking place a prehensive interlocking of reciprocal modes. Matter of fact:  the thisness of takings place, the thisness of architecting that world.
