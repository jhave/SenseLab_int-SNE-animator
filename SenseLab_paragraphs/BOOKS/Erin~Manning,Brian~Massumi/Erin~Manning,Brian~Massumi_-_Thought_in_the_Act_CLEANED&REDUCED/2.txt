This  book runs interference. Its goal  is to open philosophy to its outside, to challenge philosophy to compose with concepts already on their way in another mode, in the mode of artistic practice, in the mode of eventformation, of  activism, of  dance, even of  everyday perception. It  writes into this difference, composing across the breach between philosophy and art,  philosophy and dance, writing and painting, speaking and moving.
