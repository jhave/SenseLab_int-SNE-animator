Preoperation, a preacceleration agitating in potentia. Preoperation, how the many become one. “Perceptual landing sites  occur always in sets—a flock  of  birds flying in formation” (AG  2002, 10).  To  land perceptually is to field-with in agitation, it is to become-body in a preoperation that subtracts for a tending that apportions out. Organisms-that-person agitate in the mix, but always in a withness of environment: a becoming ecology of practices.
