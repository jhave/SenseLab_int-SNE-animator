Attention flags. Bodies fatigue. Stomachs growl. It is remarkable the extent to which the conventional genres of artistic and academic encounter disregard these basic facts. It was important to us to attend to these constraints and build them into each event through a commitment to managing this most prosaic “biopolitical” dimension of the encounter, in as hospitable a manner as possible. Food was plentiful and presented in way that called forth the rituals of conviviality surrounding shared eating in noninstitutional settings. (Food as a technique of relation would become a motif for subsequent events.) Dancing the Virtual started a tradition that carried over into all our events: a napping affordance. A sleeping tent, with mattresses and pillows for  a floor, was  set  up in a corner of the space as a place for jet-lagged participants to regenerate, or as a quiet refuge for those feeling overwhelmed or socially challenged by the event’s intensity. The  sleeping tent created an internal threshold to the event’s outside. Participants could manage their own rhythm of withdrawal and reentry to the proceedings without entirely absenting themselves.
