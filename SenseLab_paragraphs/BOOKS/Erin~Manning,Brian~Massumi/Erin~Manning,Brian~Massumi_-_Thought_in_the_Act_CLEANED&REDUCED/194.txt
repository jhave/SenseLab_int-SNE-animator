Somehow, a likeness. Somehow, as if two times, two events, this and its likeness, could linger in cohabitation, as-if. Just like that, the flashpoint of nonsensuous similarity, the cut  into likeness that brings timeâ€™s overflow into the moment, this moment. But what a strange moment, this specious present, a moment qualified not by its being-present but by its spread, by the span of time it includes, the past and future rolling into it. A visionary moment, a futurity in the making.
