Forsythe Company dancer Dana Caspersen explains: “I experience two kinds of vision at once. The  space around [is] alive with potential, invisible forms, and lines of movement. I am continually ambushed, caught up, in this welter of doubled vision” (2011, 97). This  superposition of actively engaging with the just-now—just like  that—of the complexity of  the present presenting itself, is superposed with the futurity of how the whatwill-come has  already left its trace on the movement-welling.
