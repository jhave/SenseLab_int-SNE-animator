A mode of existence never preexists an event. The sittability of the chair in your office  does not preclude the chair becoming an affordance for sleep. The  mode of existence has  to do with the emergent quality of the experience, not with the factually cross-checked identity of the objects featuring in it. What is startling about the neurotypical is the capacity to background the in-formation of the field, and to pre-subtract from the expressive potential  of its relational complexity. No cartwheels in the classroom.
