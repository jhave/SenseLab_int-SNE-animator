Each  molecule was  invited to choose an emissary as well  as to name a host. The  emissary of each local grouping was  paired with the host of another group. Sometime in the five months preceding the main event, the emissary would travel to the host group (virtual voyages were  a possibility where resources did  not allow physical travel). The  time and mode of their arrival would be unannounced: the arrival of the guest had an element of the unexpected. The  role  of the emissary was to make “first contact” with the other local culture. To facilitate the meeting, “movement profiles” were  compiled by  the SenseLab and distributed  to the emissaries. The  movement profiles described the designated host’s habitual daily movements through the city so that if the emissary so desired, first contact could be made in a performative fashion, taking advantage of the element of  surprise.33   Emissaries were  encouraged to use  physical address information and standard forms of communication like  cell  phones sparsely, focusing instead on “encountering” the host, guided by the profile. Upon meeting, the host’s job was to gather the local molecule together and treat the emissary to a “relational soup.”
