The  seed  for  Generating the Impossible was  planted. This  final event of the series  would take place in July 2011, during the rollout of a new phase of the SAT’s existence marked by the opening of a complete building renovation, including the addition of  a third story topped by  a large-scale interactive, immersive media environment in the shape of a dome (the “SATosphere”). The  SAT planned to use the architectural rebuilding as an occasion for renewing its experimentation as an art  institution, including a rethinking of the modalities of exhibition and kinds of creative events such an institution  affords. (Please refer  to the final chapter, “Postscript to Generating the  Impossible,” for  a brief account of  how the event actually  transpired. This  chapter, under its original title, “Propositions for  an Exploded Gallery: Generating the Impossible,” was  originally written to share with other collectives as a contribution toward what we imagined might become a “process seed bank.” Once it began to take monstrous form [we had originally anticipated writing a short five-page piece!], we realized that extending our practice into a written document on techniques that have emerged over the past ten years would also  allow us to take stock of where we had come to as a group and to collectively reorient toward the next event. Accordingly, it was written in the future tense. We have retained the original wording here.)
