Entertainment is prior to the distinction between active and passive, subject  and object. Entertainment is captivation in a dance of attention. All experiential fielding includes incipient entrainments and immediate entertainments. It is a question of degree, and of mixture. The  call  to smell a flower upon seeing it—the welling sense that a flower is for something, for smelling—is a neurotypical response that is already moving toward grasping the flower as an object against the environment as a background, even as the environment is just coming to entertainment. For the neurotypical, the mode of entertainment tends already to be saturated with entrainment. The field of  experience is pre-perfused with for-ness. It  is already tending toward expression in use-value—rather than entertaining expressibility on its own account. For the autistic, the flower and the environment, entrainment and entertainment, are  not immediately separable. Flower and environment are  not reciprocally delimited as foreground and background, separable object and surround, but feature jointly in co-activity. They co-feature as tonal differences in a field  modulating the whole of experience at all levels, composing an overall mode of existence that is in a different key than the neurotypical norm.
