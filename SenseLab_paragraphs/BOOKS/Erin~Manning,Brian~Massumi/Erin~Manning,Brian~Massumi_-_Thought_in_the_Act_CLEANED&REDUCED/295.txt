Given the research-creation context in which we were working, it would prove crucial to avoid not only the communication model but also  any paradigm of  “application,” whether it be  practical results from existing research and design disciplines as applied by artists to their work in their own field, or  conceptual frameworks as applied to art  or  technology by philosophers or  other theoreticians. Concept-work could not adopt an external posture of description or  explanation. It would have to be  activated collaboratively on site,  entering the relational fray  as one creative factor among others. The  term “research-creation” was  retained as a key term for an exploratory openness in this activity of producing new modes of thought and action. How to resituate the hyphen of research-creation to locate it as much within philosophical inquiry as artistic practice and between them both and other fields?
