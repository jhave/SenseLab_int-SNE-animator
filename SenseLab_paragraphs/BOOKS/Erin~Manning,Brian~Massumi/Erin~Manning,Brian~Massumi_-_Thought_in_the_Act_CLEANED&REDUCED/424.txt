As discussed earlier, research-creation participates in both the gift altereconomy and the dominant quantitative economy. The  art  market is no different than any other. It  translates the excess relational activity of  research-creation into object-oriented surplus, even finding ways  to stockpile and quantitatively value “ephemeral art.” The  prevalence of the concern for  new modes of documentation and archiving is a sign  of the art-economic times. Prestige-value, for its part, is ever  renascent. The  collective evaluation at the limit in the model of the gift  economy is backgrounded, and the vicissitudes of the market itself, its arrow of measurable value adding, are foregrounded.
