The  friend is an uncanny presence. Non-I, more-than human: the friend is always a new species, created for  just this or  that processual occasion. The  field  of creation is not populated by  subjects predefined. The  event of  the work’s contiguities, the event of  the work’s excess of  form or figure—this is the subject. Today, the subject may take the form of a line, a line that is never quite straight, never quite horizontal, that stretches across this and that canvas, that moves with an outside that propels it, tuning to light. Tomorrow, the subject may come of an aria  that activates a new mobility in the line. The subject evolves, and with it a dynamic perceptual field. This  field  is replete with relational tendencies, thoughts in the feeling. It is replete with itself.
