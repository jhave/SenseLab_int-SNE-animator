Autistic perception dances attention,  affirming the interconnectedness of  modes of  existence, foregrounding the relationality at the heart of perception, emphasizing how experience unfolds through the matrix of  qualitative fields  of  overlap and emphasis already immediately moving  toward expression in a  dynamic field  of  becoming alive with cocomposition. For autistics, language comes late, and it is this that perhaps marks most starkly their difference from neurotypicals. Neurotypical experience tends immediately to align to the beyond of the milieu of relation, to an ulterior phase in which the flower stands alone, a solitary object separate from its shadow-stories. The separating out of the object backgrounds the intrinsic relationality of the field’s  coming to expression, clearing the stage for an overshadowing human subject to cast his presence in its place, in order to take personal credit for  the field’s  environmentally emergent accounting for itself.
