Food preparation has  been an important part of all  SenseLab events. For Generating the Impossible, it played an even more central role because of the convivial way it cut transversally across the levels of organization, both cabin based and affinity-group based. This transversality occurred because, practically, each evening meal had to be prepared in a given cabin. This meant that each participant would spend significant amounts of time as a guest in another cabin, and would host others in their home cabin. This created a bridge of hospitality between the cabin and the affinity-group structures. Food preparation was  complex (think only of taking allergies and other food requirements of fifty-four people into account). Each  meal comprised at least three courses, and affinity groups invested their creative energies into making them artful and generative for the event as a whole. Meals took at least a few hours to prepare (a full day for one affinity group!). This meant that people would be moving in and out of activities of different kinds, threading the food preparation into an active weave of the day. In the care and effort taken to feed the group, an event-wide hospitality could be felt  that suffused each aspect of the everyday. Hospitality, practiced in this way,  produces an ethos of care, for the event, in the event. Pounds of couscous, spaghetti squash, mangoes, and Persian rice  were  added to the arsenal of concepts, as food preparation became an avenue for experiences to be shared, ideas to be explored, and concepts to be artistically staged. Eventfully deployed, food sharing can foster emergent forms of sociality constituting qualitative alter-economies of differentially shared experience. We were  fortunate that among our participating artists was one with experience as a chef. Andrew Goodman was invaluable in the intensive role  of food consultant and meal-planning facilitator.
