You’re  late, you’re hurrying from the subway to the office  on a crowded rush-hour  sidewalk. Bodies all  around, thicker and thinner, faster and slower, in a complex ebb  and flow.  In the ebb  and flow,  temporary openings  come and go. Your perception is focused on the coming and going of the openings, which correspond to no thing  in particular. Each  opening is a field  effect. It is an artifact of the moving configuration of the bodies around you, factoring in their relative speeds, and their rates of acceleration and deceleration as their paths weave around each other and around obstacles. The  opening is not simply a hole, a lack  of something occupying  it.  It is a positive expression of how everything in the field, moving and still, integrally relates at that instant. It is the appearance of the field’s relationality, from a particular angle. The  particular angle is that of your body getting ahead. The opening is how the field appears as an affordance for your getting-ahead. Your  movement has  to be present to the opening as it happens. Wait, and the opening closes. Its perception and your moving into it must be one. There is no time to reflect, no time to focus, assess, and choose. If you focus on one body over another, you see one body then another—and not the opening in the field  of movement they share. You have to soften your focus, letting the field’s changing configuration dilate to fill experience. You have to let what is normally your peripheral vision take over, attending to everything in the “same way.”
