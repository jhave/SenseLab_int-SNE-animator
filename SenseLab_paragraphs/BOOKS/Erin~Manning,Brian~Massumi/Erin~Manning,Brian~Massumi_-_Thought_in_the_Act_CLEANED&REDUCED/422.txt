as  simply the destruction of  actual objects. While it is certainly also  a destruction of  wealth, the potlatch ritual is even more so  an active forgetting of  the wealth itself through a foregrounding of  the event-time of giving. Forgetting activates the field  of relation in such a way  that the emphasis is based no longer on the subject–object encounter (and all the forms of ressentiment this calls  forth) but on the ways  in which this singularity of expression activates a new kind of collective futurity. Forgetting, as Maurice Blanchot emphasizes, “ushers in a thought, a future, a community without any guarantees.” This  ushering is the giving itself— not a gift of the past, but a gift for the future—“a leap into the unknown” (Ramadanovic 2001). In Generating the Impossible, the usher of destruction and forgetting will be the free radical.
