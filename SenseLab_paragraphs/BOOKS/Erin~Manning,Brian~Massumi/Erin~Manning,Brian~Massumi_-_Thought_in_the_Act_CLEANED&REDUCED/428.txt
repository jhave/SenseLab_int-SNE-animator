As long as the limit is not reached, it plays a positive role  as a creative factor in the process at whose margin it lies. Emergent attunement depends on the invention of  conditions to create directly qualitative relational limits. These immanent limits are  not unlike the “terminus” in William James’s sense (the concept that figured so prominently in Dancing the Virtual).  Immanent limits only function if they actively invent modalities of forgetting.
