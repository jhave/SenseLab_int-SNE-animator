The  notion of  “emergent attunement” as  we  propose to practice it is adapted from the work of Daniel Stern (1985,  138–45). Relational attunement as Stern conceives it is more a polyrhythm than a harmony. In  a harmonic musical chord, the singularity of the notes is subsumed into the global effect of  their coming-together. Their diversity disappears into the unity of that effect, and into its structural function in the larger organization of the piece. An attunement in Stern’s sense does not subsume the singularity of the contributing actions that come into relation, even as it brings them together to joint effect.
