The  outside brings friends. They are carefully positioned in Ettinger’s studio, choreographed in a fielding intensively open to them. They populate. They participate. They provoke. But they are not influences in any direct sense, or  even inspirations. They are  “distances.” Outsides that resonate from within. “Distance—The tree  of  this green, the face  of  these lines” (Ettinger 1993, 9).
