Anne Corwin, self-described engineer, science geek, cat appreciator, hyperlexic infovore, and maker of various and random quasi-functional objects, explains how entering a room is different for an autistic: I would probably walk  into the room and see “check patterns” before even being able  to identify the door as a door and the tablecloth as a tablecloth! [. . .] The  process of “resolving patterns and shapes and forms into familiar objects” is actually a semi-conscious one for  me. [. . .] I often tend to sit  on floors and other surfaces even if furniture is available, because it’s a lot  easier to identify “flat surface a person can sit  on” than it is to sort the environment into chunks like  “couch,” “chair,” “floor,” and “coffee table.” [. . .] There is much more. There is always more. (2008)
