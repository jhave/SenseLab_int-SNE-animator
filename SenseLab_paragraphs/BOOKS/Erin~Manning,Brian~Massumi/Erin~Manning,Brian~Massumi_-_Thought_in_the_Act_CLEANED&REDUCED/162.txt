The  sensorimotor organization of  the body in its  sequential formfollowing is subverted by the force of the visionary. To generate a movement, the dancer must move beyond the form of what was and learn how to “sense motion traces.” This  opens up movement to its otherness, similarly to the way  Proust talks about the necessity of opening language to “a  kind of  foreign language within language, which is neither another language nor a rediscovered patois, but a becoming-other of language, a minoritization of this major language, a delirium that carries it off, a witch’s line that escapes the dominant system” (Deleuze 1997, 5).
