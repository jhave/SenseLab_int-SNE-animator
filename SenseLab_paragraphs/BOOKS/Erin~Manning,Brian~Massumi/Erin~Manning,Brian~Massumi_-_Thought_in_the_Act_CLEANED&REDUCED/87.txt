Tweaked toward “the what happens next? of life” (AG 2002, 42–43), concrescence is a taking of subjective form. Its forces converge into a thisness of experience that immediately interfuses with events in the making. To be is to be had in a flash. “The organism-that-persons drags its whole world along as a pull-toy” (AG 2002, 3). Organism that persons: “a local agitation that shakes the whole universe” (Whitehead 1968,  133). A populated field of alterant-altering interfusion.
