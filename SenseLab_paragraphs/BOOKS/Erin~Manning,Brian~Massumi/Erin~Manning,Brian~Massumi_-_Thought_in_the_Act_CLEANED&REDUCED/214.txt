Accidents happen, filling an individual canvas like No Title Yet, No. 3 with a vibratory self-relating. The  fore-to-back two-way movement-through detains in that individual painting, for  a luminous moment (telling nothing of day), the moving back and forth across paintings  and series  of forms tracing themselves in a rhythm of appearing and disappearing.4 One painting can call another actively back into the painting  process because each detains the movement of the whole in itself. The paintings-series, severally as a whole, resonate in each individual painting. The individual painting vibrates with the whole of the series, whose movement it holds in its self (relating).
