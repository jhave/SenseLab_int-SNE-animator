As our time in the forest was drawing to a close, so too was the Technologies of Lived Abstraction event series. Generating the Impossible was meant to be the final event in the series. The SenseLab has  never differentiated itself from its activities. Its mode of existence is entirely project based. It never saw itself as an organization with a claim to existence separate from what it does. It  never aspired to become a self-preserving or  self-reproducing institution within which or  in the name of which activities took place. It takes its own dedication to the emergent and the ephemeral seriously: it would continue to operate as long as its projects propelled themselves, preferring to die  rather than to ossify. The  end of  the event series  thus raised the inevitable question: had the SenseLab lived itself out? Had it performed, to the best of its ability, its function of consolidating new ways  of coming together around research-creation techniques to create relational environments? Did the mode of collective relational existence that was the SenseLab still  have a reason for being?
