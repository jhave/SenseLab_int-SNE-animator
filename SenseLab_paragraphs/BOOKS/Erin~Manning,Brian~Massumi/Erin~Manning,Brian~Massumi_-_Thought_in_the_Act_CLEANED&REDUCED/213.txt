“In  painting,” Ettinger says, “there is a lot of treating what is not going to be there any more.” But “no more is not the end of it.” No more is where “I” find myself, not yet—again. Still painting, across series  that may end but never come to a definitive close. “Sometimes two paintings from different series  based on the same image call  to each other, and something that happens in the new one will  demand a change in an old  one. This was the case with No Title Yet, No. 3 and Eurydice, No. 23” (Ettinger 2010).
The  painting process opens itself to formative forces entering its field and moving across the paintings and their seriations, in both directions. Something happens.
