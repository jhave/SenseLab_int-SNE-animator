Ettinger’s work brushes against the gaze  without relying upon it.  The friend cannot be represented. The Monet lies open, not to be looked at, but to be thought-felt. A kind of “involuntariness in the seeing” (Ettinger 2010). “Painting is not the image; painting is not the visual” (Ettinger 1993, 72). The seeing happens almost by  accident, spiriting across tremulous color lines—traces—that are less visual than vibrational: lines fielded.
