“I hear the rocks and the trees” (Mukhopadhyay in Miller 2003, 54). For autism researcher Simon Baron-Cohen, to hear the rocks and the trees on an equal footing with the voices of children is a sign  of what he calls  “mindblindness.” Mindblindness is generally defined as an inability to develop an awareness of what is in the mind of another human. To have mindblindness, Baron-Cohen suggests, is to lack empathy. It is to be generally unrelational. He says that this is what defines autistics (1995).3
Yet from the autistic, we  hear neither a rejection of  the human, nor a turning away from relation. What we hear is an engagement with the more-than human: “I attend to everything the same way with no discrimination, so that the caw  of the crow in the tree  is as clear and important as the voice of the person I’m walking with” (Krumins in Miller 2003, 86). And an engagement with a more textured relating: “My world is organized around textures. [. . .] All emotions, perceptions, my whole world [. . .] [has] been influenced by textures” (Krumins in Miller 2003, 87).
