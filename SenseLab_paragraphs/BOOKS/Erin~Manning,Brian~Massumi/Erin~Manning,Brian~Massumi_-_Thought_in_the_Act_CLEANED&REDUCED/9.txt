The hope is that this might be seen as a book of techniques—techniques for  composing with creative practice, for  composing emergent collectivities, for  composing thought in the multiplicitous act.  Technique, as we understand it throughout, belongs to the act.  Techniques are not descriptive  devices—they are  springboards. They are  not framing devices—they activate a practice from within. They set in motion.
