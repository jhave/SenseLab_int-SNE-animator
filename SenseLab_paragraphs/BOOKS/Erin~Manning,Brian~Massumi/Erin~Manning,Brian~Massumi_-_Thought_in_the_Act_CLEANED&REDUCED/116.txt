The  sharing of the activation contour passes through the middle. Of itself, it is in neither register. It is in transit. It is trans-manner, trans-register, trans-order: transductive.7  What is in trans-manner is amodal: neither in one modality of life  nor another, but in the coming-to-pass of their disjunctive synthesis.8 In the rhythm of the passing event that is life in this moment. The visual form is not displayed. The movement is not portrayed in it. Life splays into it.
Could not precisely the same be  said  of  the relation between movement and language? Language and vision? The different planes of life come concertedly together in their disjunction, linked eventfully in an analogy that is grounded in their difference from each other, rather than any formal identity or resemblance. The  dynamic analogy of amodal superposition is what Walter Benjamin, discussing the relation between language, gesture, and vision, termed a “nonsensuous similarity” (Benjamin 2004; Massumi 2011, 105–10, 123–24). Just like that. Just like this. One, two, one, one-two one-two, sprayed multiply across the registers of an experientially splayed event.
