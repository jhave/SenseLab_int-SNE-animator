We  were  fully prepared for  the open-endedness. What we  were  not prepared for  was  losing our starting point before we set  forth. The  event lost  site  of  itself. During our year  of  planning Generating the  Impossible, the Society for  Art  and Technology (SAT) crossed a  threshold we  had not anticipated. The  renovations scheduled to improve the site  and add the immersive interactive dome dubbed the SATosphere were caught in the aftereffects of the 2008 economic crisis. The  resulting budget deficit necessitated a rethinking of the SAT’s operating model. Henceforth, all activities would be  called upon to generate monetary returns. We  could still  work at the SAT in the SATosphere, but the new model required projects  that were  not fully subsidized from outside sources to earn their keep by bringing in a paying public. This  was an obvious problem for a project meant to explore the gift  as a living critique of the neoliberal economy. The  SAT’s earlier proposition was  that we “explode the gallery,” creating flows that might open the site of art to cacophonous interventions poised between modes of address (the conference paper), display (the art  exhibition), and collaboration (the participatory installation), as well as opening it onto its outside, reconnecting it to its urban surroundings. Now there would be no “explosion.”
