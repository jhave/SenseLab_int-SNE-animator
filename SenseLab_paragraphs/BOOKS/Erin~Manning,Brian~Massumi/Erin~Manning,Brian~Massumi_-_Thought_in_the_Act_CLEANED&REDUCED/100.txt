The  piece will be made of these differentials, these tensions, these contrastive intensities of  the moment, on every register, as  what happens on one also  rhythmically accrues to the others. The  composition will jump from gesture to wording, and back again, forever circling, swaddling feeling. Movement will  cut  into the wording, speaking will  interrupt the moving. At times they will  coincide. Cut in, cut  out, fold around and together. Rising, falling, resonating, just like  this, just like  that, disjunct, rolling in difference together.
