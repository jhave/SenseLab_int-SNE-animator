At the limit, the painting process is “holographic” (Ettinger 2010): at the same time as it makes a given image, thickens into an individual painting, it makes “a mental image that opens onto an interplay of purely thought relations weaving a whole” (Deleuze 1986, 18). This purity of painting-thinking, colorfully felt,  “renders impotent the imagination” (Deleuze 1986, 48).
For  “the whole has  become Simultaneity” (Deleuze 1986,  48).  Timecrystal. A duration not of time’s passing, but of its making taking painterly form. Pulsing. Yet and again. No more is not the end of it.
Imagination suspended in the “immensity” of an “absolute domain of luminous simultaneity, [. . .] of the changing whole that is Spirit” confirming  itself, self-choosing (indistinguishably from what is chosen; Deleuze 1986,  48).
