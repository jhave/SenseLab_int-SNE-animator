However the field of relational co-composition crests—be it in language, through art,  in movement, in politics—it will do so in an emergent attuning. In  Generating the Impossible, we  hope to make that attunement take central stage toward the register of the politico-aesthetic event. Whatever the register, what counts is the activation of a heterogeneous field of polyrhythmic expressibility toward a next determinate event of  expression. What is being attuned, in the final analysis, is not only the individuals involved, to each other. More fundamentally, it is the quasi-chaos of the initial conditions that is attuning itself to the singularity of the coming event of co-composition. What transpires cannot be credited to the individuals as such. The event credits itself with their coming-differently-together.
