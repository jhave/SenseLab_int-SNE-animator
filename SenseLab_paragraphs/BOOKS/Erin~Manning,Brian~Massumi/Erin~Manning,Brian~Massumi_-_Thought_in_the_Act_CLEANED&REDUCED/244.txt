Monet as such—as painter, as impressionist, as “artist” predefined—is not the friend. His greening is the intercessor. Greening is the force that extends beyond Monet into a  perceptual tendency—a violeting, perhaps—as it enters Ettinger’s work. It is not so much that the trees in Monet’s Water Lily Pond are “green” or that faces  in Ettinger come out “violet.” The green trees, the violet faces, activating a tendency in the work toward a more-than of color, an unseen vibrational light. Toward a crystalline state. We see the canvas as though through a crystal, clouding, coloring. We see not color as such but resonances, intervals, cuttings-in. We  see greening, beyond representation. Less in color or as line, than as a formative forceeffect that emerges when the process takes over, a precarious balancing between what is seen, thought, and felt.  Greening, violeting as the force for  activation that creates a bridge between two works participating in a shared outside.
