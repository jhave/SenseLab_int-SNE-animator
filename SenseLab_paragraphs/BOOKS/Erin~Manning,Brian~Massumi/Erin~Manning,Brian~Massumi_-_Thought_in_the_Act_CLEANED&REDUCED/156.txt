Forsythe describes this technique as having a vision (2003a; Manning 2013,  86).  Having a vision, in the moving, means moving beyond this body, this form, toward the unfolding of how movement will be affected by the middling, which will flow  into it from the future. A dizzying task, but one that cleaves movement from its habitual sensorimotor cues  and alignments, inviting it to invent with a bodying. Two  versions of cueing and aligning are co-active here, in the field  of double vision. There is the habitual sensorimotor organization of the body in its causal flow—a forward step cueing to gravity, aligning to the slope of  the floor—and the Forsythe Company’s technique of cueing to movement-moving in a nonlocal field of co-action and collective aligning in counterpoint to the field’s patterned interplay.
