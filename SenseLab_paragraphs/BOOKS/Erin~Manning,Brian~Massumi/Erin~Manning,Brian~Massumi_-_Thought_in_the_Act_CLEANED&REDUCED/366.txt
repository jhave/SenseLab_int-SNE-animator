“Render visible,” Klee  said; do  “not render or  reproduce the visible” (quoted in Deleuze and Guattari 1987,  342).  What is rendered visible in painted forms, for Klee, are the generative forces in-forming the aesthetic event. For  Generating the  Impossible, we  propose to activate the generative  forces of a form of research-creation encounter—not so much render them visible as multimodally palpable, in an unforeseen unfolding composition of sense modes, spaces, roles, and rhythms of transition entering into unaccustomed resonance. Generating the Impossible’s proposition is to render palpable the force of the event’s self-articulating expression. This is a radical empirical proposition, in James’s sense of the term: the singular relational force of a welling event, as James emphasizes, is as real as any of the generic forms or finished contents that may enter into it as building blocks or come out of it as products.
