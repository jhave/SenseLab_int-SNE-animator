What is transparent in the painting process as an intensive relational whole is one painting’s, a whole series’, a given face’s,  direct  relation  to another, and to one another, in immediate distance in proximity. One resonates in the other without detouring along the axis  of either spectatorship or authorial intention. Each  vibrates with the whole of the others, without a mediating look between them. No decision comes between the painting process and its  perpetual rebeginnings’ continuing. The  formative  force of the painting process rearises, open-wholly, with each beginning. No  mediation—intercession. All distance pulsing in the dynamic transparency of an immediate formative proximity. Becoming-crystalline of the painting process.
