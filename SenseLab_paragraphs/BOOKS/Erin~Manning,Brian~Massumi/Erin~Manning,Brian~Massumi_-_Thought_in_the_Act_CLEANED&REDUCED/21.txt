“My  boundary between imagining and experiencing something was a very delicate one. Perhaps it still is. So many times I still need to cross-check with Mother, or  someone who can understand my  voice now, whether an incident really happened around my  body or  presence” (Mukhopadhyay 2008, 22). Presence with, in, and around a budding field-becoming, in patient attentiveness toward what the  field  wants. Uncertainty in the aroundness: where does the body begin and end? Where is  the relay between imagination and experience? The  coming to further expression of the field in conversation, for cross-checking, moves the center of gravity of the experience into another field, that of language. But this is poetic language, not strictly fact seeking—a language for story, a language that holds onto the tensile oscillation of imagining and experiencing, that composes with the threshold of expressibility that was already active in the field, tuning  to expression where there is not yet  either a fully bloomed object nor a fully flowered subject—only the intensely experiencing-imagining bud of a qualitative becoming toward making sense in language.
