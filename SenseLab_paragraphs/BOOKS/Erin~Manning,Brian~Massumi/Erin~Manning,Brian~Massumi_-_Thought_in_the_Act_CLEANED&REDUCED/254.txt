A face  from outside the process may cut  into the thread of transconnection, “friending” the process. The  face of da Vinci’s St. John the Baptist, unlooked upon in an open book beside the easel, suddenly “comes out from a displaced Eurydice face”  (Ettinger 2010). The  paintings/series open onto their outside. Through the same operations by which they form an intensive relational whole of their own in their openness to each other, they take their outside in, opening the whole to the world at large. It is not the form of the outside face  or figure that enters the painting. What enters is its  friendly, troubling “vibration,” joining a different resonant field, to new effect, from an effectively contiguous distance, with ingressive formative force.
None of this, the artist says, is a matter of choice. She exercises her willpower “mainly at the beginning, in the choice of  which image to use” (Ettinger 2010). Her persistence, her discipline, is to surrender to the painting  process the decision as to when something will  emerge, and what. “Color,” she  specifies, “is not part of the beginning decision . . . The  lines and the colors come together” in the relay from xerography to brushstroking. In each successive painting and series, she simply “starts with the same color as the last, until the painting asks for another color” (Ettinger 2010).
