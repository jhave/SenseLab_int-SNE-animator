We wanted at all costs to avoid the voluntaristic connotations often carried  by words like “improvisation,” “emergence,” and “invention.” There would be no question of just “letting things flow,” as if simply unconstraining interaction were sufficient to enable something “creative” to happen. In our experience, unconstrained interaction rarely yields worthwhile effects. Its results typically lack  rigor, intensity, and interest for those not directly involved, and as a consequence are low on follow-on effects. Effects cannot occur in the absence of a cause. The question is what manner of causation is to be activated: simple or complex; functionally proscribed or catalyzing of variation; linear or relational (co-causal)?
