Potlatch is a  practice for  reorienting and remodulating the field of exchangeability. This  reorienting, as Mauss points out, involves a giving of “a part of one’s nature” (1966,  10). We take this not to suggest a subjectoriented view of donor and receiver, but as an acknowledgement that what connects the social group is the sharing of the more-than of their individual  subjectivities in the context of  a ritual technique of  hospitality and event-based generosity.
