Perhaps the difference between the environmental  awareness of the autistic and that of  neurotypicals is that neurotypicals always fuse the entertainment of  the environment with an immediate availing themselves of affordances. The  autistic becomes the field, integrally cocompositional with it.  For the neurotypical, the field  comes already saturated with affordances the field  proposes, with openings or object-buds offering themselves as conduits for the field’s coming expression, already oriented efficaciously. This  efficacious tendency in neurotypicals lends the field  more “naturally” to the kind of cross-checking that is for  factfinding, rather than for story-making in a poetic sense, as it was in Mukhopadhyay’s case.  For both neurotypicals and autistics, and all along the spectrum of neurodiversity, it is only beyond the moment, with memory, and with the retellings memory makes possible, that objects will stand out clearly, sagely observing the boundary between experience and imagining. In the moment, they are fused with field  effects that are moving and ephemeral and at the threshold.
