What must language do to become-visionary? What are its techniques for  opening language to the foreignness, as Proust says,  of its becomingother? In  Virginia Woolf, the “as if” plays this role, folding as it does the present into its double: “She began to go slowly upstairs, with her hand on the bannisters, as if she  had left  a party, where now this friend now that had flashed back her face,  her voice [that’s  me,  silly!];  had shut the door and gone out and stood alone, a single figure against the appalling night, or rather, to be accurate, against the stare of this matter-of-fact June morning” (Woolf 1992, 33). As-if, the holding pattern of a difference in time, time looped onto itself toward the impossibility of getting the story straight once and for all. Not just “it could have been this way,” but “it was this way, and that way as well,  at the same time”: disjunctive synthesis, just like that. Asif—“straight” in the middle.
