Our goal  was  not simply to describe the complexity of a work’s workings, but to activate its modalities of thought, its rhythms, in a new concertation. This  meant finding our way  into artistic practices to reconnect with philosophy’s outside, to endeavor to make felt  how philosophy can co-compose with other creative practices. Too often, writing stands to the side, outside the action, as though the “real” work happened elsewhere, as though what writing was equipped to do with “real” practices was merely to describe them—or to proscribe for them, in judgment. We took it as the task  of this book to make it felt,  in its own rhythms, that writing is as real and creative a practice as any, and that it lives in an ecology of experience, with all the doings adrop, and all the makings enacting.
