The largest and most visible proposition was the construction of a work “for  the forest” that came to be called The  Mi(d)st: a 100-meter length of repurposed mosquito netting that was  painstakingly stretched across an arm of the lake  on the far end from camp. The  Mi(d)st  grew  from a stray comment from one participant about the captivating ephemerality of the morning and evening mist that rose from the lake, crossed with a platform for relation donated by Nathaniel Stern, who offered his  rope-based “Sentimental Construction” concept to the group as a proposition for  collective  improvisation.7 The  Mi(d)st  “caught” the captivating mist in its  net. It also  reflected its own form in the water, creating a play across surfaces that visually expressed the interpenetration of processes the event sought to produce on other levels. Alan  Prohm also gifted a proposition for group reappropriation  growing from his  “loom” projects, which are  similarly rope based. The Tubular Loom is strung, not unlike a spider web for people, between site-specific structures (in  our case,  two trees). Once mounted, it serves as an invitation to ungrounded movement as participants run, crawl, or sidle through it, experiencing altered proprioceptive states.
