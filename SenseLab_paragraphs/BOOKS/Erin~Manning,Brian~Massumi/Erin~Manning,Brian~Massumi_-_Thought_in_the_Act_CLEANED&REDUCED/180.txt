The  moment of clarity appears from the wash of movement-moving. The clarity was of course always already there, active in the midst, if eclipsed by  the velocity, the agility, of the movement-moving. Clarity is a signal for the viewer. Look again, it says.  Think-feel the difference.  Donâ€™t forget: the touch comes between the moving and the speaking, recalibrating not only the motional but also the notional. Think touch as that which acts  on the flow to pull from it a clearing of relation.
