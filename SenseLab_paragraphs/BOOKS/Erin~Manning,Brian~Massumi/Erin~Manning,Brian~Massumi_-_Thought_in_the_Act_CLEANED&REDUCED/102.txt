Woolf’s in the Middle
“What is of interest,” Gilles Deleuze always maintained, “is the milieu, what happens in the middle. It is not by chance that the greatest velocity is in the middle” (1979,  95).  The  middle: between rising and falling. It  takes extreme speed, perhaps infinite speed, to pass  between rising and falling. It takes extreme speed, at least at the velocity of thought, to pass  between language and gesture.
