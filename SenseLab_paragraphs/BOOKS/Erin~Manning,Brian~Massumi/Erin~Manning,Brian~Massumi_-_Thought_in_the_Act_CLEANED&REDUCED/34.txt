The  experience is then all  movement-texture,  complexly patterned, full  of change and transition, teemingly differentiated. You’re  surfing the crowd even as the crowd is surfing you. Despite the rush, this is not without joy.  You  revel in the fluidity of your trajectory, without focusing on it as a feeling-tone separate from the movement. You have performed an integral dance of attention, seemingly without thinking.
But you were  thinking, with  your movement. Your every movement was a performed analysis of the field’s composition from the angle of its affordance for getting-ahead. Entering the dance of attention, your perceiving converged with your moving activity, and your activity was  your thinking. You entered a mode of environmental awareness in which to perceive is to enact thought, and thought is directly relational. This  actively relational thinking is also  an expression of the field, but in a different mode than storytelling, poetic or not, with no immediate need for language, satisfying itself at a level  with the body’s movements: expression a-bodying.
