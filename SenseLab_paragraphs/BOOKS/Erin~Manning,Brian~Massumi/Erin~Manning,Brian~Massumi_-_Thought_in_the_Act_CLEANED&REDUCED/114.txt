To make visible what can only be felt  is not the same as performing a move. It is not to imitate or  reproduce a movement form. “Things happen, but are not performed,” Forsythe warns his dancers. “You don’t want to perform your work.” “Do  it without portraying” (Forsythe 2011, Nov. 10). You do  it without displaying. You don’t perform it in that sense. You  just, like,  enter into the sensation. Field  the point, chain the sensations, and the audience also  will  feel  the movement’s making, in the flash-form of its visual effect. They will  eye  your differential gestural nexus at a distance. The  activation of  your point-field will  activate the optical spray of  their field  of  vision (what James Gibson calls  the optical  array; 1986).
