The touching reset of relational movement creates a hiatus in movementmoving. This  invites us to see dance moving not into form, but into the sprays, the traces, through which form spreads. Sprays: the folding through of movement becoming rhythmic milieu. Sprays: the affective surplus of the sensorimotor, the curve that exceeds this habitual stance, the moving at the point of inflection that tunes toward a collective individuation not only of  the dancers, but of  the whole field  of  activation, the field  that includes, at its limit, the folds of Mrs Dalloway as well  as every movement proposition that went into each of the choreographed sequences. Everything is there in abeyance, suspended in each movement, lingering in each utterance. But what makes the work work is not the everything, but the overflowing singularity of  how this  point of  inflection tunes to this rhythmic fold at any-point, in the counterpoint of the notional and the motional. Stricken. Reset:  from lingering to just like that.
