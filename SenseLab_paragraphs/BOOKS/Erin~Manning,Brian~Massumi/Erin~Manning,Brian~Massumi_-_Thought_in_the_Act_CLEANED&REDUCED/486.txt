This  trickstering of the trickster figure made the free radical a looming, unidentifiable presence. Since no one knew who or how many it was,  its interventions were  not necessarily discernible. This  meant that at each stage of the event we were  obliged to be on the lookout for  occurrences that might be laid  to free-radical intercession. How the free radical might be operative in the alter-economy we were  creating was an ongoing, open question. Through its perhaps spectral multiplication, the free radical came to embody the event’s outside. It became the ubiquitous figure of an intervening outside force of unsettlement that could not be definitively pinned on any one individual or identifiable group of individuals within the larger group. This  apparition of the outside among us worked to remind us that there was no absolute “inside” to the event. Its own transductive figure was of the inside folding out, from Mekoos to the city  and beyond.
