The  final event in the series, like the first,  relates to a challenge coming to the SenseLab from outside. Monique Savoie, founding director of the SAT, said she had been thinking about what an “exploded gallery” (galerie éclatée) might mean and how it might be invented. Her question came out of the SAT’s experience of constructing a gallery space for  new media art  on its ground floor. The  gallery project had been unsatisfying, and was  discontinued after a year. Savoie attributed the failure to the unsuitability of the traditional white-cube gallery model to new-media-based interactive arts, and to the traditions of ephemeral, performance-based art  practices from earlier periods with which they are  often in resonance. She  envisioned a gallery that burst beyond the limits of the traditional model. What would a “gallery” be like that didn’t confine itself to formally delimited exhibition spaces but leaked out into the corridors and closets, through the administrative offices, onto the roof and across the building’s façade, saturating an entire architectural field?  How could such a “gallery” extend its  field even further, onto the sidewalk in front, to the mosque behind, through the inner-city park next door, toward Chinatown down the street, sending tendrils into the city  surrounds? How could the reinvention of the SAT as an exploded gallery extend or intensify what research-creation can do, and how might that experimentation infiltrate, on its own exploding terms, the neoliberal project of the Quartier des  Spectacles? Savoie gently suggested that helping answer these questions might be a project the SenseLab would be interested in taking on.
