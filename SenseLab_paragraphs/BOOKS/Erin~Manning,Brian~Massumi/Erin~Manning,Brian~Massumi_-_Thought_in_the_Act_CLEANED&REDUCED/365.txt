It is only out of chaos that the impossible can come. But as William James notes, there is no such thing as pure chaos. There is quasi-chaos: a field  of divergences and convergences, comings-together and goings-apart, concatenation and separation, already tending to sort itself out in the determination of a thisness (James 1996,  65). Chaos, in and of itself, can never be experienced. What is experienced is the commotion of determinationsto-come vying for  expression in an overfull field  of  potential relations. This quasi-chaos pulsates with potential technicities—as-yet-unstructured improvisations. This is why initial conditions of chaos can be an enabling constraint, and not just a disabling of existing genres. The vagueness of the event’s initial conditions enables it to come actively into itself, emergently modulating its  dynamic form as it passes through the phases of its  own occurrence. The event-in-the-making’s self-modulation in-forms an occurrent individuation. The event draws itself out into a line of formation that folds in and through its welling expression, describing the abstract shape of the event it will have been. From chaos emerges what Paul Klee calls the “pure and simple line” of an event of expression’s dynamic unfolding. Creative chaos is the self-drawing of a pure and simple abstract line, running from the commotional fullness of  an impossible “what if”  to the “here now” of an event risking its own singular individuation.
