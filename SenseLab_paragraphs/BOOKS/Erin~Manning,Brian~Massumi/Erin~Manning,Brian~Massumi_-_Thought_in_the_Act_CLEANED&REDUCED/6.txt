In our own acts  of writing together, we have had to learn how to ripple the difference between two stone-hard heads. While negotiating our different ways  of dropping into the breach of the practices, we have found ways  to encounter together. We have had to learn to compose an uneasy, two-headed thinking in the act,  across a multiplicity of practices. Uneasy, because thought together is not thought controlled. Uneasy, because writing  in the thinking is an intrinsically fragile art,  however many heads are involved. Uneasy, but beautifully intense. Because when skulls bump, the resulting brain-wave interference-patterns can be a revelation to both.
