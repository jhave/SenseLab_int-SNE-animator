This  encounter with not knowing—epitomized, while we  were in Frankfurt, by  the development of  a new piece called Whole in the  Head (2011)—keeps the process alive and uncertain. With Whole in  the  Head, weeks of rehearsal were  completely unmoored two hours before the opening  performance when Forsythe decided to change the piece, using only certain sections of what had been rehearsed and reordering them. In keeping with his idiosyncratic practice of the what-if, Forsythe then fundamentally altered the piece for each of the nine performances to come. This was not just staging. It was  a rigorous engagement with “seeing what’s actually  in front of [your] eyes,” the what-if of movement activated both on the stage-space of performance and in its co-composition with other performances just past, a movement precise with training but still  open to regeneration.
