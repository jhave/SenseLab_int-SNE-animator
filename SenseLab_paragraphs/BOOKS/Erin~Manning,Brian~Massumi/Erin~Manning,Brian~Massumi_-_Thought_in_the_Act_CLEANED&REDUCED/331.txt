Failures, for the SenseLab, have come to be thought of as opportunities for  the emergence of new techniques of experimentation: they push the collective toward an engagement with the limit of what can be thought/ created in a particular context. Techniques of relation access their creative potential most when they operate at the edge of what they are preconceived to do.  For this to happen, they must embrace the eventuality of their own failure as a creative factor in their process.
