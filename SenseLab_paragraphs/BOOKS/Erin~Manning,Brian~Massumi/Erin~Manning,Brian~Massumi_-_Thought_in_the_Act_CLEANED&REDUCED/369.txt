For Félix  Guattari, to metamodel is to render palpable lines of formation, starting from no one model in particular, actively taking into account the plurality of models vying for  fulfillment. Metamodeling takes forces of formation actively into account from the angle of their variations to come.37 The  modeling is “meta-” because the lines it draws are “abstract.” They are abstract in the sense that the formative tendencies they map are eventfully more-than present, returning across iterations, in continuing variation. Events are both here-now, actual in their occasions, and always in excess of their present iterations. Metamodeling seeks to map their reformative excess.
