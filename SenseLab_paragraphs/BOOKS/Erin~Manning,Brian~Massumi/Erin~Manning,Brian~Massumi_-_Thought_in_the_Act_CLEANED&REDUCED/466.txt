This  ceremony was  one aspect of the gift  economy at the basis  of the event. Over the year  previous to the event, we had set up various ways  of creating informal funding and resource-sharing structures to ensure that no participant was excluded for lack of funds.5 As with past events, we also worked with a local grocer to supply low-cost food for on-site preparation during the event.6  Montreal-based SenseLab participants offered couches and extra rooms to accommodate those who chose not to or were  unable to pay  for  hotels for  the city  segment. And  those of us with institutional backing, or with personal funds to spare, pooled our money for allocation on the basis  of need. To the extent possible, the event attempted to activate alter-economies based on mutual aid.
