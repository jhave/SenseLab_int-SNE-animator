The  first  event, Dancing the Virtual, took place in summer 2005 as the inaugural initiative in a  series of  events collectively titled Technologies of Lived  Abstraction.18  This  first  event approached the problem from the angle of movement, specifically the question of what constitutes a “movement of thought.” The organizing refrain was a formula from philosopher José Gil, who was invited to participate in the event, that “what moves as a body returns as the movement of thought” (Gil 2002, 124). This concept holds that every movement of the body is doubled by a virtual movementimage expressing its abstract form, in its unfolding. The dimension of virtuality is at once the movement’s potential for thought and, associated with that, its potential for repetition and variation. Pragmatically, this concept built a self-referential dimension into the event. The event would gather into itself an awareness of its own abstract dimensions, accompanying its every move with a protoconceptualization in action: a thinking flush with its unfolding that would contribute to the self-piloting of what would happen.
