retrofitted into an implicit opposition between the mental and the physical,  mind and body. The  only way  to avoid this dichotomizing refit, the only way  to restore movement to the gestural nexus that is its native element, the only way  to respect the dynamic spray of movement in and of itself—as well as in its form-flashing splay between other planes of experience—is to say that movement embodies nothing but itself.  Movement never embodies anything. It just bodies-forth, at any-point. Embodiment is the wrong concept. Just “bodying” is better. Movement goes  a-bodying.
