Faces.  They come and go. They drift, resizing themselves as they shift. At times, they separate from the figures supporting them. The  figures also come and go. They multiply forth, no sooner to recede. Vicissitudes of face and figure move through the painting series, in ephemeral community. Their restless movement is not governed by the principles of portraiture, nor by those of figuration in any traditional sense. Bracha Ettinger says of her paintings that they “have their own formative axis  that goes  through the painting process” (2010). That axis,  she  explains, is light. The faces and figures that come and go move by light.
