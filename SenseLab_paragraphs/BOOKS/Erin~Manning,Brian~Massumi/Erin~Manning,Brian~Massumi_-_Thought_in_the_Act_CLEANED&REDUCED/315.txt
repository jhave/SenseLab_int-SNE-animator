The  focus on liminal activities, on the active transitions between phases of the event, had to take into account the inaugural passage: the initial passing  of the threshold into the event. A major determinant to the success or failure of the event would be what participants brought with them through the threshold to the event in terms of their expectations about the coming  group interactions and their individual status and positioning within them. How the initial entry is organized, and especially the physical layout and affective tonality of the space into which participants enter, influences the postures that will be assumed. The  manner of welcome and the initial impression created of the space of participation are essential working parts of the event machinery, not neutral accessories. Together they constitute an apparatus of postural priming that embeds certain presuppositions and anticipatory tendencies in the event’s unfolding. The  challenge was  to disable participants’ habitual presuppositions—those tendencies engrained in all of us by the conventional genres of interaction in the art and academic worlds. Key was  to find a mode of entry that opened the field  of participation to unforeseeable interactions without destabilizing participants, rendering them reticent or defensive.
