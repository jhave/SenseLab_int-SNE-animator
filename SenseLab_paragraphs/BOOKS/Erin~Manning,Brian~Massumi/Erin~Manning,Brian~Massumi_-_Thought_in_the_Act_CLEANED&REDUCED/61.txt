The  “neuro” is everywhere in the air today. Neuroarchitecture, neuroaesthetics, neurocriticism. We have advanced the term “neurodiversity” here in order to problematize the “neuro” no less than the “typical.” Certain of today’s neurocurrents, those informed by embodied cognition and its younger offspring enactive perception, converge in some respects with the account developed here. We are uneasy, however, with the general excitement generated by  recent advances in brain imaging technology, which have been met with another wave of the cyclic craze for  finding neural “correlates” of experiential events. The models, admittedly, are vastly more complex than earlier paradigms of localization, nuanced as they are with notions of systemic feedback, distributed networks, and emergent patterning of neural activity. In spite of these very real advances, the problem remains for us that the impulse to identify an experiential event with a brain state tends to take precedence, and is too often given the first and last  word.
