illumination. The accumulation of transparency that is white is also “the simplest, brightest, first, opaque occupation of space” (Goethe 1970, §147: 61). Space  is an emergence, also  on the continuum. It emerges in the course of white’s formative self-relating. Next come forms. Light is not shed on preexisting forms. Figures emerge from the shadows variegating the color field. They do not emerge from the shadows in the sense of appearing for what they already are  when shadow is dissipated by a shedding of light. Figures form between regions of shadow. Their contours take at the boundary  between different degrees of clouding. They are  the liminal relation between regions of the formative field, seen as such. They are  relational beings of light—of transparency, translucency, and whiteness—with their own degree of luminous quality. “Between the white of the veil  and the white of the background, the face  holds itself up like  a fish” in the turbulent sea of white and color becoming. This  figure “can lose  its outline in giving way  to a soft  focus . . . without losing anything of its reflecting power” (Deleuze 1986, 93). It can drift, without losing its powers of reflecting, its powers of relation.
