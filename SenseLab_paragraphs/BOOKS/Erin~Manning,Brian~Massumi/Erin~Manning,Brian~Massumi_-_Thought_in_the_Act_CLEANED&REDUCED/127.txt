Take  it to the extreme. Take  movement to its limit—“and then go further” (Forsythe 2011,  Nov. 10).  Movement doesn’t actually stop. It  subsides into itself. It relaxes back into its field, for the reoccurring. It collapses back into the nonlocality of its any-point, the unlocalized interval of no perceptible movement. In  every movement’s rise  and fall,  at any-point, there is an imperceptible interval where the rising and falling coincide. Waves collect. overbalance. and fall.
