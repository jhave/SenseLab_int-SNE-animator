The  relational soup could be anything at all.  The  enabling constraint was that whatever form it took, it should give the emissary an experience of the host group—a taste of that group’s process, modalities of interaction and organizing, affective tonality, and concerns. Sharing an actual meal was a simple default option. Whatever the relational soup proved to be, the emissary would return home with a “recipe” for it. The  recipe was something that packaged the relational-soup activity into a technique of relation that could serve as a formula to be adapted for use  by the home group upon the emissary’s return if the technique of relation it encapsulated resonated with that group’s own process. The  recipe was one of the ways  letting go was integrated into the interaction, now tweaked toward an practice of the gift. The host group’s gift of a processual recipe was reciprocated in the form of a “process seed” brought by the emissary and left with the host group. The  seed  was sealed and was to be opened only after the event. It could be an object around which a group activity could be organized, or a set of procedures to be followed collectively. The simple default option of this technique of relation was  an actual plant seed  that would be cared for by the molecule in the period after the event.
