It  is precisely in terms of  the intensive feeling of  an open relational whole that Gilles Deleuze defines the spiritual. The  forces entering the field  of painting that transduce as vibrations are spiritual forces: forces of thought. Thought forcefully felt.  A thinking-feeling arising from the material dynamic of the painting process but in resonant/vibratory excess of its hour, and of the metric time of any of its determinate elements’ enduring. “The paintings contain duration” (Ettinger 2010). They do not contain faces  and figures in time. They contain time, in the trace-forming of faces and figures appearing-disappearing through connective resonation and in
self-relating vibration.
