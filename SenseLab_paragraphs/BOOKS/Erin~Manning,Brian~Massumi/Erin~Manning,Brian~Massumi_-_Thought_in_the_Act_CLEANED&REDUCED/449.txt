It was clear that Generating the Impossible could not function within these new conditions. The  event had to remain open to its undoing. Even had we had subsidies and been in a position to pay  for access, the SATosphere would have constrained us to a preestablished site  that already presumed to know how to manage what art  can be,  and what art  can do.  The  shift the SAT was  experiencing seemed all  too reminiscent of our initial concerns about research-creationâ€™s growing indebtedness to the capitalist economy and its enterprise model. Later, we would come back to the SAT with a project to creatively explore the tensions surrounding this shift, but we felt  we would not be prepared for this until after Generating the Impossible had carried our practices further. For now, we had to move on.
