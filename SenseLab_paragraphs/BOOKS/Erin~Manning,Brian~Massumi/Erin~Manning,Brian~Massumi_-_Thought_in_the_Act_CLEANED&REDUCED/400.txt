All  economies involve exchange. According to Deleuze and Guattari, exchange is only apparently organized according to a principle of equivalence that is applied punctually in each act  of  exchange between two individuals: for example, an equivalence between a good of one kind and another realized punctually in a trade. Exchange is not punctual. It has  a serial order that implicates a collectivity. The  series  of exchanges, Deleuze and Guattari argue, is in fact  organized as a function of a limit. The  limit is the “idea of the last  objects received, or rather receivable, on each side” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987,  437).  “Last” here does not mean “the most recent, nor the final, but rather the penultimate, the next to the last, the last  one before the apparent exchange loses  its appeal for the exchangers, or  forces them to modify their respective assemblages, to enter another assemblage” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 437). Appeal:  the idea of the limit is qualitative. The  limit-idea of the next-to-the-last exchange after which the series of exchanges would change intuitively informs each punctual act of trade. Thus there is a qualitative evaluation that underlies each “equivalence” produced by  a trade and sustains the possibility of the series  of exchanges continuing as before. The  appeal of sustaining the exchange activity is essentially the desirability of sustaining the way of life associated with the objects exchanged.
