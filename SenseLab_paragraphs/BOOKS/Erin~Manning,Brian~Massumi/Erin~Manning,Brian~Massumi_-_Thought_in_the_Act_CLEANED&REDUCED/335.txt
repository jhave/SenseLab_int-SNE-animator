This  somewhat brutal intervention on behalf of letting go was undertaken to focus on the notion that to be  a success in its  own terms the kind of process the SenseLab was  experimenting with would have to be essentially disseminatory. The  projects were  not about ownership, either of products or of the process itself. They were  not about credit; they were about creativity. Ultimately, they were  about processual contagion: how self-organizing techniques and intensities of collaborative experimentation can self-propagate. We hoped that participants would come to view  their contributions as gifts  to creative contagion.
