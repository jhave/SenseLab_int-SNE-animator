Philosophy’s outside is a generative environment. Philosophy does not yet know how to speak. Its thinking is active, uneasy because always in the encounter. Giving words to the encounter is what we have attempted to do  here. Not to solve the riddle of how art  and philosophy, activism and philosophy, move together, but to ask  ourselves what writing can do  to make thought-felt what art  can do,  with philosophy.
Every  practice is a mode of  thought, already in the act.  To  dance: a thinking in movement. To paint: a thinking through color. To perceive in the everyday: a thinking of the world’s varied ways  of affording itself. In each of these cases, and the others encountered in this book, the practice in question will be construed as a mode of thought creatively in the act.
