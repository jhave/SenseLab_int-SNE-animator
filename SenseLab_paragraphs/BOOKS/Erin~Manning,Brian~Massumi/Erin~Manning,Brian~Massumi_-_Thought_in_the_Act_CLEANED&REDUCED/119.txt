The  general idea of  these habitual sensorimotor sequences is what embodied cognition and enactive perception theory (and earlier, Gestalt) have called “body schemas.” Body schemas are  explained in terms of “implicit knowledge.” These theories typically appeal to the implicit knowledge of body schemas to account for the thought-like aspect of action. Body schemas are  presented as the thinking of the body, in the body. What is “embodied” are the schemas. What is “enacted” is the general meaning of the adaptive situation. Maxine Sheets-Johnstone rightly observes that, far from grasping the manner of thinking incumbent in bodily movement as  such, the concept of  body schema implicitly construes what occurs, thought-like, at the heart of movement, moving on its  own level, in its own register, as mental (why else call it embodied cognition?). What other conceivable status could the element of general meaning have but mental?
