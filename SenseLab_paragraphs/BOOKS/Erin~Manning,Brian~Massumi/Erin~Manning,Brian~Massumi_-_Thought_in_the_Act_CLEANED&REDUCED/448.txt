The site’s modalities were  given in advance, and any experimentation would have to happen within its domed structure. Not only that, but experimentation would be more regulated: channeled toward exploring the potentials of a given artistic platform—that of this particular immersive environment. This exerted pressure on artistic activity to conform to a content-providing paradigm, prelimiting the eventfulness of the process and its  participatory intensity by  reinstating a dichotomy between the artist/technological expert and the paying audience. The  site thus went from being an open proposition (the SAT as spatial-conceptual catalyzer of  action, a platform for  relation in building form) to a highstakes arena branded by its own proprietary technical system, one requiring  special access and inside knowledge. In addition, the SAT’s underlying assumption in this new phase was that artistic activity should ideally provide “deliverables” to other sectors. The SAT was facing a Faustian bargain: die an ignominious death by debt, or fall more into step with the enterprise model of the neoliberal economy. Was  it having the last  “glass,” crossing the threshold into a different relational field  than that of the exploratory community-based center it had been up to then?
