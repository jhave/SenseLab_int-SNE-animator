To put it another way,  the laboratory setup always reenters its project of explanatory modeling through the gateway called moment. An event is triggered. However controlled the context, there are  always minor elements considered peripheral to the predominant type, category, or cast  of the context to which the brain state will  be correlated. The  contribution of these active ingredients to the total field  falls out. It is designed-out by the way in which the experimental setup is pre-oriented toward the articulation of a certain kind of result. This is no small thing, because among the ingredients designed-out as “negligible” are a whole panoply of relationalfield  effects, which from the point of view  of the environmental awareness we have been talking about are  absolutely integral to the genesis of the event. The  experimental procedure systematically subtracts them, in order to emphasize the contribution of the brain, to the extent that it can be reduced to the physical.
