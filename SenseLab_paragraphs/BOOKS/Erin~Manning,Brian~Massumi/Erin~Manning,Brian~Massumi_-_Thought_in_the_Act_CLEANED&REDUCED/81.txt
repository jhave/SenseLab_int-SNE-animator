rhythm, history, life
“There is a rhythm of process whereby creation produces natural pulsation, each pulsation forming a natural unit of historic fact.” These “transitions of history exhibit forms of order.” “The essence of life,” however, “is to be found in the frustrations of established order.” Life’s “aim is at novelty of order” (Whitehead 1968,  88). Does  taking comfort qualify as life?  Only if it flickers. Is taking comfort death? Yes, if it stays in place.
