The  focus in Forsythe’s work on the what-if is everywhere present in his  ample arsenal of movement techniques, but it can be felt  particularly keenly in the techniques of cueing and aligning. In moving to cue, Forsythe asks  the dancers to become sensitive, collectively, to how the dance as a whole moves. You cue to the trace of a movement-moving, to its repeatable tendency, yes,  but even more so to the what-if of its emergent evolution. This  means that you dance less into the movement-form as it happened in the past than into the speculative figuring of  movement’s incipient future. Aligning, then, means tuning to the what-if as it commotionally appears, in movement-transition. You move to the trace of a movement coming to a landing, you align to its capacity for transition, to its complex of potential, already-on-its-way. You align to the what-if of a movement’s futurity—the not-quite of its having come into being. If–then necessarily follows. Gravity acts  on the body in movement, moving it to land or flow in relatively habitual ways. But  movement-moving has  been opened up by the what-if to its own variation—to new collective sprays, new combinations, new “flow-matches,” as the company calls  them.
