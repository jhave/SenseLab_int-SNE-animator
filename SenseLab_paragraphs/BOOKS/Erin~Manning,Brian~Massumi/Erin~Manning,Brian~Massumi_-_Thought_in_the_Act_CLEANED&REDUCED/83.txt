“It  is certain that all  bodies whatsoever, though they have no sense, yet they have perception . . . and whether a body be alterant or altered, evermore a perception precedeth operation; for else all bodies would be alike to one another” (Francis Bacon in Whitehead 1967b,  68–69). Bodies whatsoever, “a taking shape of surrounds” (AG 2002, 4). Bodies whatsoever in the any-space-whatever of landing, less  a body as such than a bodyingforth. Bodyings forth as instants of existence, as organisms that person, as architectings of mobility. Bodies whatsoever because they “would be alike to one another.” Whatsoever because in excess, always, of this or that preconstituted body: organisms that person take account, field  forth, apportion out, bodies in the making.
“Any one instance of existence involves the notion of other existences, connected with it and yet  beyond it”  (Whitehead 1968,  7). Bodies in the making not as humans already existing but as perceptions on the cusp of environmentality,  an ecological becoming. “This notion of the environment introduces the notion of ‘more and less,’ and of multiplicity” (Whitehead 1968,  7). Prehending not as perceiving before the world, but as the push-pull of the withness of worlding.
