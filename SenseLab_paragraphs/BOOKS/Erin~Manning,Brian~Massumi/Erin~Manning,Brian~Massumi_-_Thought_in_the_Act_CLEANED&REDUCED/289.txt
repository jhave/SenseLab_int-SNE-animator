This  idea of research-creation as embodying techniques of emergence takes it seriously that a creative art  or  design practice launches concepts in-the-making. These concepts-in-the making are  mobile at the level  of techniques they continue to invent. This  movement is as  speculative (future-event oriented) as it is pragmatic (technique-based practice).
