It is no doubt easier to habitually cross  into a room that itself habitually chunks into chairs and tables, than to begin with the whole-field pattern as  yet unresolved into objects. Rather  than chunking, what occurs on the autistic spectrum of  neurodiversity is an immediate entertainment of modalities of relation. Pattern, an interplay of contrasts, comes before familiar use and describable chunking.
The  neurotypical approach backgrounds this modulation of relational emphases by  subtracting from the emergent environment that which is not immediately suited to its  use.  In  the case  of a dinner party, upon entering a foreign dining room, the neurotypical will  likely align to the entrainments of chair-sittability and table-eatability before even fully noting the checkedness of the field. In another context—painting the kitchen, for instance—chairness will shift automatically to laddering, upsetting any notion that entrainment is unvarying. What is unvarying about entrainment is that it is always emphasis-by-subtraction. In yet another context, say creating an art installation in the kitchen, the affordances of entrainment get  backgrounded. Entertainment takes over, now with a richly textured relational emphasis co-involving field-effects of color, light and surface, pattern and contrast, the whole characterized by  an overall field  quality of airiness or crampiness, convivial freshness or the staleness of familial constriction. The field of immediacy reappears for itself, in its own qualitativerelational terms. It will  sort out one way  or another, but in the moment there always will have been much more.
