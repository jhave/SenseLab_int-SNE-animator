economy happens when exchange-as-attunement loses  its  desirability. The  forgetting that tunes to the anticipatory environment of exchangeability is replaced by the arrow of quantitative value-adding. Reterritorialized on the art institution as annexed to the art market. This dampens the potential of artistic activity to create and participate as a force for modulating  a relational field  as a function of the limit and threshold. The  expressive force of art-work is dulled. It is no longer Kleeâ€™s line. It is an arrow of objective accumulation: it is less force than form. Art too often surrenders its  potential to give  time, to activate forgetting, to create conditions for future thinking and doing, becoming.
