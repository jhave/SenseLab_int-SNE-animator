The status of white in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s color theory closely parallels its  relational operation across Ettinger’s painting series. Goethe defined white as “the fortuitously opaque flash of a pure transparency” (1970, §495, 204).8 Translucid matter; or, pure light. “Light no longer has to do with darkness, but with the transparent, the translucid, and the white” (Deleuze 1986,  93).
