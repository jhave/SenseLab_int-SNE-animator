The painting process moves through a series  of material operations. In the earlier series, the original image is worked photographically. Its working is then rebegun in the operation of the photocopier, by whose xerographic means it loses  its  status as the original. The  repeatability of photocopying  enables the working to rebegin again. The  same image that moved into Autistwork, No. 1 reenters in Eurydice, No. 23. The  faces  and their figures  return, under transformation. Painting operations then take over, in almost as machinic a way as the photographic and xerographic operations the painting process relays. Brushstrokes line across the paper, mounted on canvas. Always right to left,  over and over again. Some of the toner grains are  taken up in the pigment of the oil  paint. Vertical brushstrokes cloud the lines. Fingers trouble the brushstrokes, smudging. The brushstrokes line again, over the top, over and again, with ceaseless, rhythmic persistence, day  after day, year  after year.
