Language and movement meet in the thinking-feeling. In  thinkingfeeling, both are notional in analogous fashion: at the immanent limit of their ownmost centerpoint, wholly and only in their own mode. Each  is a thinking-feeling after its own fashion. It is here, at the extreme point of their incommensurability, that they resonate. Itâ€™s, like,  they mimic each other. They notion to each other, at a distance, in their difference from each other. Each  any-point, as immanent limit, twists around into the middle. In the middle, the immanent limits are in abstract superposition. One, two, one, one-two  one-two, in many a multiple. Gestural, visual, aural, linguistic, in reciprocal transduction. Thinking-feeling is the transversality  of all  planes of experience in the immanent twist. It is, like,  life.  Of the moment.
