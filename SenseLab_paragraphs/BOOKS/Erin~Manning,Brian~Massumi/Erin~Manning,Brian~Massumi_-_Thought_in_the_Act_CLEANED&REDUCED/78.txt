Pulses of Persons
To be is to be had in a flash. “These events are decision-like” (AG 2002, 9). A portion of field potential has been had. The sofa’s holding forth has been taken hold of. Its perceptual activity disappears in the taking of comfort. Seated comfort stands out from the background. It takes the foreground, where it will figure as being the experience. The field is now configured. Its event has  taken form. The  sofa  rests  in the background, patient provider of plush. Agent and patient have separated out. Subject and object. Person and thing. The architectural body has  fielded its potential into personable form. This happens in a flash and “is over in a flash.” No sooner is the form taking decided than it “yields to whatever can come next” (AG 2002, 9). Back into the stream. Taking, yielding; figuring, backgrounding; potential resolved, potential returned; taking place and staying in flux.  Personing pulses with field potential. At each pulse it draws the field’s abundance into a unifying standpoint. That standpoint expresses a decision-like event in the currency of affect: comfort. An affective value is a selective expression. It is a qualitative translation of a modal location.
