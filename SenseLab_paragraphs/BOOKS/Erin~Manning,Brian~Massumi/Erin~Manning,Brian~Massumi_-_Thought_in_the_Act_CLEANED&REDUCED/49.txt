In a pen? “Here I am!  Here  I am!” screams Mukhopadhyay’s pen. I am  in the moment; put the moment in me! Pen  the moment! In  James, the moment is the gateway to a conscious experience of a determinate kind: a pen experience in a world of definite use-value. The pen in fact  double features. It alternates between two roles. Grasp it from the angle of entrainment, from the angle of what it can do—“hold ink, mark paper, obey the guidance of the hand”—and it emerges as a stable physical object as opposed to being a percept. Humor it in the ephemerality of its self-entertainment—in the way it “comes and goes,” self-relating, “continuous with subsequent experiences of  its  having been”—and the pen emerges as a percept. What we call  the cognitive relation is in fact  a pattern of the pen emerging alternately as physical or as percept, across different moments. The  pen can only do this double cognitive duty because “in the first instance,” in the singularity of each and every moment’s come and go,  it was  an indeterminate field-effect: a “bald that” (not yet  a this or that). In this uncertainty of fielding, consciousness is already dawning, but has  not blossomed into a fully formed cognition. The  pen, as Whitehead would say,  is already cognizable, but not yet  finally cognized.
