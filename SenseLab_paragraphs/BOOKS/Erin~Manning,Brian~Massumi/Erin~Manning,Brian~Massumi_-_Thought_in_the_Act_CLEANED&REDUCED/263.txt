Color itself is an emergence falling on this continuum. For  Goethe, color does not emerge from darkness when light is cast  upon a space to illuminate its  contents. Color emerges from colored shadow: from a certain clouded self-relating of light. “Color itself . . . is lumen opacatum [opacified  light]” (Goethe 1970,  §69,  31). “For  Goethe, all  colors are shadows” (Sorensen 2008, 161).
