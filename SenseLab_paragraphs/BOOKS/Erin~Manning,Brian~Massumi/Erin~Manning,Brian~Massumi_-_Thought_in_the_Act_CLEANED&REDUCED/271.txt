What is thought in each painting, and across the series, is “the power to rebegin at every instant, to self-rebegin, and thus to self-confirm in a way  that puts everything at stake again every time” (Deleuze 1986,  115). This  power to rebegin is “the consciousness of choice as steadfast spiritual determination”  (Deleuze 1986,  115). What chooses? Not I, no more—not yet. Each and all chooses, every time, in the retracing-itself of an open processual whole always still  in the durational making. Anti-expressionism: “The subjectivity is never ours, it is time itself, that is, the soul or the spirit, the virtual” (Deleuze 1989,  82–83).
