The  foregoing discussion enables us to specify some of the characteristics of such an alter-economy. It is informal. It is unquantifiable. Its valuations directly concern qualities of life. But the affirmation of qualities of experience refuses to settle around prestige-value. Its process is autonomous in the sense that it is self-propagating. What propagates is an evolving formof-life that partners thought and creative/design practice at the emergent level where they already come co-causally together. This is a polyrhythmic economy of germinal forms attuningâ€”of forces of life finding new collective expression. Emergent life, lived less as value-adding than as a value in itself. Ultimately, the value produced is the process: its very qualitative autonomy.
