The  subtitle of  Generating the  Impossible is “a  potlatch for  researchcreation.” We take our inspiration here from the practice of potlatch of the First Nations peoples of the Pacific Northwest coast, a practice that involves a ceremonial period of feasting followed by a lavish giving away, and sometimes destruction, of goods and property.43 Following Marcel Mauss’s writings as well as those of Georges Bataille and Jacques Derrida, we emphasize that potlatch is a way  of modulating the field  of relation as a function of its limit. What is shared is not so much wealth as the limit-idea of gathering, in a manner that counteracts the stultifying tendencies of community understood in terms of harmony. This  is accomplished through an excess of  objects of  exchange and their destruction. The  excess of  gifts  creates quasi-chaotic conditions nudging harmony toward polyrhythm. The destruction of  the gift  leaves nothing but the having-given. It  focuses the experience on the event of giving and its iterations and modulations.
