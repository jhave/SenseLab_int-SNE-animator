The  color field, for Goethe, emerges as an accident befalling transparency: it is a fortuitous becoming, emerging by degrees in a process of continuing variation. “Between transparency and the opacity of white there exists an infinite number of degrees of cloudiness” (Deleuze 1986, 93). The oppositions between light and dark, white and black, and even illumination and hue, which in traditional color theory are  taken to prestructure the field  of vision, by this account emerge processually from a formative accident of transparency: its departing from itself in a flash, into its own cloudying. Transparency thickens, clouding. The clouding “accumulates.” The accumulating attains white as its “extreme degree” (Goethe 1970, §146–47, 60–61; §494, 204).
