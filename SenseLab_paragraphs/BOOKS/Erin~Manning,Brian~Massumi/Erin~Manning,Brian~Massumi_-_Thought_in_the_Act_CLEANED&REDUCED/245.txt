Return to Monet’s Water Lily Pond. Go beyond the trees and the water lilies  and see  what even the painting itself cannot quite conceive. Feelsee  its  taking-time  across generations.  Feel-see how its  color, white, and vibrational light creates an opening for  resonance that exceeds this or that painting, this or that form of art,  that exceeds even the histories they belong to. “The history of painting comes and goes and in the end doesn’t really matter  much”  (Ettinger 2010). See-feel the work as a force for  the thinking of what, in the making, could not quite have been thought, in a more-than of representation. See the work beyond the notion of what “Monet” as “impressionist” could or  intended to achieve. See the work working in the relational interval of its co-composing with the outside of thought, in the now of artistic exploration. “To  think is to create—there is no other creation—but to create is first  of all to engender ‘thinking’ in thought” (Deleuze 1994:  147). In painting.
