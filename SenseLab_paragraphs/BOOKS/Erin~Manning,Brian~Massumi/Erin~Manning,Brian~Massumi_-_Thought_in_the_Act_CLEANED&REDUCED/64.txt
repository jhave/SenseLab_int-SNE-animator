The  surreptitious appeal by neuroscientists to the total field  is a practical necessity. A correlation between an experiential event and a brain state cannot be established without eliciting  an experiential event from which a brain image can be extracted. Subjects are  shown particular images, or inducted into certain kinds of  activity, or  induced into certain affective orientations. A mapping of brain activity is then extracted from the event by the imaging technology. The  predominant experiential characteristics of  the context from which the image has  been extracted—a visual perception of a certain type, the execution of a particular category of act,  an affective priming of a certain cast—is then set against the brain state. The brain state is construed as the physical/objective/bodily side  of the event, and the predetermined experiential characteristics of the context are construed as the perceptual/subjective/phenomenal side. Nonetheless, however  the correlation is construed philosophically, it tends to be lopsided. The  physical side  tends to be treated as explanatory of the perceptual side. This  reduces the perceptual/subjective/phenomenal to the status of  an epiphenomenon. Even interpretations that tie the two sides  together with a model of emergence cannot escape the explanatory lopsiding inherent in attributing epiphenomenal status to the phenomenal. The  physical/ objective/bodily comes out as more “real.”
