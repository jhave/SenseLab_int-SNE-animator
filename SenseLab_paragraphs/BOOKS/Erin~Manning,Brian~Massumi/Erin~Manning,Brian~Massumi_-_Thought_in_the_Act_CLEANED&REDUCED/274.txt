If white is painting-thinking coming out into its own, the coloring of the process “is affect itself” (Deleuze 1986,  118). “Pure virtuality doubling as the affecting and the affected, ‘self-affection’ as the definition of time” (Deleuze 1989,  83; translation modified). Feeling felt,  thought feeling.
Color is thinking’s affective accompaniment. Its feeling friend.
Painting: thinking-feeling. Not imagining.
“I do not use imagination when painting” (Ettinger 2010).
