This  answer to the question “what is it about a position that makes it a motion?” raises another question. What do  we  see  of what makes a motion? What is predominantly seen is indeed a line of movement: the arm describes a curve. But this visible form of the movement is only a certain salience of the field  of motion. It is but the striking, to the eye,  of a dominant vector. Form is a simplification of the field  occurring between registers, flashing up from their difference to each other. The  visible form of a gesture is a distancing of movement from itself. A movement seen is a visual effect of movement’s envelopment in a larger differential field of different orders, different registers of experience, different keys  of life, rhythmically rolled into the moment, in their difference from each other. Movement in itself, as itself, can only be felt.
The  task  of the dancer on performance night is to make visible what can only be felt.
