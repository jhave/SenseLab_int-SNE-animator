For Goethe, the color field  is a qualitative continuum composed of an infinity of variations, contingently unfolding. A continuum of qualitative variation is best designated by its extreme degree, because it is the extreme degree as pole of attraction that orients the moving continuously through. The  continuum of vision is the continuity of white’s tending toward its own emergence from transparency. Transparency is the degree zero  of vision: pure visibility, itself unseeable, containing nothing but the power of the continuum opaquely departing from it. The  entire continuum can be seen, from the perspective of its last  degree of white, as the continuum of white: the continuum of white’s diverse flashes of opacity self-relating, yielding fortuitous degrees of cloudiness in endless variation, across different unfolding series.
