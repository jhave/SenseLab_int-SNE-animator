Across  the co-composition of  just like  that and somehow, across the threshold of death and its lingering at the edges of life, the refrain returns: as if there was just this one. As-if, as if two could make one. But what if two made three? What-if the two, the one-two of language and movement were  reset, just this way,  into an inexpressible thirdness? What if just like that and somehow were  the cues through which the piece aligned itself, again and again, to the force of its doubling? What if just like  that and somehow were the terms of the workâ€™s limit, the mark of how the work must continuously move through the absolute difference of a vertiginous lingering in expression?
