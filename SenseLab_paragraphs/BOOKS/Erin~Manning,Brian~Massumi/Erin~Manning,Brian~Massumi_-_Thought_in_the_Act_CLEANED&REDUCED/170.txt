as if there  was just this  one. Language interrupts the dancers who, a moment ago,  were  moving together, he drawing circles around her seagull-like movements in a contortion that seems to meet her movement halfway, never touching, always sidling. As if there was just this  one, she, standing to his  left,  now immobilized as though holding her breath. Immobilized in a movement alive in its stillness, a lingering suspension. As-if this were  the only way of moving the text, of speaking the dance. Asif it had to be  language or movement. As-if the relational didnâ€™t already hold them together in disjunction, just this  way.  Superposed, what-if and as-if,  moving together in their difference. Think the superposition as  a flashpoint, felt  as rhythm. Rhythm as the expression of movement and language coming together.
