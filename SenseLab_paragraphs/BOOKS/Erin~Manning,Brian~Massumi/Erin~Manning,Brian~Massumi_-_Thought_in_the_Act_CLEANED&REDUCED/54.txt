“What happens if the position changes, if,  say,  we  close the door?” Portia Iversen asks Mukhopadhyay. “It may disrupt the whole thing, and you may need to start once again,” he responds (Iverson 2006, 238).  The tendency toward objecthood, affordance, and linguistic expression has  to return to the field  and start again from the “bald that” of the moment. The  key  difference between the autistic and the neurotypical is that the neurotypical does not explicitly need to start over at every moment. The  neurotypical always has  at the ready a kind of experiential shorthand with which to abridge the event: habit. The  neurotypical has  at the ready a procedure for reconstituting something after the fact  from the phases of experience’s fielding whose immediate entertainment was skipped: the procedure of reflective consciousness. The  shortening of experience by habit and its reconstitution by reflection go neurotypically hand in hand with the greatest of fluidity. What falls  out between habit and reflection, leaving  a gap  they work in concert to smooth over with the aid  of language coming from the field  of memory, is the coming alive of the field  of experiential immediacy, in its emergent dance of attention.
