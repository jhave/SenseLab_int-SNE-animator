“All the time shadows had to borrow the colors of the objects on which they would fall,” writes autistic and poet Tito  Mukhopadhyay. “And they colored all objects in one universal color. That color is the color of a shadow, which is a darker color on the borrowed color” (2008, 21). A colored shadowing: an intertwining of fields  of emergent experience not yet  defined as this or that.6  Not defined as this or that, yet their qualities already interact.  The  fields, in their immediacy, play off each other, lending their qualities  to each other, composing a single field  of mutual action, of co-fusion and changing contrast: co-motion. An immediate commotion of qualitative  texturing. A generative holding pattern already moving qualitatively toward an experience in the making. Colored shadow has emerged: a quality  belonging to the compositional field. Not to its  elements, but to the immediacy of their mutual action.
