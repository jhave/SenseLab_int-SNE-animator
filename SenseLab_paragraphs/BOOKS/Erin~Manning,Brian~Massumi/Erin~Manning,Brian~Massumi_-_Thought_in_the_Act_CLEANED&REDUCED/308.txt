Techniques as we understand them do  not depend exclusively on the content of  the practices but move across their respective processes at the site  of their potential multiplication. A dance practice, for  instance, will  emerge across various registers. A movement exploration might co-combine with a  conceptual force—a word, an idea, a  landscape— influenced perhaps by past explorations and changed, probably, all along its  course by  improvisational explorations that connect to the experiment’s technical constraints. Similarly, a philosophical practice may emerge in and across a reading–writing register that cannot be restricted simply to content. Like the dance practice, the philosophical exploration is a technicity in its own right, activated and activating across registers of content and processual invention, moving incessantly between the rigor of denotation and the force of expression. Each  of our events seeks  collectively to find modalities of experimentation that connect practices at the levels of their intensive creative force. This  is done not in order to map them onto one another, or  to evaluate one in terms of  another, but to propose a co-causal thirdness of exploration that can be generative of new modes of practice and inquiry.
