The  lack  of the expected outcome, that 4 + 2 = 6, clearly has  less to do with Mukhopadhyay’s capacity for  reasoning than with a deficiency in entrainment. This  is a “deficiency” only in the sense that the summing up of the field—the subtraction, from the fullness of its complexity, of a particular product that stands out from it—takes more time because the immediate field of experience does not come already oriented for efficacy. The  neurotypical approach is to jump as quickly as possible to the most “reasonable” outcome, the one most easily cross-checkable factually. That this “rationality” is a subtraction from the fielding of a much richer event is rarely acknowledged. The event is too rarely perceived in the more or the less of its sum, in the intensity of its emergent multiplicity.
