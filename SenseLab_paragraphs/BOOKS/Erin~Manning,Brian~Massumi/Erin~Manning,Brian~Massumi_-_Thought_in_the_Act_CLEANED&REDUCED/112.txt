The  question of  dance is: “What is it about a position that made it motion?” (Forsythe 2011, Nov. 10). Answer: the dynamic knot. The  differential gestural nexus. Feel the spray, field  the nexus, form the movement out of  the feeling. Keep  in touch with the forming motion, “chain the sensations rather than the positions” (Forsythe 2011, Nov. 10). Giving up your position and getting in touch with the forming feeling of the motion triggers what Forsythe calls  an “activation”: the field  throws a curve amid a spray (Forsythe 2011,  Nov. 10). Movement’s order is an ordering of formative feeling activation. Making movement concerns this fielding, from the middle, in the gestural milieu, more fundamentally than any notion of form in the completed sense.
