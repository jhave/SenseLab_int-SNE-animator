What is given, Mauss adds, is not inert (1966,  9). What is given is the gift of giving itself, replete with resettings of the conditions for emergence of the field  of relation. Generosity as ritual technique occurs in a field  of relation that cannot be reduced to the giver as individual, or the object as gift,  or even the punctual connection between the two in a particular act of giving. Potlatch is a giving for  the event by the event. It is the setting into motion of a platform for relation that activates the potential for modes of collaboration, pushing exchangeability to its creative limit. In potlatch, giving reorganizes the event-ecology of co-composition.
