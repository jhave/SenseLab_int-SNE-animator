A term was  adopted for  relational technique in its  event-conditioning  role: “enabling constraint.” An  enabling constraint is positive in its dynamic effect, even though it may be limiting in its form/force narrowly considered. Take, for example, an improvised dance movement. The major constraint is the action of gravity on the body. As a cause, gravity is implacable, its  effects entirely predictable. But  add to gravity another order of cause, and in the interaction between the orders of determination something new and unforeseen may emerge. A horizontal movement cutting across the vertical plane of gravity can produce a certain quantum of lift temporarily counteracting gravity’s downward vector. The arc of the jump will  be a collaboration between the action of gravity and the energy and angular momentum of the horizontal movement acting as co-causes. Add to the mix priming of the dancing bodies through techniques for entering into the movement and modulating it on the fly (including techniques of attention and concentration, as well as conceptual orientations) and a third order of co-causality actively enters in. Gravity has  been converted from a limitative constraint to an enabling constraint playing a positive role in the generation of an event favorable to the improvisional emergence of a novel dance movement. This  model of the enabling constraint was adopted for every aspect of the event-generating strategies for Dancing the Virtual and was retained for all subsequent events.
