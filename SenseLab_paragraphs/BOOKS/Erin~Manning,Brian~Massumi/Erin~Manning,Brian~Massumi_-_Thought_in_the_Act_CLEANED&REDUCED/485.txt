The  free  radical was  embodied for  this event by  one member of  the collective, Australian artist Paul  Gazzola. While the free radical’s ultimate role  was  to disentangle itself from individual embodiment and proliferate,  for this first experimentation with the concept, we needed to give the free  radical a presence and operational form, and Paul  was it. But he was not it alone for long. Even before we reached Mekoos, the free radical had radicalized itself through an unexpected multiplication. Suddenly, as if by spontaneous generation, there were  two, or more. Paul  was multiplied by self-appointed free  radicals going by the monikers “Frank” and “FRank.” Or  was  Paul  the F®anks? Nobody seemed to know. The  identity of  the F®anks was unknown, their position uncertain, and their role evolving over a number of online sallies. All anyone knew for sure  was that the operator of  the free  radical had ostensibly proliferated in its  anonymous enthusiasm to play its  assigned role  of “breaking down emergent attunement after it has  just emerged, but before it can stabilize into a self-sustaining harmony that might assert itself as a model.” From the very  outset, then, the figure of the free  radical spontaneously took off  from Paul’s  (or  is it FRank’s  or Frank’s?) embodiment of it, all the better to work as a transversal force for unsettling the collective attunement in the making, preventing it from institutionalizing into a self-perpetuating structure.
