Ettinger paints the field, but is also  painted by  it.  “I allow [the paintings] to paint me” (Ettinger 2010). In this transformation, the artist herself is transformed. She is eye, hand, body, but she is also movement, tendency, thought, feeling. She  moves-with the transformation, at pains to find an unspoken language—a language of traces, of vibrations and resonances—to articulate what cannot quite be seen, what remains, always, to some extent not only ineffable, but essentially imperceptible.
If it could be said, it would not have to be painted. For Bracha Ettinger is also  a writer.
