The dance of attention evoked here by Mukhopadhyay is the attentiveness in the environment of an expressibility tending toward a determinate expression yet to come. Caught in the middling of this event, Mukhopadhyay is not the maker of the scene. He attends to its dance, co-composing with it.  “I would see that the moment I put my  shadow above the flowers, the story would immediately stop forming” (2008, 22).  The  moment he overshadows the field, imposing his  presence on it,  its  activity stops. Mukhopadhyay must remain co-present. Flower, shadow, story field-dance to attention, in an indetermination of a coming to be determined, at the very  boundary between experiencing and imagining, in the moment, yet untold.
