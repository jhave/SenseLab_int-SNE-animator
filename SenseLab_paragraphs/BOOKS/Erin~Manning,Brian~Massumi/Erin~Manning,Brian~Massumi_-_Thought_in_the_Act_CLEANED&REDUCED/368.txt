Generating the Impossible proposes to intervene directly at the level  of generative tendencies, in such a way  as to render them palpably retrievable  for  new research-creation events. Tendencies are  as  singular as  an event’s generative force, their “pure and simple line” resolutely connected to their eventful coming-to-expression in a specific time and place. They can be iteratively reactivated, to variable effect. We  are  not proposing to model what research-creation events can be. Instead, through the technicity of singular tendings, we are collectively, eventfully, setting into motion a metamodeling of emergence.
