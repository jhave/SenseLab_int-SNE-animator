Experience’s variety does not preclude the efficacy of use; it includes it differently. Take  Mukhopadhyay’s experience of  the door. He  writes, “The color comes and then the shape and then the size, the whole thing needs time to get integrated. To be described as a door, there is position, the open or closed” (in  Iversen 2006, 237). When Mukhopadhyay sees  the “door” he does not immediately see a threshold for passage, as a neurotypical person might. He sees qualities in a texture of integral experience. Color fields first,  and from that interplay, shape asserts itself. Here  I am!  Then with shape comes size. This  relay of emergence is now ready to be described as a door. Only now does it have position, only now does it afford passage. As it becomes determinate, an object form separates out from the dynamic form, an affordance opens, and the tendency for  describing makes itself felt, tuning to language. The field has pressed on toward expressing itself in language. The  field  of emergence is ready to tell  its story. Mukhopadhyay does see the door, and its doorness does allow it to function for  crossing through, and this affordance is expressible in language. But it all takes time. It takes time for the field  of experience to actively sort itself out toward its coming to determinate expression.
