There are also  informal economies. These revolve around assessments of value that are  directly qualitative in nature, and therefore vaguer and less easily indexed. One form of this kind of valuation is prestige-value. A formal economy also  generates its  own prestige-value as a spin-off of its quantitative valuations, or it captures prestige-value produced by informal economies it taps into and annexes to itself. The  most typical contemporary  form of prestige-value is star-value or celebrity-value.
