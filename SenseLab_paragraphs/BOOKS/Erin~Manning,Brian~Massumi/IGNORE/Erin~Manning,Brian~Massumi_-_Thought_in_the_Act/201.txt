Throughout Housing the Body, Dressing the Environment, as was the case in Dancing the Virtual, we were (sometimes painfully) aware that all explo- rations at the edge of inquiry risk failure. Certain platforms for relation didn’t take off, or even collapsed, their attractive force failing to fi the conditions for relational emergence in the given context. When that hap- pened, either they dissipated entirely or elements of the platform com- bined with another. “Failure,” processually speaking, added a fi	and fusional dimension to the event that was not preplanned. From this point of view, failure was generative, a positive formative factor in the event’s self- organizing. A case in point was a regrouping that occurred on the last day of the “Around Architecture” platform that took a turn toward the outside of the event.28 The group improvised procedures to collectively explore the juncture between architecture and urbanism, in this case the SAT build- ing and its surrounding neighborhood.
Failures, for the SenseLab, have come to be thought of as opportunities for the emergence of new techniques of experimentation: they push the collective toward an engagement with the limit of what can be thought/ created in a particular context. Techniques of relation access their creative potential most when they operate at the edge of what they are preconceived to do. For this to happen, they must embrace the eventuality of their own failure as a creative factor in their process.
