I would probably walk into the room and see “check patterns” before even being able to identify the door as a door and the tablecloth as a tablecloth! [. . .] The process of “resolving pat- terns and shapes and forms into familiar objects” is actually a semi-conscious one for me. [. . .] I often tend to sit on fl   and other surfaces even if furniture is available, because it’s a lot easier to identify “fl    surface a person can sit on” than it is to sort the environment into chunks like “couch,” “chair,” “fl	,” and “coffee table.” [. . .] There is much more. There is always more. (2008)17
