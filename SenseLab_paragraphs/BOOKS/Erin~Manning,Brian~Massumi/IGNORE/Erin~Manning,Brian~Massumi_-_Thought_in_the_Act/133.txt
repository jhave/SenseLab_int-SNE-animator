A book with Claude Monet’s Water Lily Pond lies open on a wooden bench a meter or so away from Ettinger’s canvas. “A friend,” she calls the image. Beside the Monet, another book with Leonardo da Vinci’s St. John the Bap- tist also lies open. On the wall above—one of only two, as the space is open to the outside on one end and continuous with the rest of the house on the other—there are four or fi earlier paintings, not a consistent num- ber: they will get taken down, be replaced, repainted even. There are also two easels, sometimes holding multiple paintings, each in progress. And notebooks with their own complex mix of words and images.
On two sides, the house opens to the outside, its architecture extended by a wraparound patio. Seated on a chair between the two easels at the very threshold where the inside meets the outside, Ettinger paints.
