predefi objects nor overshadowing subjects have yet to be singled out; they are alerting us as well to the intricacies of perception across the spec- trum. For neurotypicals are in fact neurodiverse, also immediately perceiv- ing relation. The difference is the speed of subtraction of objects from the total fi   owing to the fi    s pre-perfusion with entrainment. Under cer- tain circumstances, neurotypicals themselves experience a predominance of environmental awareness. It is rarely focused on, though, appearing as an ephemeral interlude between more substantial-feeling affordances. When environmental awareness does resurface, it is without fully bloomed objects and overshadowing subjects, as autistics describe. But there is still a degree of difference between this and other modes of existence on the wider spectrum of neurodiversity. Because entrainment reigns as an imme- diate tendency in neurotypicals, even when they are immersed in a self- entertaining relational fi affordances already agitate, but are not yet objectifi   For the neurotypical standing in a grassy farmerâ€™s fi    paint- ing a fl       , the fl	of experience may immediately present itself for artistic rendering, as it does for autistics.
