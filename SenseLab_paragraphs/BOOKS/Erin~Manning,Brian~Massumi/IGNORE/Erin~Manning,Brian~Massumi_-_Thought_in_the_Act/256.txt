As long as the limit is not reached, it plays a positive role as a creative factor in the process at whose margin it lies. Emergent attunement depends on the invention of conditions to create directly qualitative relational limits. These immanent limits are not unlike the “terminus” in William James’s sense (the concept that fi	so prominently in Dancing the Vir- tual). Immanent limits only function if they actively invent modalities of forgetting.
The ability of the in-folded limit to co-cause always another iteration makes it a form in which the process feeds inventively off its own excess in spiraling eternal return: always more than one. The relationship thrives on productively metabolizing its own excess. It thrives on the strange asym- metry of a terminus that twists into the core of the process, and becomes a generative factor in its every rebeginning. The entire relationship, as a form of life—with its singular lived quality, its unique affective economy—is gen- eratively infl   as a function of the limit never reached at every moment. Until it is. The terminus is not a point of arrival marking an external limit. It is a point of perpetual redeparture, and occasional beginning anew. The limit belongs to the event’s fi of emergence, which the event process carries with it across its iterations. It is part and parcel of what potentiates the process’s power to self-continue: its relationability.
Generating the Impossible proposes, as a research-creation experiment, to collectively co-compose what a directly qualitative, relational economy of art might be. This involves immanently activating the limit beyond which the gallery explodes. Beyond the limit, what threshold lies?
