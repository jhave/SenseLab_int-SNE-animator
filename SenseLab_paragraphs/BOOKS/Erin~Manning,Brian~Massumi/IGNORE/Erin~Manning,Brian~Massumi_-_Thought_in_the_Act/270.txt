A second level of organization was set up to cut across the affi group structure. Each participant was placed in a living situation at Mekoos (a cabin) mixing members from different affi	groups. This was done to create a framework for informal sharing of affi		group-based expe- riences and exploration. It was also intended to counter any tendency for the affi	groups to develop into in-groups identifying themselves against the group as a whole. The hope was that this system of cross- solidarities would not only facilitate concept and technique contagion, but would also produce crossovers between groups that would create the con- ditions for emergent constellations preventing the organizational structure from ossifying into rigid segmentations.
Food preparation has been an important part of all SenseLab events. For Generating the Impossible, it played an even more central role because of the convivial way it cut transversally across the levels of organization, both cabin based and affi group based. This transversality occurred because, practically, each evening meal had to be prepared in a given cabin. This meant that each participant would spend signifi        amounts of time as a guest in another cabin, and would host others in their home cabin. This created a bridge of hospitality between the cabin and the affi group structures. Food preparation was complex (think only of taking allergies and other food requirements of fi four people into account). Each meal comprised at least three courses, and affi groups invested their creative energies into making them artful and generative for the event as a whole. Meals took at least a few hours to prepare (a full day for one affi  group!). This meant that people would be moving in and out of activities of different kinds, threading the food preparation into an active weave of the day. In the care and effort taken to feed the group, an event-wide hospitality could be felt that suffused each aspect of the everyday. Hospitality, practiced in this way, produces an ethos of care, for the event, in the event. Pounds of couscous, spaghetti squash, mangoes, and Persian rice were added to the arsenal of concepts, as food preparation became an avenue for experiences to be shared, ideas to be explored, and concepts to be artistically staged. Eventfully deployed, food sharing can foster emergent forms of sociality constituting qualitative alter-economies of differentially shared experience. We were fortunate that among our participating artists was one with expe- rience as a chef. Andrew Goodman was invaluable in the intensive role of food consultant and meal-planning facilitator.
