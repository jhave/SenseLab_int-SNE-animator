A tendency, metamodeled, is an incipient assemblage (a platform for relation).38 The question of an assemblage emerging into occurrent attune- ment is, as always, a question of technique, as both Deleuze and Guattari and Whitehead emphasize. “The right chaos, and the right vagueness, are jointly required for any effective harmony” (Whitehead 1978, 112). For Generating the Impossible, the quasi-chaotic initial conditions for emer- gence include not only the specifi contents brought by participants, and not only the plurality of generic forms in which they might be exhibited. They also include the accumulated techniques of relation experimentally assembled in past events. For Generating the Impossible, the presence of past participants will prepopulate the event’s emergence with collectively acquired tendencies vying for the opportunity to metamodel themselves in a new iteration under very different conditions than in earlier events.
The gesture of beginning this iteration from quasi-chaos with a min- imum of conditioning extends the metamodeling of generative collabo- rative practices to fi of activity where the number and nature of the variables potentially entering into play are greater and even more unpre- dictable. It’s time to let them loose on the world at large.
