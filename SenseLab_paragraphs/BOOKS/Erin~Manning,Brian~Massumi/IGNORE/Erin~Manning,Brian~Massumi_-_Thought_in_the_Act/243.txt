a lived economy of qualities of experience
The foregoing discussion enables us to specify some of the characteristics of such an alter-economy. It is informal. It is unquantifi	Its valuations directly concern qualities of life. But the affi	of qualities of experi- ence refuses to settle around prestige-value. Its process is autonomous in the sense that it is self-propagating. What propagates is an evolving form- of-life that partners thought and creative/design practice at the emergent level where they already come co-causally together. This is a polyrhythmic economy of germinal forms attuning—of forces of life fi	new collective expression. Emergent life, lived less as value-adding than as a value in itself. Ultimately, the value produced is the process: its very qualitative autonomy. The polyrhythmic heterogeneity of the creative co-factors entering this economy’s composition retain their individual resonant tenor as sub- processes in their own right, even as they enter into dynamic relations of attunement. They attune through the research-creation process, without
