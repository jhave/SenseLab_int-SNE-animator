Derrida suggests that the reorienting accomplished by the gift of giving— the fi	of the future in the passing present of giving itself—must entail an active forgetting, a Nietzschean radical undermining of time as mem- ory of a present past (Derrida 1992, 16). As Nietzsche writes, “Forgetting is not simply a kind of inertia, as superfi minds tend to believe, but rather the active faculty to . . . provide some silence . . . to make place for the new . . . those are the uses for what I have called an active forgetting” (1969, 57–58). A gift economy orients time in an active forgetting of the object and exchange as such.
