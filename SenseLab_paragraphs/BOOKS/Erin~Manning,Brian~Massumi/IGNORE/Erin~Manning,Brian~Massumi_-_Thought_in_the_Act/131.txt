herself again, still not there in no more defi	a way than the painting process will complete itself.
The series comprise a never defi	completed whole, which enters nevertheless as a whole into each painting, as its formative movement across.
It is precisely in terms of the intensive feeling of an open relational whole that Gilles Deleuze defi	the spiritual. The forces entering the fi	of painting that transduce as vibrations are spiritual forces: forces of thought. Thought forcefully felt. A thinking-feeling arising from the mate- rial dynamic of the painting process but in resonant/vibratory excess of its hour, and of the metric time of any of its determinate elements’ enduring. “The paintings contain duration” (Ettinger 2010). They do not contain faces and fi		in time. They contain time, in the trace-forming of faces and fi	appearing-disappearing through connective resonation and in
self-relating vibration.
The time of the painter’s I-not-yet-again is the content of the paint- ing process.
I-not (yet again): non-I.
What fi the painting process is the time-fi of the painter’s non-I, moving nowhere else than in the intensity of a thinking-feeling open-whole.
