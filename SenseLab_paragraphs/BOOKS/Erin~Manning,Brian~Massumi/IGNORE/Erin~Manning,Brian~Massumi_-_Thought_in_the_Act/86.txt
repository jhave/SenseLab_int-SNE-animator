In 2001, the Forsythe Company created Woolf Phrase,1 a piece conceived from Virginia Woolf’s novel Mrs Dalloway, generated, as Forsythe says, by “moving around the rhythm of Woolf’s language” (Sulcas 2001). From its conception, the piece is about movement and language coming together and in relay. Its project: to make a movement phrase of the movement of Woolf’s phraseology.
The piece begins and ends in a recurrent circling that asks us to encoun- ter how language opens itself to movement and how movement co- composes with this opening. Refrains return again and again: “just like that,” “somehow,” “all of a sudden,” “PAAF!” as the piece circles the twist- ing of bodies around the mewling of a sea gull, the barking of dogs, the buzzing of bees, the surging of waves. These refrains haunt the piece, and echo beyond it. When we would leave the rehearsals, they would follow us. We would fi    ourselves reperforming what we had just participated in as spectators. At any moment, we would catch ourselves parsing our actions and comments with a just like that. PAAF! We would sound to a hand gesture recurring from the dance, punctuating the passage from this moment to the next.
What is it, in a work of dance, that gives it this capacity to linger, to reactivate itself, contagiously, beyond its own duration? What is it, in the techniques mobilized by the Forsythe Company, that is capable of agitating language to the limit so that it begins to move, movement recip- rocating by taking on the infl	of language?
Here we take up the refrain again, hoping to restage the contagion in writing.
