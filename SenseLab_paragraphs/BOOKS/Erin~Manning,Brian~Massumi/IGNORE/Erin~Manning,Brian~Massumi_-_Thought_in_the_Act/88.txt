At word’s end, suspended by the rising sound surround in the midair of the dance’s rhythmic milieu, he falls. What is composed, at this moment in the piece, is the tension between the rising and the falling, language and gesture: their differential coming together. Just like that is not a comparison between the contrastive aspects. It is the difference staged, directly sensed. Just like this—feeling, like at no other moment. Like just this moment’s felt intensity.
The piece will be made of these differentials, these tensions, these con- trastive intensities of the moment, on every register, as what happens on one also rhythmically accrues to the others. The composition will jump from gesture to wording, and back again, forever circling, swaddling feeling. Movement will cut into the wording, speaking will interrupt the moving. At times they will coincide. Cut in, cut out, fold around and together. Rising, falling, resonating, just like this, just like that, disjunct, rolling in difference together.
“The sparrows fl	rising, and falling in jagged fountains were part of the pattern; the white and blue, barred with black branches. Sounds made harmonies . . . the spaces between them were as signifi as the sounds” (Woolf 1992, 24).4
