second one and a second three. . . . The count gets vague because move- ment is always in rolling numerical excess over itself. The “thirdness” of all movement: the sea of motion-traces enveloped in the any-point in relation to which dancing dances.13
Movement is not sensorimotor. It is motional-relational.14
The motional-relational is in the speculative mode of the what-if. What-if the bodying, in its thirdness, folds now, extremely fast, too fast for any subject to think it? What-if one, two, fi bodies do this at once? What-if? The what-if is moving thinking itself out, in an uncommon inten- sity of feeling.
