Modal location
Perhaps it is simply too early to make a concrete distinction between alterant and altered, affecting and affected-by. For the underlying activity is a push that pulls. The body is pushed into a taking-account already in process, and this pulls it toward a self-individualizing realization. Not yet one or the other, agent or patient, the body is fi	itself in an undisen- tangleable “interlocking of modes” (Whitehead 1967b, 70). Bare activity.2 Every site is a prehensive interlocking of reciprocal modes in bare activ- ity. There is no “simple location” (Whitehead 1967b, 69–71). The smile spreads over the face, as the face fi itself onto the smile (Whitehead 1967b, 71). The couch fi itself to the body, as the body spreads itself over the couch. The fi is already apportioning this double potential the instant the couch is perceived, even at an uncomfortable distance. In the underly- ing activity of every perception, there is one two-way movement of recip- rocal interfusion already incipiently, actively taking account. “Our body penetrates the sofa on which it sits; and the sofa penetrates our body” (Boccioni 1970, 28). “What emanates from bodies and what emanates from architectural surrounds intermix” (AG 2002, 61). A modal location is a fi    of experience.
