also singularly inventive of new forms of relation, then despite this com- plicity there are emergent forms of life always on the make that might come to assert greater autonomy. The result can be leakage in the system—lines of fl   toward a noncapitalist future. Lines of fl    are immanent cri- tiques of capitalism in action.
The Technologies of Lived Abstraction event series was always destined to co-compose with, and around, capitalist capture, to invent new lines of fl or reinforce existing ones, for a lived glimpse of a noncapitalist economy. This is why we started the present discussion with an evoca- tion of the neoliberal economic context. The SenseLab’s Technologies of Lived Abstraction event series was always under an immanent imperative to return explicitly to the problem of economies. This was done from the start by deemphasizing the product in favor of experimentation with col- laborative creative process as a value in itself. Ultimately, the “impossibil- ity” that is the aim of its culminating event is to contribute, in however small and faltering a way, to metamodeling a noncapitalist alter-economy of creative relation.
