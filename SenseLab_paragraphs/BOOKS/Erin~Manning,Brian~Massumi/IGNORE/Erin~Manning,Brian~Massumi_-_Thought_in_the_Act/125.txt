Move by light
Faces. They come and go. They drift, resizing themselves as they shift. At times, they separate from the fi	supporting them. The fi	also come and go. They multiply forth, no sooner to recede. Vicissitudes of face and fi  move through the painting series, in ephemeral community. Their restless movement is not governed by the principles of portraiture, nor by those of fi	in any traditional sense. Bracha Ettinger says of her paintings that they “have their own formative axis that goes through the painting process” (2010). That axis, she explains, is light. The faces and fi	that come and go move by light.
“The viewer does not have the axis.” The paintings are “not conditioned by the viewer” (Ettinger 2010). This can only mean that the light in ques- tion is not a light of illumination. It is not a light cast upon a scene from an outside source to disclose its contents, as at the fl    of a switch.
Yet the process does start with the fl of a switch. In the Eurydice series (1992–2007), the switch was the on button of a photocopier.1 A found image was consigned to the machine. The machine’s role was to give the already-there of the found image a new beginning. This was done by stop- ping the copying midrun, before the toner had completely set. Unset- tled grains were left in chance-swept motion, setting the stilled contours of the image to drift. This machinic reinstilling of movement dispossessed the found image of its status as an origin, distancing the painting process from the touchstone of the photo’s recognized content.2 The image rebe- gins, in a play of light interacting not with a viewer, but with the electric charges of the toner particles and the drum. Interacting not perceptually, but machinically and materially, outside the traditional painterly domain.
