This book runs interference. Its goal is to open philosophy to its outside, to challenge philosophy to compose with concepts already on their way in another mode, in the mode of artistic practice, in the mode of event- formation, of activism, of dance, even of everyday perception. It writes into this difference, composing across the breach between philosophy and art, philosophy and dance, writing and painting, speaking and moving.
Philosophy’s outside is a generative environment. Philosophy does not yet know how to speak. Its thinking is active, uneasy because always in the encounter. Giving words to the encounter is what we have attempted to do here. Not to solve the riddle of how art and philosophy, activism and philosophy, move together, but to ask ourselves what writing can do to make thought-felt what art can do, with philosophy.
Every practice is a mode of thought, already in the act. To dance: a thinking in movement. To paint: a thinking through color. To perceive in the everyday: a thinking of the world’s varied ways of affording itself. In each of these cases, and the others encountered in this book, the prac- tice in question will be construed as a mode of thought creatively in the act. The practice that is philosophy has no exclusive claim to thought or the composition of concepts. Like every practice, its only claim is to its own techniques. For us, the techniques of philosophy are writing techniques.
