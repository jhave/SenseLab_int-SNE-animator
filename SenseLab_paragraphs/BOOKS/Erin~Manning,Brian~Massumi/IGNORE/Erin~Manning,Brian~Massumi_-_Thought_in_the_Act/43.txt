I was wondering why the hell that 4 had to interact with the number 2, through a + sign. [. . .] I looked at the number 2, won- dering about the coordinate axes of the plane surface and the probable coordinate points that 2 would hold. And as I saw the position of 2 somewhere on the upper side of the page, I men- tally assigned it with the coordinate points of 3 and 7. Three as the x coordinate and 7 as the y coordinate. I could see the page divided into graphic grids. I heard my aide saying something like I needed to fi up my work. But I was busy assigning a coordinate value to 4. Finally, I settled with the values of 3 and 9 as x and y coordinates. I gave a quick value to the addition sign also. Then I found a whole story of number characters other than merely 2 and 4, competing, quarreling, and assert- ing themselves to be written down. Finally, I needed the help of “average.” I took the average on the x side and the average on the y side to bring peace among the numbers. (2008, 154–55)
