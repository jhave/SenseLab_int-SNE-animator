done our work, or is there still work to do? Or: have we done our work so well that we risk becoming the institution we never wanted? How do we proceed from here? Reinvent or perish.
It is part of the SenseLab’s basically anarchist inspiration to consider that no grouping should endeavor to exist indefi    , institutionalizing itself around its own desire for self-perpetuation. At the same time, we realize that no organization will ever be able to completely resist or forego institutionalization. Manning was asking the group whether we had now reached the end of the road, or whether the SenseLab was on the road to becoming an institution in spite of itself. After a moment of shocked silence, the answer came as a resounding no. There was still work remain- ing to be done and a collective desire to embark upon it. Yet the question did stage a performative shift: saying no to the question was tantamount to affi	a collective responsibility for where the SenseLab would move next. The eventual form this desire took was the next SenseLab event, Into the Midst (play on The Mi(d)st intended), which brought us back to the SAT more than a year later in October 2012. Into the Midst was to prove to be the most integrally self-organizing SenseLab event thus far.9 The real gift to the event was the investment participants made to continue “generat- ing the impossible.”
