The great United States of America is breathtakingly not free. Equality is not as sacred because not everyone has access to it. Freedom is not as available as many people think. First, free people treat my people, very smart people who type to commu- nicate, as mindless. Second, they underestimate us as very bad instead of reaching out to us. The creators of everyoneâ€™s very important Declaration of Independence wasted their breath. (Ralph Savarese 2007, 417)
