art market, the tie-ins to the global neoliberal information economy and the local culture-industries economy analyzed earlier. But the “exploded gallery” qualifi this fi “marginally”: at its limit. This raises for art the question of the alcoholic: what artistic iteration might be the last “glass”? If that limit is reached and a threshold crossed, what necessary rebeginning lies beyond? What new abstinent intoxication of life awaits?
The aim of Generating the Impossible is to catalyze a collective mar- ginalist experiment in artistic activity, fl	with the limit of art’s rela- tional fi       making felt the threshold that vibrates with it. What fi
of relation might be expected to lie beyond the threshold? For us, there is only one answer: the political. Generating the Impossible is an exercise in the potential becoming-political of art, beyond its limit. To the extent that the approaching of the limit succeeds in enacting a concertedly qual- itative economy, one that is self-affi	as a polyrhythmic form of life, the politics foretokened will be effectively anticapitalist.
