This pen is . . . in the fi instance, a bald that [. . .] To get classed either as a physical pen or as someone’s percept of a pen, it must assume a function. . . . So far as in that world it is a stable feature, holds ink, marks paper and obeys the guidance of the hand, it is a physical pen. [. . .] So far as it is instable . . . coming and going with the movements of my eyes, altering with what I call my fancy, continuous with subsequent experi- ences of its “having been” (in the past tense), it is the percept of a pen in my mind. Those peculiarities are what we mean by being “conscious” in a pen. (1996, 123–24)
