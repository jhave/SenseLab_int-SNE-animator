vibrational light creates an opening for resonance that exceeds this or that painting, this or that form of art, that exceeds even the histories they belong to. “The history of painting comes and goes and in the end doesn’t really matter much” (Ettinger 2010). See-feel the work as a force for the thinking of what, in the making, could not quite have been thought, in a more-than of representation. See the work beyond the notion of what “Monet” as “impressionist” could or intended to achieve. See the work working in the relational interval of its co-composing with the outside of thought, in the now of artistic exploration. “To think is to create—there is no other creation—but to create is fi of all to engender ‘thinking’ in thought” (Deleuze 1994: 147). In painting.
Now turn to da Vinci and take note that friends do not necessarily resemble one another. In St. John the Baptist, it is more diffi to over- look the form, the fi     the face. How could this salient fi      in Etting- er’s incessant disappearing of the fi	But look again. Note where the fi is placed on the canvas. In fact, St. John the Baptist is not in the center. The background occupies the center. Note how the fi     frames the background, the head to the left and the fi        to the right. What is it framing? It is framing the intensely unseen, or with-seen of the back- ground foregrounding. Caught in this vibration, the fi is no doubt as much light as form or face.
Now turn to Ettinger’s No Title Yet, No. 1—St. John the Baptist and note that the friend is never represented, its tendencies never absorbed into a form or a fi The friend remains a force for thought. And yet there are contiguities, if you approach the works in the register of thinking-feeling. Note the tremulous foregrounding-backgrounding in this image and espe- cially how the white is never fully a presence or simply an absence, how it mists, how it moves, a shivering that comes forth, a shivering attuned, perhaps, to the force of the foregrounding of the background in Da Vin- ci’s painting, a force less fi	than intensive, less form than mobility. The intercessor: a vibratory intensity, felt-thought, that refuses to let the work stand still.
What cannot stand still in Ettinger’s work is not simply fi       or form. It is the line: line becoming fi	indiscernible. Reduce yourself “to an abstract line, a trait, in order to fi [a] zone of indiscernibility with other traits” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 280). “Distance—The tree of this green, the face of these lines” (Ettinger 1993, 9).
