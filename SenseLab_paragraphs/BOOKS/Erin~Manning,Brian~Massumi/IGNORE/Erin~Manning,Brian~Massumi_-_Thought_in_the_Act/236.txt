conversation includes an infi   of factors, other than language narrowly defi      Its cresting in language makes it a speech event, and yet it carries in germ an infi       of other incipient event species.
However the fi of relational co-composition crests—be it in language, through art, in movement, in politics—it will do so in an emergent attun- ing. In Generating the Impossible, we hope to make that attunement take central stage toward the register of the politico-aesthetic event. Whatever the register, what counts is the activation of a heterogeneous fi of poly- rhythmic expressibility toward a next determinate event of expression. What is being attuned, in the fi analysis, is not only the individuals involved, to each other. More fundamentally, it is the quasi-chaos of the initial conditions that is attuning itself to the singularity of the coming event of co-composition. What transpires cannot be credited to the individ- uals as such. The event credits itself with their coming-differently-together.
