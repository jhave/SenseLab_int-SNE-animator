main challenges of the participants’ self-organizing over the two phases of the event.
Metamodelings of generative process are deterritorializing. They move tendentially across institutionalizations and morph them. If the metamod- eling is to avoid becoming a model—a prescriptive template—Generating the Impossible will have to embrace its own perishing, attuned not to dissolv- ing content but to the reactivatable traces of the experiment’s tendential passing. An event of metamodeling must be self-expiring. It must creatively fi ways to affi  its generative power in its passing. The emergent attune- ment cannot be allowed to settle into a simple harmony, where “harmony” is understood as a diversity of parts subordinated to a unifi functioning. We propose an event that is not self-institutionalizing. For these reasons, a mechanism for the perishing of Generating the Impossible will be built into it as an enabling constraint. The technique of relation embodying this enabling constraint is called the “free radical.”
In physiology, a free radical is an unbonded oxygen molecule loose in the body. Free radicals are a natural by-product of the body’s life-sustaining metabolism. But due to their high reactivity, they may also interfere with the body’s regulated functioning by destroying the bonds between mole- cules, releasing still more free radicals. Free radicals possess a “bond disso- ciation energy”: a contagious power of destruction immanent to the very process that ensures organic functioning. The role of the free radical for Generating the Impossible will be to break down the emergent attunement after it has just emerged, but before it can stabilize into a self-sustaining harmony that might assert itself as a model. The free radical is envisioned as a kind of trickster fi that will intervene at the penultimate stage of the event’s emergence, preempting too-unifi an organ-ization. The free rad- ical will infi        the event-space with a joyfully affi	bond dissocia- tion energy. As the contagion spreads, the event will return to the creative quasi-chaos from which it came, leaving only the ripples of its passing.39
