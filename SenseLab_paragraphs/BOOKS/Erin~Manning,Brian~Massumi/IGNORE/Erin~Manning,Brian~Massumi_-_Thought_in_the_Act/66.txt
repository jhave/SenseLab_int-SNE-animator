Taking Account
“There is an apportioning out that can register and an apportioning out that happens more indeterminately” (Arakawa and Gins 2002, 5).1 The apportioning out that can register is sense, meaning “cognition: appre- hension.” The apportioning out that happens more indeterminately is a perception preceding cognitive operation. Apprehension without the “ap-” and with the emphasis on the new fi syllable: prehension. It all begins with an uncognitive taking account of an as-yet-indeterminate apportioning out (Whitehead 1967b, 69). Difference is founded upon this preoperation (“else all bodies would be alike”). A body comes into its own already fi	itself in a difference-making taking-account. As yet it can have no sense whether it is alterant or altered. “Half-abstracted from the start” (AG 2002, 51). And yet it is already in the process of landing. In an “underlying activity of realization individualizing itself” (Whitehead 1967b, 70).
