Distance in proximity. You must stand close: the paintings are small, intricate.
Think-feel the indiscernible in action, the becoming-imperceptible of the I, the trembling of an outside that is never quite there, for the seeing. This is not to say that the fi     is radically excluded. The fi     is there, in act: continuously disappearing. This is the work’s ethos, its politics: attend to the appearing, to the more-than of the disappearance, to the suspen- sion between the two.
The outside is suspended within the work in an appearing-disappearing that beckons to attention. Attending and art-making are aspects of the same process. To bring the non-I in, to paint with friends, is to become attentive to how the friends paint in you. Friends in the third-person sin- gular, impersonal, as in phrases like “it rains”: it greens, it faces, it lines, it lights. The impersonal as the force that attends to a politics in the making, an ephemeral community, to come, that sees beyond the look. “Bending the line so we manage to live upon it, with it: a matter of life and death” (Deleuze 1995, 111).
