The human element alone is not suffi	to account for the fi s activity.

The dynamic form of that co-activity coming toward expression is what Whitehead calls the “subjective form” of the event. In Mukhopadhyay’s account, the moment’s subjective form is as yet unre- solved. It quivers still in the disquiet of the intensely resonant fi The problem of the moment is how the commotion will sort out: which reg- ister of fi effect will stand out, having most forcefully expressed itself vis-à-vis the others. Only once this shakedown occurs will the determinate content of the event be defi       as predominantly a refl		or a convers- ing, a shadowing or a penning.
