a small-group session had to be activated in capsule form for the group as a whole. If language were used for this, it had to be language that was not simply descriptive or denotative, but conveyed a performative force. A concept-working group, for example, might decide to reperform a dis- cussion of a philosophical problem in the form of a movement exercise. We were continually asking ourselves how to create modalities of transi- tion that captured not the content of the last exercise (be it artistic or phil- osophical) but its affective intensity (its generative force). The challenge was to recreate tonalities of experience across modalitiesâ€”to make felt the intensity of thought in practice.
