illumination. The accumulation of transparency that is white is also “the sim- plest, brightest, fi	opaque occupation of space” (Goethe 1970, §147: 61). Space is an emergence, also on the continuum. It emerges in the course of white’s formative self-relating. Next come forms. Light is not shed on preexisting forms. Figures emerge from the shadows variegating the color fi	They do not emerge from the shadows in the sense of appearing for what they already are when shadow is dissipated by a shedding of light. Figures form between regions of shadow. Their contours take at the bound- ary between different degrees of clouding. They are the liminal relation between regions of the formative fi	seen as such. They are relational beings of light—of transparency, translucency, and whiteness—with their own degree of luminous quality. “Between the white of the veil and the white of the background, the face holds itself up like a fi	in the tur- bulent sea of white and color becoming. This fi	“can lose its outline in giving way to a soft focus . . . without losing anything of its refl power” (Deleuze 1986, 93). It can drift, without losing its powers of refl	- ing, its powers of relation.
It is not about “a struggle between light and dark, but light’s adventure with white: . . . anti-Expressionism” (Deleuze 1986, 94).10
