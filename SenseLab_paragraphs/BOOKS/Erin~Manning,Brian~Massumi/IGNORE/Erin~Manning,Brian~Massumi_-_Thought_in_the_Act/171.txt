inaugural initiative in a series of events collectively titled Technologies of Lived Abstraction.18 This fi	event approached the problem from the angle of movement, specifi	the question of what constitutes a “move- ment of thought.”19 The organizing refrain was a formula from philosopher José Gil, who was invited to participate in the event, that “what moves as a body returns as the movement of thought” (Gil 2002, 124). This concept holds that every movement of the body is doubled by a virtual movement- image expressing its abstract form, in its unfolding. The dimension of virtu- ality is at once the movement’s potential for thought and, associated with that, its potential for repetition and variation. Pragmatically, this concept built a self-referential dimension into the event. The event would gather into itself an awareness of its own abstract dimensions, accompanying its every move with a protoconceptualization in action: a thinking fl	with its unfolding that would contribute to the self-piloting of what would happen. The goal was in no way to reach agreement among participants on phil- osophical issues concerning movement, the virtual, and embodiment. The goal, rather, was to stage those issues, live, in the on-site interaction, to see if the interfusion of concept-work and embodied interaction would bring something new to participants’ practices, on the level of their own tech- niques or their techniques for joining their practice with those of others. Actual movement exercises were part of the activities.20 Philosophers were asked to put their thinking into movement, at the same time as dancers/ choreographers were asked to move with their thinking (to mention just the two practices present that were most directly connected to the pivotal
question of the event).
