the extent to which the composing of experience can be reduced to its physical pole. In other words, in the expanded context of the whole-fi approach proposed here, it has limited explanatory value. In the moment, the immediate fi	of experience is self-explaining in the way it complexly plays out, composing a self-expressive outcome for itself. From moment to moment, experience explains itself in the variations on its expressive outcomes. Its self-explaining always starts from qualitative fi	effects, like colored shadow. Its outcomes always have an overall qualitative color, or affective tonality. The fi	of experience is best described as relational- qualitative, not physical or perceptual, or some correlated combination of these. The question of “curing” modes of existence such as autism must be situated on this relational-qualitative ground. It is not just a therapeutic question. It is a question of the diversity of modes of existence, and of the modes of thought they enact, and of the varieties of expressive outcomes they compose, and of the differing determinations of experience those out- comes instantiate in the world. The question of curing is not as direct as it might seem. It is in fact an ecological question concerning how diversities co-inhabit the same fi	of becoming-human and co-compose.22 Perhaps the field can be cured—of the neurotypical devaluing of autistic experience. DJ Savarese, writing in the crushingly overmedicalized United States, polemically makes this point in terms of “freedom,” playing the conven- tional political rhetoric of his country of birth against its tendency toward therapeutic overkill:
