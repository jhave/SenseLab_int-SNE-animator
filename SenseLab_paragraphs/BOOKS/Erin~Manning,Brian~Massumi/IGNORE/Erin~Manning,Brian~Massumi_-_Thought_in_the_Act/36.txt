Fielding and Affordance
“This notion of the environment,” says Whitehead, “introduces the notion of the ‘more and less’, and of multiplicity” (1968, 7). The idea is not sim- ply to turn the tables, and say that neurotypicals suffer from environment- blindness owing to their focus on the human, and on the human-centric use-value that the objectiles active in the environment may be cast for. Neurotypicals also have environmental awareness, “more and less”: more peripheralized, less often attended to in its own right. Conversely, most so- called “low-functioning” autistics are not without language, as the quota- tions in the previous section show, even though many are without spoken language. “Not being able to speak is not the same as not having anything to say,” reads one of the slogans of the Autistic Liberation Front.11 Despite their initial focus on the qualitative relationality of emergent environ- ments, autistics are also capable, more and less, depending on many fac- tors, of perceiving “objectively.” By “objectively” we mean in a mode in which focalized impacts, and their eventual uses and recountings in lan- guage, single themselves out as particular affordances from the fi	of the environment. We call this the mode of entrainment.12
Entrainment in relation to Mukhopadhyay’s fl		fi	would have immediately placed the fl	within an effi		mode such as “pick- ing” or “smelling.” That Mukhopadhyay’s experience is less of the fl  itself than of the fi	of fl		and shadowing and storying does not suggest that he cannot also smell the fl	or eventually differenti- ate it from other affordances. What it suggests is that there is a tendency within autism to immediately perceive the relational quality of a welling
