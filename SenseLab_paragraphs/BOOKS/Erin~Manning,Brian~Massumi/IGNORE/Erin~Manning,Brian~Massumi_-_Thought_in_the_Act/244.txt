limit and threshold
All economies involve exchange. According to Deleuze and Guattari, exchange is only apparently organized according to a principle of equiv- alence that is applied punctually in each act of exchange between two individuals: for example, an equivalence between a good of one kind and another realized punctually in a trade. Exchange is not punctual. It has a serial order that implicates a collectivity. The series of exchanges, Deleuze and Guattari argue, is in fact organized as a function of a limit. The limit is the “idea of the last objects received, or rather receivable, on each side” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 437). “Last” here does not mean “the most recent, nor the fi     but rather the penultimate, the next to the last, the last one before the apparent exchange loses its appeal for the exchangers, or forces them to modify their respective assemblages, to enter another assemblage” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 437). Appeal: the idea of the limit is qualitative. The limit-idea of the next-to-the-last exchange after which the series of exchanges would change intuitively informs each punctual act of trade. Thus there is a qualitative evaluation that underlies each “equiv- alence” produced by a trade and sustains the possibility of the series of exchanges continuing as before. The appeal of sustaining the exchange activity is essentially the desirability of sustaining the way of life associated with the objects exchanged.
Deleuze and Guattari give the example of trading for axes in a tribal society. If the penultimate is passed and the limit actually reached, there will be a surplus of axes. When the surplus is absorbed, a transition will necessarily occur to a new assemblage—a new form of warfare or a new form of agricultural production. An entire way of life will be transformed. The reaching of the limit is the passing of a qualitative threshold to a new collective form of life featuring new kinds of activity. The punctual equiva- lence realized in a given trade between individuals is a function of a qualita- tive evaluation ultimately bearing on a collective form of life. The object of the evaluation is less the thing exchanged than the relational fi     of activ- ity into which the object is inserted. The qualitative evaluation of the limit is the organizing principle of a fi of relation that immanently informs every punctual event belonging to the fi         and sustains them all. What is at stake is less the equivalence between the objects exchanged than the sustenance of their relational fi  of exchangeability, within certain quali- tative parameters. The limit idea is the economic expression of a collective
