of its activity, it is nonconscious by nature. The emphases of conscious experience are, for Whitehead also, predicated on the “elimination” of not-fully-determinate formative activity. Elements of what is eliminated from the central focal region of consciousness persist vaguely in the surrounding “penumbral” region forming the periphery or background from which clear consciousness stands out. The penumbra of consciousness is semiconscious. This semiconscious surround of consciousness makes consciousness, however focused, however eliminative, a variegated fi phe- nomenon. It is the fi	of consciousness that comes out for itself, as a mode of experience in its own right, in what we call “environmental awareness.” Environ- mental awareness is full of entrainment but also exerts a force of entertainment (in Whiteheadian terms, as we interpret them, it is saturated with causal effi    , but also has a degree of presentational immediacy in fusion with it). On consciousness and inhibition of activity, see Bergson (1911, chapter 1). On elimination, see White- head (1978, 187–88 and passim).
