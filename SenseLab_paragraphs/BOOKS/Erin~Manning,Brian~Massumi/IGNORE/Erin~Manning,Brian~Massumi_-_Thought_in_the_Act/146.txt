Photography Xerography scanography
The painting process moves through a series of material operations. In the earlier series, the original image is worked photographically. Its working is then rebegun in the operation of the photocopier, by whose xerographic means it loses its status as the original. The repeatability of photocopy- ing enables the working to rebegin again. The same image that moved into Autistwork, No. 1 reenters in Eurydice, No. 23. The faces and their fi - ures return, under transformation. Painting operations then take over, in almost as machinic a way as the photographic and xerographic operations the painting process relays. Brushstrokes line across the paper, mounted on canvas. Always right to left, over and over again. Some of the toner grains are taken up in the pigment of the oil paint. Vertical brushstrokes cloud the lines. Fingers trouble the brushstrokes, smudging. The brushstrokes line again, over the top, over and again, with ceaseless, rhythmic persistence, day after day, year after year.
