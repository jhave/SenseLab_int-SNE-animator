of perception, emphasizing how experience unfolds through the matrix of qualitative fi    of overlap and emphasis already immediately mov- ing toward expression in a dynamic fi of becoming alive with co- composition. For autistics, language comes late, and it is this that perhaps marks most starkly their difference from neurotypicals. Neurotypical expe- rience tends immediately to align to the beyond of the milieu of relation, to an ulterior phase in which the fl   stands alone, a solitary object sep- arate from its shadow-stories. The separating out of the object backgrounds the intrinsic relationality of the fi s coming to expression, clearing the stage for an overshadowing human subject to cast his presence in its place, in order to take personal credit for the fi s environmentally emergent accounting for itself.10
