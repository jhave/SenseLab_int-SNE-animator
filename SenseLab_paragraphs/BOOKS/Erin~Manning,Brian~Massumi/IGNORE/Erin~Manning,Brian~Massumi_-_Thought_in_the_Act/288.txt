Coming Alive in a World of Texture
1. It is still too common to separate so-called “low-functioning” autistics from high-functioning autistics. Like many on the spectrum, we reject this nomenclature. All autistics function differently, and this functioning has effect on how they excel in a largely neurotypically infl	world. As others within the autism activist com- munity have pointed out, the labels that have become commonplace in autism in many cases only serve to reinforce the assumptions of the neurotypical (or ableist) community.

But that’s because having a bit of relative privilege renders them unaware of the full conse- quences of their actions. They don’t realize that they have things backwards—the more devalued you are, the more you need equality, the more you need to be con- sidered another important part of human diversity, etc. Not the less. And ‘less’ is what aspie supremacy ends up meaning to those of us who (even when we have some very valued skills in a few areas) are more vulnerable to devaluation and all of its effects.
