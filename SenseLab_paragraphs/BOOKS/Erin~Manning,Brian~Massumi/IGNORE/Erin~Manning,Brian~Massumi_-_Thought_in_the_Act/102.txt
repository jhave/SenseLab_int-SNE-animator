The Motional-relational
In what manner is movement induced into furthering itself in the inven- tion of new dynamic forms? The answer is quite simple. Movement only comes from movement. But movement does not come from movement only sequentially, in a rolling continuity of thinking-feeling motionally bodying. Movement is always triggered relationally. That is the answer: movement only comes from movement relationally.
Going extremely fast, as Forsythe suggests, is a key technique for mak- ing movement move. When a body folds in on its own gestures faster than the general speed limit of sensorimotor coordination, it self-generates an infl	of its line of movement. It activates to the extreme, and throws itself a curve, across the regenerative interval of its return to the any-point. You have to go so fast as to “be ahead of yourself” (Forsythe 2011, Nov. 23). “Don’t be adaptive, be predictive” (Forsythe 2011, Nov. 10). That is, be speculative. Feel it coming at the speed of thought.
Even one body alone is dancing relationally. Its movement stands out in its difference against the background of all the other dance movements it potentially might have been. Or—why not?—of all the movements of dance history. One body alone is moving to the traces of movement’s own passing, where it just was, absorbed in tracing where it is going. “Sense motion traces,” Forsythe instructs (2003b, 16). This is what chaining sensa- tions instead of positions is all about. When one, two, multiple bodies are dancing, they are moving in relation to a sea of motion traces enveloped in the any-point. When there is one body alone, its potential makes two. When there are two, it makes three. When there are three, it makes . . . a
