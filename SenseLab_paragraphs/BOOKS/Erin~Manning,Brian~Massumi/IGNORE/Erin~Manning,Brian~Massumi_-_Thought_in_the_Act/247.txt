politico-aesthetic economies of relation
The forms of activity that will co-populate the fi	of relation of Generat- ing the Impossible will be of many kinds, each with its own relational sub- fi	rhythm of event seriation, immanently modulating limit-idea, and threshold to a necessary rebeginning. The enabling constraint of quasi- chaos built into the event will create conditions of interference. How can a philosophical talk and a VJ performance, for example, cohabit the same space and time? What kinds of exchanges will be improvised to make this cohabitation work? How will the heterogeneity of forms of life co- composing the event enter into polyrhythmic “conversation”? What man- ner of attunements will emerge? What modulations? Will some forms of life capture or annex others? Will the forms of life entering the mix fi ways of exchanging limit-ideas so that their relational fi	meld or enter into symbiosis? Will a new limit-idea, never before occurring, emerge from the singular playing out of the polyrhythmic relational fi	of the event? Will the component processes attune to a limit-idea they invent among themselves, across their relation, composing a collective individuation of each and all together?
In a way, a shared limit-idea is already, at least germinally and provi- sionally, provided for the event: the idea of “exploding the gallery.” This idea qualifi    the shared relational fi      of Generating the Impossible as a fi    of art activity, with all that implies: the inevitable complicity with the art market, the forms of monetary value and prestige-value driving the
