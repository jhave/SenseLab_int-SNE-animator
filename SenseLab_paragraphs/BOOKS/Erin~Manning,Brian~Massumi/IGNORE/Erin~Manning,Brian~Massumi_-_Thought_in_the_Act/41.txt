For the neurotypical, the fi comes already sat- urated with affordances the fi  proposes, with openings or object-buds offering themselves as conduits for the fi s coming expression, already oriented effi	. This effi	tendency in neurotypicals lends the fi      more “naturally” to the kind of cross-checking that is for fact- fi	rather than for story-making in a poetic sense, as it was in Muk- hopadhyay’s case. For both neurotypicals and autistics, and all along the spectrum of neurodiversity, it is only beyond the moment, with memory, and with the retellings memory makes possible, that objects will stand out clearly, sagely observing the boundary between experience and imagin- ing. In the moment, they are fused with fi effects that are moving and ephemeral and at the threshold.
