17. The fi   issue of the SenseLab’s online journal was dedicated to the ques- tion of research-creation, with contributions from a number of SenseLab event par- ticipants.

18. Dancing the Virtual,  http://www.dancingthevirtual.blogspot.com.  The call  for  participation  is  available  at  http://senselab.ca/wp2/events/dancing-the
-virtual-2005/. Thirty participants were chosen on the basis of their response to the call, which brought the total to forty, including the core SenseLab committee. Invited participants included those listed at http://senselab.ca/wp2/participants/.
19. On the concept of the movement of thought, see “Conclusion: Propositions for Thought in Motion” (Manning 2009, 213–28).
20. The movement exploration for this event was “relational movement.” For a more detailed exploration of this movement practice, see “Incipient Action: The Dance of the Not-Yet” (Manning 2009, 13–28).
21. Despite the lack of funding, everyone who committed to Dancing the Virtual  attended and, with the exception of two participants, returned for the subsequent event, Housing the Body, Dressing the Environment. Certain eligible components of subsequent events were funded by grants from the SSHRC.
22. We make a distinction between “relationality” and interactivity based on the mode of causality (co-causal and fostering emergence of the new in the fi case, and linear and reproductive of function in the second). On this distinction, see “The Thinking-Feeling of What Happens” (Massumi 2011, 39–86).
23. A Basecamp grouphub was set up for online interaction in advance of the event.
24. On the concept of the terminus, see “The Ether and Your Anger: Toward a Speculative Pragmatism” (Massumi 2011, 29–38).
25. On the need for “sobriety,” see Deleuze and Guattari (1987, 279).
26. See http://senselab.ca/wp2/events/housing-the-body-dressing-the- environment-2007/.
27. The concept was proposed by Owen Chapman, who has continued to work with the “ice xylophone” in his own artwork (http://www.opositive.ca/fi opositive.html).
28. Other platforms included “Into the Night,” “Dancing the Environment,” “Becoming Responsive,” “Fashioning Skins,” and the already mentioned “Around Architecture” and “Sound Surrounds.” There were also three food-related platforms, one organized for each evening.
