activated through the event, and to showcase the inventiveness of the local actions.35
This third iteration of the Technologies of Lived Abstraction event series left a strong collective sense, at least at the SenseLab in Montreal, that it was indeed possible to invent techniques for generating aesthetico-political events across a distributive network with very little central input (beyond the setting in place of a skeletal framework of enabling constraints offering affordances for cross-fertilization). Recognizing the large number of collec- tives of similar inspiration working around the world under such rallying cries as “artivism,” “hacktivism,” “urban art intervention,” and “culture jamming,” there was a sense of participating, in one small way, in a larger process with unbounded potential for further networking and contagion. Society of Molecules also revived the dream of creating a “Process Seed Bank” that might provide the growing culture of this widely distributed ethics of engagement with a repository for sharing “recipes” for the diverse tech- niques of relation that have been put into practice across the world in dif- ferent collective contexts. The SenseLab stakes no claim to originality with respect to these approaches and inventive practices. Its only claim is to par- ticipation in experimentation.
