variations
Experience’s variety does not preclude the effi of use; it includes it dif- ferently. Take Mukhopadhyay’s experience of the door. He writes, “The color comes and then the shape and then the size, the whole thing needs time to get integrated. To be described as a door, there is position, the open or closed” (in Iversen 2006, 237). When Mukhopadhyay sees the “door” he does not immediately see a threshold for passage, as a neurotypical per- son might. He sees qualities in a texture of integral experience. Color fi
fi and from that interplay, shape asserts itself. Here I am! Then with shape comes size. This relay of emergence is now ready to be described as a door. Only now does it have position, only now does it afford passage. As it becomes determinate, an object form separates out from the dynamic form, an affordance opens, and the tendency for describing makes itself felt, tuning to language. The fi has pressed on toward expressing itself in language. The fi of emergence is ready to tell its story. Mukhopadhyay does see the door, and its doorness does allow it to function for crossing through, and this affordance is expressible in language. But it all takes time. It takes time for the fi of experience to actively sort itself out toward its coming to determinate expression.
To a neurotypical, something qualitatively different tends to occur in the same fi Because going through a door is such a habitual experi- ence, the crossing is likely to occur as if automatically, without the inter- play of qualities, their relay, the emergence of door, and the opening of the affordance even registering. Doorness disappears. The door fi	as always-already passed through, habitually. Any description of it will have to be a reconstitution, the event coming toward expression in language from the fi     of memory rather than from the fi     of immediacy. This is
