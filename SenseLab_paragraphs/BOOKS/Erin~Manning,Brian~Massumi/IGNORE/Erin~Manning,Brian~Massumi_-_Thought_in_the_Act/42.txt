When the Field dances
A mode of existence never preexists an event. The sittability of the chair in your offi does not preclude the chair becoming an affordance for sleep. The mode of existence has to do with the emergent quality of the experi- ence, not with the factually cross-checked identity of the objects featuring in it. What is startling about the neurotypical is the capacity to background the in-formation of the field, and to pre-subtract from the expressive poten- tial of its relational complexity. No cartwheels in the classroom.
But what of the classroom? What of our neurotypical children who can- not sit still as they are told how and what to learn? Where is that joy we remember in their perpetually moving and ephemeral four-year-old bod- ies before the classroom took over? What presuppositions exist in the very notion of the neurotypical? The “epidemic” of “attention-defi disorder” rings alarm bells. Might not the diagnoses betray an inattention on the part of adults to an attentiveness of a different order? One mode of existence’s defi    may be another’s fullness.
Take this example of Mukhopadhyay’s. In the context of a classroom much below his intellectual level, he is asked to add 4 + 2. When he is seemingly incapable of following through with the task, the teacher quickly comes to the conclusion that his intellect is defi	assuming that because Mukhopadhyay did not come up with the answer she had expected, he is incapable of carrying through even the simplest of math- ematical equations. Yet listen to how Mukhopadhyay relates the story:
