the generalization that comes with that, but it must be ac- tive enough that the whole conceptual fi	of the work feeds through it. For Dancing the Virtual, the minor concept chosen was “terminus,” found in William James’s work (specifi Essays in Radical Empiricism). “Terminus” is a term that is often overlooked but is integral to the weave of James’s philosophy. It refers to the tendency orienting the unfolding of an event as it senses its potential completion and follows itself to its culmi- nation. The terminus is a forward-driving force that carries an event toward its accomplishment. It is an organizing force ex- erted by the end, from the very beginning, and through every step.24 For the conceptual speed dating, the group is given the term, as well as a passage or page number to start from. At fi minute intervals, the fl	move from one post to another, try- ing to sort out the concept. The force of the exercise plays itself out not only in the working-through of the concept in pairs, but perhaps even more so in the moving-forward to the next pairing, where a discussion takes up again, already infused with the previous conversations. This stages a collective thinking process, as individuals’ ideas disseminate and mutate through continually displaced pairings. In Dancing the Virtual, the conceptual speed dating had a catalytic effect, giving the event a pivot concept around which to unfold.
