What-if
Forsythe asks: “Can ballet actually produce . . . something we don’t know? We’d like to [. . .] investigate what it feels like to speak that way” (2003a). What-if? What-if this épaulement, this singular movement-formation, were turned in on itself, subverting the organization of the organs, of the limbs? What-if the gaze, normally turned askance toward the audience, were turned in, turned back into the head in visual “disfocus” (Forsythe 2000) so that “the body [. . .] becomes an ear, [. . .] an organ for listening” to the rhythmic milieu (Forsythe 2003a)? What-if this extension we call an ara- besque opened less onto a posture or a pose, a completed form, than onto the feeling of a passing balance?
Forsythe’s work builds on the what-if. It is never a question of formally working something out in advance. Speaking of his collaboration with composer Thom Willems, he explains: “He always wants to know what are we thinking and I say nothing, we’re just, we’re just organising bod- ies” (Forsythe 2003a). We are not thinking, the thinking is in the moving. Organizing bodies does not mean placing bodies on the stage and plan- ning them into forms. It means reorganizing the body itself, in its com- motion with other bodies. It means activating collective rhythm on the level of a relational movement, a level on which form does not single out. “When I go into the studio I want to be able to see what is in front of me, I want to not have another idea.” Idea, here, is allied to form. What-if asks another kind of question, a question of technique: “The biggest challenge, is not seeing what I want to see but seeing what’s actually in front of my
eyes” (Forsythe 2003a). A spray.
