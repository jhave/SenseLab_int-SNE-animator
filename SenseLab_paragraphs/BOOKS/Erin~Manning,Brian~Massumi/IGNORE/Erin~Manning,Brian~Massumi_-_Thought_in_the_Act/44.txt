Mukhopadhyay is in the thick of a number fi of experience. Just as color, shadow, and smell were in active interplay in the sunlit fi     numbers are in a commotion of relational activity, each vying to be written down, to be the conduit of the fi     s summing up in a determinate expression.
The lack of the expected outcome, that 4 + 2 = 6, clearly has less to do with Mukhopadhyay’s capacity for reasoning than with a defi	in entrainment. This is a “defi	only in the sense that the summing up of the fi the subtraction, from the fullness of its complexity, of a particular product that stands out from it—takes more time because the immediate fi   of experience does not come already oriented for effi    . The neurotypical approach is to jump as quickly as possible to the most “reasonable” outcome, the one most easily cross-checkable factually. That this “rationality” is a subtraction from the fi	of a much richer event is rarely acknowledged. The event is too rarely perceived in the more or the less of its sum, in the intensity of its emergent multiplicity.
For Mukhopadhyay, mathematics dances to attention in a way that lends it to the relational force of its milieu. All manner of exotic, potential outcomes vie. “What if a 2-dimensional point is added to a 4-dimensional point?” Mukhopadhyay continues. “I saw the fourth time-vector coordi- nate, leading the plane, in a clockwise motion, coming back every twelve hours, in a 360 degree rotation. My day fi      with all the exotic wonders
