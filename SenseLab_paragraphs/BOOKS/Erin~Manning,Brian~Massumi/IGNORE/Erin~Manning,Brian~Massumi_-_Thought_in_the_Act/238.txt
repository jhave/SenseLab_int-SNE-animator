Forms of life
There is a well-worn term for the relational machinery that moves a fi of emergence through its serial expressions, specifi in a way that feeds the outcomes of each self-registering event onto a surface of recording where their comparative value can be assessed in some way. It is economy. In a formal economy, the valuation is quantitative and is derived using con- ventional measures. The formal valuation then feeds back into the fi of emergence, to become an enabling constraint that conditions next expres- sions. Each expression generates an assessable yield, and the yields mutually reinforce (or weaken) each other. The mutual reinforcement or weakening across iterations can itself be quantifi in statistical indexes assessing the “health” of the process.
There are also informal economies. These revolve around assessments of value that are directly qualitative in nature, and therefore vaguer and less easily indexed. One form of this kind of valuation is prestige-value. A formal economy also generates its own prestige-value as a spin-off of its quantitative valuations, or it captures prestige-value produced by informal economies it taps into and annexes to itself. The most typical contempo- rary form of prestige-value is star-value or celebrity-value.
