without shutting down artistic practices that, for example, choose to be provocative in order to focus and stimulate public debate” (quoted in Herland 2010).

9. The closest English equivalent would be the “Culture and Entertainment Dis- trict.” The chief artist for the plan was prominent light designer Axel Morgenthaler (Photonic Dreams, http://www.photonicdreams.com). Many other well-established local artists were also involved in the project. Artists involved in the concept for per- formance halls include Jacques Tessier, Guy Desrochers, Gérard Souvay, Gilles Arpin, Luc Courchesne, Marianne Mercier, Marc-André Boudreau, Nomade Architecture, and Axel Morgenthaler. Many participating artists were chosen through grant-based fund- ing initiates. For the city’s presentation of the lighting plan, see http://ville.montreal

Innovative research around research-creation in Montreal includes Sandeep Bhagwati’s MatraLab (http://matralab.hexagram.ca/matrapeople/sandeep-bhagwati); Sha Xin Wei’s Topological Media Lab (http://topologicalmedialab.net), the network- ing/gaming initiative orchestrated by Lynn Hughes and Geoffrey Rockwell titled iMatter (http://www.humanities.mcmaster.ca/~imatter/), the Université de Montre- al’s Institut Arts Cultures Technologies (http://www.iact.umontreal.ca/site/), Hexa- gram (see note 6), Luc Courchesne’s projects with the SAT (http://courchel.net), Chris Salter’s Lab X Modal (http://xmodal.hexagram.ca), as well as a list too long to mention of artists working on independent projects under the mantle of research- creation. Internationally, among many others, there is Andrew Murphie and Anna Munster’s Dynamic Media project (http://www.dynamicmedia.com).
15. The cynicism often lies under the surface, either taking the form of a rejec- tion of research-creation as a “new turn” (this criticism is accurate: research-creation is a modality of creative practice that has always existed) or taking the form of the reaffi	of the theory–practice divide with an exclusionary emphasis on one side or the other. The point we are trying to emphasize is not that research-creation in itself is a “new” practice, but that we can take this politico-economic juncture as a starting point to redefi how research and creation practice modalities of inter- twinement that give us new ways of conceiving both creative practice and research.
