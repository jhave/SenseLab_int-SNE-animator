not only as part of a practice of event-design, but as part of a larger “eth- ics of engagement.” The techniques would have to be structured, in the sense of being tailored to the singularity of this event, and improvised, taking the desires and expertise of the event’s particular participants into account, inviting their active collusion in determining how the event would transpire, so that in the end it would be as much their event as the organizing collective’s.
The success of Dancing the Virtual would be measured not by any easily presentable product produced during its three-day duration, but by whether there was follow-up on its process afterward: in other words, by whether the event itself had set anything in motion. The follow-up might take various forms: unforeseen cross-practice collaborations initiated at the event, other groupings elsewhere taking up the concept and practice of techniques of relation in the context of research-creation or other hybrid meeting grounds, and increased international networking between groups already working along similar lines. The focus in the creation of techniques of relation was on catalyzing a continuing collective culture dedicated to an ethics of engagement. We wanted to set into motion something that could grow and take us with it. In short, the event would be evaluated according to what it seeded rather than what it harvested.
This orientation made the event largely unfundable by granting agen- cies. The decision was made not to change the nature of the event in order to qualify it for government fi	This meant that if it was to come to pass, it would only be by the will and resourcefulness of its pro- spective participants, its community partners like the SAT, and its Sense- Lab organizing collective.21
