practice of the gift. The host group’s gift of a processual recipe was recipro- cated in the form of a “process seed” brought by the emissary and left with the host group. The seed was sealed and was to be opened only after the event. It could be an object around which a group activity could be orga- nized, or a set of procedures to be followed collectively. The simple default option of this technique of relation was an actual plant seed that would be cared for by the molecule in the period after the event.
The role of the recipe was to create conditions encouraging processual contagion in the lead-up to the event. The role of the seed was to leave a trace of that processual exchange that could be activated in the fol- low-up to the event. The idea was to surround the period of the main dis- tributed event with a longer-duration continuity of relation based on an ethic of care.
The “care” involved was not a personal quality or a private subjective state. It was a collective practice of care: an enactive, technique-based con- cern on the part of each group for the process of another group and for the overall process in which all the groups were implicated. Care was consid- ered an impersonal technique for an ethics of engagement taking a directly political (“diplomatic”) form. It was understood in terms of care for the event (like the event’s hospitality) in which a collectivity was equally but differentially implicated. Everyone was actively together in the event, in each case from a different angle of approach expressing the singularity of a local process networking with others. Collectively singular.
