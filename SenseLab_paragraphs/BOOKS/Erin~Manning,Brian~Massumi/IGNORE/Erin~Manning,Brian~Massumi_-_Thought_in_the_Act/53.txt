yet another variation, in addition to environmental awareness and cogni- tion and their fl	that of refl	consciousness. Refl	conscious- ness is a variation on the neurotypical—underlining the point made earlier that every mode of existence, including the neurotypical, is in fact neuro- diverse, intermodal in its internal composition.
“What happens if the position changes, if, say, we close the door?” Portia Iversen asks Mukhopadhyay. “It may disrupt the whole thing, and you may need to start once again,” he responds (Iverson 2006, 238). The tendency toward objecthood, affordance, and linguistic expression has to return to the fi  and start again from the “bald that” of the moment. The key difference between the autistic and the neurotypical is that the neurotypical does not explicitly need to start over at every moment. The neurotypical always has at the ready a kind of experiential shorthand with which to abridge the event: habit. The neurotypical has at the ready a procedure for reconstituting something after the fact from the phases of experience’s fi	whose immediate entertainment was skipped: the pro- cedure of refl	consciousness. The shortening of experience by habit and its reconstitution by refl	go neurotypically hand in hand with the greatest of fl		. What falls out between habit and refl	leav- ing a gap they work in concert to smooth over with the aid of language coming from the fi of memory, is the coming alive of the fi of expe- riential immediacy, in its emergent dance of attention.16
