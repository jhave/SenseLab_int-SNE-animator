activation contour6—with a signifi     difference. Native to the visual system is the tendency to structure its fi not at any-point, but at a focal point. What in the gestural nexus was a multivectorial knot now homes into ret- inal focus. The throwing of the curve becomes a stand-out, stand-alone, visually focused form. The stand-alone form of the movement belongs wholly to vision. But it can belong to vision only because it has come to stand out in this way from the shared activation contour that triggered its appearance. In this shared activation contour, movement and vision dynamically coincide. They are in a state of dynamic superposition across their difference from each other, each in its own manner, on its own reg- ister, according to its own order.
The sharing of the activation contour passes through the middle. Of itself, it is in neither register. It is in transit. It is trans-manner, trans-register, trans-order: transductive.7 What is in trans-manner is amodal: neither in one modality of life nor another, but in the coming-to-pass of their dis- junctive synthesis.8 In the rhythm of the passing event that is life in this moment. The visual form is not displayed. The movement is not portrayed in it. Life splays into it.
Could not precisely the same be said of the relation between move- ment and language? Language and vision? The different planes of life come concertedly together in their disjunction, linked eventfully in an analogy that is grounded in their difference from each other, rather than any for- mal identity or resemblance. The dynamic analogy of amodal superposi- tion is what Walter Benjamin, discussing the relation between language, gesture, and vision, termed a “nonsensuous similarity” (Benjamin 2004; Massumi 2011, 105–10, 123–24). Just like that. Just like this. One, two, one, one-two one-two, sprayed multiply across the registers of an experientially splayed event.
