abstinence. Now life itself will have to function as its own power of intox- ication, undoubtedly altering the fi	of relation and form of life.
The point is not that drinking is good or bad. That kind of moral evalu- ation is made according to criteria extrinsic to the process. The immanent evaluation of the process concerns only its continuing in the same rela- tional fi    or switching fi     and form of life. When the process contin- ues, it is because it has succeeded in affi	its own operations through an immanent, qualitative, self-modulating evaluation. When it passes the threshold toward change, it poses the existential question of what germi- nal form of life and future qualities of experience lie beyond the threshold. Although neither good nor bad a priori, in whichever way the limit-idea plays out, the immanent evaluation it involves is never neutral. It ideally contributes to sustaining and modulating, or regerminating, forms of life. This makes it, of itself, a creative factor and force of life.
