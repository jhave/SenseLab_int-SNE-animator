line: the polyrhythmic force of expression that sustains and modulates living-together, intuitively resisting calculation.
The gift of giving is ineffable, known only in the interruption it stages. What it interrupts are tendencies that might move toward a crossing of a threshold. This realigns the fi of relation by repositioning exchange in excess of human-centered reciprocity. The gift of giving belongs to excess, immanent excess: a fi of sociality overfull of its own rhythms and rebe- ginnings, brimming with transindividual concern for the modalities of exchangeability it calls forth.
The giving of giving is a ritual of emergent attunement that is a tech- nique for reorienting the event of coming-together. It alters time. The now of giving is already reorienting in a future-fi	of the moment. Giving sets into motion an anticipation of the limit that futures the present in the making in such a way as to make felt and simultaneously ward off a necessary crossing of a threshold—in a kind of preemptive politics.
To the extent that potlatch wards off the crossing of the threshold, it ensures a conservative function (in the most basic defi	of the word, as preserving or sustaining). It has a radicality as well, to the extent that it makes intensively felt, as a creative factor, the same limit whose crossing it preempts. Generating the Impossible means to play the limit of artistic activ- ity, in the context in which we work, making felt the potential crossing of its threshold—but without prescribing whether, when, and in what manner the threshold is to be crossed. The decision to cross into a new relational fi    which in this case is not one of violence but is one of struggle—is not the province of the event organizers, or of any individual. It can only be a decision for the event by the event in respect of its processual autonomy.
