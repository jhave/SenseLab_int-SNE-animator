“This notion of the environment,” says Whitehead, “introduces the notion of the ‘more and less’, and of multiplicity” (1968,  7). The  idea is not simply to turn the tables, and say that neurotypicals suffer from environmentblindness owing to their focus on the human, and on the human-centric use-value that the objectiles active in the environment may be  cast  for. Neurotypicals also  have environmental awareness, “more and less”:  more peripheralized, less often attended to in its own right. Conversely, most socalled “low-functioning” autistics are not without language, as the quotations in the previous section show, even though many are without spoken language. “Not being able  to speak is not the same as not having anything to say,” reads one of the slogans of the Autistic Liberation Front.11 Despite their initial focus on the qualitative relationality of  emergent environments, autistics are also  capable, more and less,  depending on many factors, of perceiving “objectively.” By “objectively” we mean in a mode in which focalized impacts, and their eventual uses  and recountings in language, single themselves out as particular affordances from the fielding of the environment. We call this the mode of entrainment.
