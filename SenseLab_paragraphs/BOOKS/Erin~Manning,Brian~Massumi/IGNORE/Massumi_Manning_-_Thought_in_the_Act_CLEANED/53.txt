Autism activist Jim Sinclair writes, “Autism isn’t something a person has, or a ‘shell’ that a person is trapped inside. There’s no normal child hidden behind the autism. Autism is a way of being. It is pervasive; it colors every experience, every sensation, perception, thought, emotion, and encounter, every aspect of existence. It is not possible to separate the autism from the person—and if it were  possible, the person you’d have left  would not be the same person you started with” (1993).  Persons come in many modes. And  persons become.
