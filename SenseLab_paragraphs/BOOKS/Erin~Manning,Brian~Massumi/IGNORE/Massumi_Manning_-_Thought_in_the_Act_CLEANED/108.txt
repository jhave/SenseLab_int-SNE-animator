Every  site  is a prehensive interlocking of reciprocal modes in bare activity.  There is no “simple location” (Whitehead 1967b,  69–71).  The  smile spreads over the face, as the face fits itself onto the smile (Whitehead 1967b, 71). The  couch fits  itself to the body, as the body spreads itself over the couch. The  fit  is already apportioning this double potential the instant the couch is perceived, even at an uncomfortable distance. In the underlying  activity of every perception, there is one two-way movement of reciprocal interfusion already incipiently, actively taking account. “Our body penetrates the sofa  on which it sits;  and the sofa  penetrates our body” (Boccioni 1970,  28).  “What emanates from bodies and what emanates from architectural surrounds intermix” (AG 2002, 61). A modal location is a field of experience.
