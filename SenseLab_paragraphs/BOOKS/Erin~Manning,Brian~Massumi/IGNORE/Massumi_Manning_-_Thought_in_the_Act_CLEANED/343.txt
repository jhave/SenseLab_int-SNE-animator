The  SenseLab was  founded in 2004 by  Erin  Manning with the aim of exploring this problematic field. Dedicated as it was  to a practice of the event, the SenseLab avoided defining itself in a formal organizational structure. It was conceived as a flexible meeting ground whose organizational form would arise  as a function of its projects, and change as the projects evolved. Process would be emphasized over deliverable products. In  fact, process itself would be the SenseLabâ€™s product. Membership would be based on elective affinities. Anyone who considered himself or herself a member was one. The  result is a shifting mix of students and professors, theorists and practitioners, from a wide range of disciplines and practices.
