Double vision, in the end, is less  about vision than it is about proprioception. To “visualize” a movement is to “see” it proprioceptively: in body-vision.17 To move into the futurity of movement-moving is to have a body-vision in the dancing. It is to move with the future in its unfolding, to be moving in the very  creation of space-times of experience, to be caught up,  just like that, in the simultaneity of the wake of movement perishing as it meets the welling of its futurity, dancing at the nexus of experience infolding.
