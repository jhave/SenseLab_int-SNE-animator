“Modes of existence are always plural and relational,” writes Etienne Souriau: “existence can be found not only in beings, but between them” (2009, 16). Modes of existence are intermodal. As defined by Souriau and Gilbert Simondon (2005), modes of existence do  not reify  being by taking  it as already constituted. They involve comings-to-existence through singular events where objects are  in the making. The  modality of  the events’ singular coming-to-be is the existence. There is not an alreadyconstituted being that has  the modality. The  modality makes the being. Modes of existence are not only intermodal, they are also  plural in relation to themselves, each containing the others in germ, to a degree, as an internal difference that is a compositional feature of its  own texturing. Each tends to want of the others. Modes of existence have an inbred appetite for each other, and cannot easily sustain themselves separately, try as they might sometimes.
