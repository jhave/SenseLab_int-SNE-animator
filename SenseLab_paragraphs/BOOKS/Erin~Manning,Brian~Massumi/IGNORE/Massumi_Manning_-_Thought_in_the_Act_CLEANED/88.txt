“I taught myself to read at three,” Amanda Baggs relates, “and I had to learn it again at ten, and yet again at seventeen, and at twenty-one, and at twenty-six. The  words that it took me  twelve years to find have been lost again, and regained, and lost, and still  have not come all the way  back to where I can be reasonably confident they’ll be there when I need them. It wasn’t enough to figure out just once how to keep track of my  eyes  and ears  and hands and feet  all at the same time; I’ve lost  track of them and had to find them over and over again” (2010d).
