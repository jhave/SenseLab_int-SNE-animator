Yet the process does start with the flip of a switch. In the Eurydice series (1992–2007), the switch was  the on button of  a photocopier.  A found image was consigned to the machine. The  machine’s role  was to give  the already-there of the found image a new beginning. This was done by stopping the copying midrun, before the toner had completely set.  Unsettled grains were  left  in chance-swept motion, setting the stilled contours of the image to drift. This machinic reinstilling of movement dispossessed the found image of its status as an origin, distancing the painting process from the touchstone of the photo’s recognized content.2 The  image rebegins, in a play of light interacting not with a viewer, but with the electric charges of the toner particles and the drum. Interacting not perceptually, but machinically and materially, outside the traditional painterly domain.
