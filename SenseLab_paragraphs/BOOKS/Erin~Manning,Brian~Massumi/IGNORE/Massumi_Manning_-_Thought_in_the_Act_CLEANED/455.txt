The point is not that drinking is good or bad. That kind of moral evaluation is made according to criteria extrinsic to the process. The immanent evaluation of the process concerns only its  continuing in the same relational field, or switching fields  and form of life. When the process continues,  it is because it has  succeeded in affirming its own operations through an immanent, qualitative, self-modulating evaluation. When it passes the threshold toward change, it poses the existential question of what germinal form of life and future qualities of experience lie beyond the threshold. Although neither good nor bad a priori, in whichever way  the limit-idea plays out, the immanent evaluation it involves is never neutral. It ideally contributes to sustaining and modulating, or regerminating, forms of life. This  makes it, of itself, a creative factor and force of life.
