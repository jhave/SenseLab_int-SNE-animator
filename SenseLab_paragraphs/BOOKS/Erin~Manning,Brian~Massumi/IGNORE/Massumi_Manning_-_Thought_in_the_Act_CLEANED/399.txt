This  notion of differential embeddedness in the unfolding of a collective, distributed event was explicitly a rejection of the notion of the “common.” Care organized itself not around the common but around the irreducibly singular. It concerned being-different-together and becoming-together as an expression of those differences, as part of a shared process participated in differentially. Care, as  care  for  the event, assumes no commons, in the sense of an equality of access to a preexisting, valorizable resource. It assumes no commonality or  ethos of consensus, in the sense of general characteristics or  convictions adhered to by  all.  And  it assumes no community, in the sense of a defining identity that precedes and determines a collectivity’s coming-together and sets a priori boundaries to that convergence. All it assumes is the eventful integration of group differentials, in and for the singularity of an event, for only as long as the event sustains its own self-organizing process.
