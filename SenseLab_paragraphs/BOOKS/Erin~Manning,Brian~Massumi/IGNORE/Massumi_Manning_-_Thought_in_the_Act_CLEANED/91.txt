Approaches opposed to this cerebral reductionism, such as embodied cognition and enactive perception, often appeal to phenomenology in order to restore the experiential field’s  fullness. For  our part, we  cannot follow this line, because for phenomenology the field  of immediate experience is always-already subjective or, to be more precise, “pre-subjective” (in the sense of already imbued with specifically human meaning just waiting  to be  “disclosed,” or  translatable from the status of “implicit knowledge” into an explicit schema). For us, as for autistics, this isn’t the case. We approach the field of experience as “pure,” in William James’s sense of being neither subjective nor objective yet—yet ready to be both or either, more and less, multiplicitously. Whatever human meaning an experience has, whatever schema it exhibits, it has  achieved them, as an adventure of  integrally renewed self-composition and emergent variation, starting always all over again from the “bald” commotional “that” of the gateway that is moment. This  forbids appealing to phenomenology as a corrective to our discomfort with neuroreductionism.
