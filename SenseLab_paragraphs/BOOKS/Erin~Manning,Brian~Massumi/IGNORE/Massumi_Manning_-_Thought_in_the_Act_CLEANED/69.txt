Take  this example of Mukhopadhyay’s. In  the context of a classroom much below his  intellectual level, he is asked to add 4  + 2.  When he is seemingly incapable of  following through with the task, the teacher quickly comes to the conclusion that his  intellect is deficient, assuming that because Mukhopadhyay did  not come up with the answer she  had expected, he is incapable of carrying through even the simplest of mathematical equations. Yet listen to how Mukhopadhyay relates the story: I was  wondering why the hell that 4 had to interact with the number 2, through a + sign. [. . .] I looked at the number 2, wondering about the coordinate axes  of the plane surface and the probable coordinate points that 2 would hold. And  as I saw the position of 2 somewhere on the upper side  of the page, I mentally assigned it with the coordinate points of 3 and 7. Three as the x coordinate and 7 as the y coordinate. I could see the page divided into graphic grids. I heard my  aide saying something like I needed to finish up my  work. But I was busy assigning a coordinate value to 4. Finally, I settled with the values of 3 and 9 as x and y coordinates. I gave  a quick value to the addition sign also. Then I found a whole story of  number characters other than merely 2 and 4, competing, quarreling, and asserting themselves to be written down. Finally, I needed the help of “average.” I took the average on the x side  and the average on the y side  to bring peace among the numbers. (2008, 154–55)
