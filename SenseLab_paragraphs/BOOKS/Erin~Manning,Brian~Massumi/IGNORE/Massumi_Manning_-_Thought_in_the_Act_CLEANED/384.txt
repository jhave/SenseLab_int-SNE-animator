Letting go was one of the event’s central enabling constraints. It would plan into the event the same kind of fissional-fusional evolution that failures facilitate on an unplanned basis. The  injunction to let go was dropped on participants without warning. It came as something of a shock to the system and elicited a certain resistance.
The  resistance itself proved productive because it required a collective working-out of the force of the injunction. In terms of its processual effect as well as in terms of the justifiability, relative to the event’s self-organizing, of imposing enabling constraints through a decisional act  by a subset of those involved. This  brought out issues related to the positivity of ostensibly  “negative” constraints, and to the complex interplay of degrees of creative “freedom” and power of decision. It has  always been a premise of the SenseLab that a purely consensual process deadens potential and that irruptions of decision are  necessary for  the vitality of a creative process. The  innovation we meant to convey was the yoking of “decision” to “letting go,” practiced as an enabling constraint and a technique of relation, so that even in the case  of an arbitrarily imposed decision, power would facilitate “power-to” and not “power-over.” Yoked to letting go, under the proper conditions of an ethics of engagement, arbitrary decision can operate  as a condition of spontaneity that actually activates greater degrees of collective freedom.
