exception of  the apocryphal anecdote about Virginia Woolf and the Dalai Lama
(discussed below).
3.   On the rhythm and milieu, see  “Of  the Refrain” in Deleuze and Guattari
(1987, 310–50).
4.   The first part of this phrase is spoken repeatedly by both dancers in the 2011
revival of Woolf Phrase.
5.   The  concept of simple location is famously critiqued in Whitehead (1967a,
49–55, 58).
6.   On the concept of the activation contour, see Stern (1985,  57–59)  and Massumi (2011,  107–14,  122–25).
7.   On transduction, see  Simondon (2005, 31–33,  107–10 and  passim)  and
Combes (2012, 6–9).
8.   On the amodal, see Stern (1985,  47–53)  and Massumi (2011,  17–18, 109–13,
122–23).
9.   Sheets-Johnstone (2009a, 2009b) critiques the concept of the sensorimotor in embodied cognition and enactive perception theory on similar grounds. See, in particular, Sheets-Johnstone (2009a, 377, 394–95; 2009b, 221).
10.   On syllogism and generality, see Deleuze (1990, 294–97).
11.   For Sheets-Johnstone’s critique of embodiment, see Sheets-Johnstone (2009a,
390, 392, 393; 2009b, 215, 220).
12.   On the “relation of non-relation” (65)  between language and vision (their incommensurability and disjunctive synthesis), see Deleuze’s analysis of “visibilities” and “statements” in the work of Foucault (Deleuze 1988,  47–69): “What we  see is not lodged in what we say” (64; translation modified). For Klee on the gray  point as originary any-point of “primordial” motion, which Klee places at the center of the color wheel, and thus of the visual field, see Klee (1978, 3–4).
13.   On the thirdness of experience and the “sea” of traces as reserve of potential
(specifically as regards sound and language), see Massumi (2012).
14.   This  term was  suggested to us by Sheets-Johnstone’s essay “Sensori-Kinetic Understandings of Language” (2009b, 219–52). The term occurs on page 236. SheetsJohnstone emphasizes the overlap (what we would term a “superposition” or “zone of  indistinction”) between language and movement in the motions of  the body that are  physically productive of speech. She  uses  the term “motional-relational” for  that overlap and to argue that nonlinguistic dimensions of experience are  not “prelinguisitic” but rather that language is “post-kinetic” (225). We take the concept of  the post-kinetic in Sheets-Johnstone to imply a disjunctive synthesis between language and movement, rising from and returning to their zone of  indistinction, as  each come into themselves coming into and out of  each other. For  our
