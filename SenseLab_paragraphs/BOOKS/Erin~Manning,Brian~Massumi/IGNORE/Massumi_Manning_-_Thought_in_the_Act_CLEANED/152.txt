“The middle,” Deleuze says,  “is  not an average, but an excess. It is through the middle that things grow. This was an idea of Virginia Woolf’s” (1979, 96). The middle is the extremity of disjunctive synthesis, as a growth medium: the milieu of the performance’s accruing to itself. The pattern of the passings through the middle give texture to the rhythmic space of the piece’s occurring. Somehow, collectively beginning, collecting difference. Somehow, suspended in disjunctive synthesis.
