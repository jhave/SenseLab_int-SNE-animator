She  moves back to the microphone, his  body still  connected to hers, his  balance passing through an arabesque. She: stricken twice. An arabesque, spiraling already into a circling, his body folding through her backward movement. She,  reaching toward him. Hands held, a sense of push and pull. A suspended connection, wary of the measure of the touch, it seems. For while the movement looks to proceed by cause and effect, in fact what is active is a mobile relational intervalâ€”a co-constitutive suspension of movement in the moving. Touch strikes. It cuts into the relational interval. It does not stop movement so much as set  it in motion, again, differently. It reorganizes, reorients, pulling movement-moving into knifeedge precision. A moment of clarity. Stricken.
