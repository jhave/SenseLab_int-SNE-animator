An unsettling of what might otherwise demand to be seen, the friend creates  an uneasy disturbance in the field. The  friend is only an ally  insofar as it contributes to a thinking-feeling tremulously poised on the edge of what cannot quite be thought, felt,  said, or painted. The  intercessor carries  the power of the false:  a noncorrespondence between the emergent act  and its  expected expression that keeps the act  in nonresemblance to itself. “These powers of the false  that will  produce truth” (Deleuze 1995, 126), this is what the intercessors are.
