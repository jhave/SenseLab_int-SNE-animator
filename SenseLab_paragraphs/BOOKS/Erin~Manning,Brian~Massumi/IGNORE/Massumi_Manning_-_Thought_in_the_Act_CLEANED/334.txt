We were  looking to inhabit otherwise, to practice what we call,  following  Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, an “immanent” critique. An immanent critique engages with new processes more than new products, from a constructivist angle. It seeks  to energize new modes of activity, already in germ, that seem to offer  a potential to escape or overspill ready-made channelings into the dominant value system. The  strategy of immanent critique is to inhabit one’s complicity and make it turn—in the sense in which butter “turns” to curd. Our project was to try to do our small part to curdle “research-creation’s” annexation to the neoliberal economy.
