To the extent that potlatch wards off the crossing of the threshold, it ensures a conservative function (in  the most basic definition of the word, as preserving or sustaining). It has  a radicality as well,  to the extent that it makes intensively felt, as a creative factor, the same limit whose crossing it preempts. Generating the Impossible means to play the limit of artistic activity, in the context in which we work, making felt the potential crossing of its threshold—but without prescribing whether, when, and in what manner the threshold is to be crossed. The  decision to cross  into a new relational field—which in this case  is not one of violence but is one of struggle—is not the province of the event organizers, or of any individual. It can only be a decision for the event by the event in respect of its processual autonomy.
