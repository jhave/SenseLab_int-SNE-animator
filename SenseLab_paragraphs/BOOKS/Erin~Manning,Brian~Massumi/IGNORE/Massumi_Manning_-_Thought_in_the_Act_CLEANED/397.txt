The  “care” involved was not a personal quality or a private subjective state. It was a collective practice of care:  an enactive, technique-based concern on the part of each group for the process of another group and for the overall process in which all the groups were  implicated. Care was considered an impersonal technique for an ethics of engagement taking a directly political (“diplomatic”) form. It was  understood in terms of care  for  the event (like  the event’s hospitality) in which a collectivity was equally but differentially implicated. Everyone was  actively together in the event, in each case  from a different angle of approach expressing the singularity of a local process networking with others. Collectively singular.
