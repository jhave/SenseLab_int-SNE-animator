What cannot stand still  in Ettinger’s work is not simply figure or form. It is the line: line becoming figurably indiscernible. Reduce yourself “to  an abstract line, a trait, in order to find [a] zone of indiscernibility with other traits” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 280). “Distance—The tree  of this green, the face of these lines” (Ettinger 1993, 9).
