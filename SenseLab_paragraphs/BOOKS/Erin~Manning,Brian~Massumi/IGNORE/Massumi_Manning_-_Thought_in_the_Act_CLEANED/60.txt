The  autism rights movement emphasizes the multiplicity of modes of existence, under the term “neurodiversity.” They are not only signaling the need to attend to the blooming of fields of relation from which neither predefined objects nor overshadowing subjects have yet to be singled out; they are alerting us as well  to the intricacies of perception across the spectrum. For neurotypicals are in fact neurodiverse, also immediately perceiving  relation. The  difference is the speed of subtraction of objects from the total field, owing to the field’s pre-perfusion with entrainment. Under certain circumstances, neurotypicals themselves experience a predominance of  environmental  awareness. It  is rarely focused on, though, appearing as an ephemeral interlude between more substantial-feeling affordances. When environmental awareness does resurface, it is without fully bloomed objects and overshadowing subjects, as autistics describe. But there is still a degree of difference between this and other modes of existence on the wider spectrum of neurodiversity. Because entrainment reigns as an immediate tendency in neurotypicals, even when they are  immersed in a selfentertaining relational field, affordances already agitate, but are  not yet objectified. For the neurotypical standing in a grassy farmer’s field  painting  a flower, the flowering of experience may immediately present itself for  artistic rendering, as it does for  autistics. But  there will  likely also  be an equally immediate sense of how the flower stands in relation to grass and trees, including a tacit cartography of how to get  from road to field to flower and back, and what that trajectory might afford. This efficacious orienting occurs directly as a field-effect, on the level  of the objectile, not on the level  of constituted objects as such.
