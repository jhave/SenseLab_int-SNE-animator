The threshold shifts. It vibrates. It is not figure or form. Not this or that history, this or that memory. It resonates with all it touches. But it cannot quite be seen.
For  Ettinger, painting is  not about seeing. It  is  felt, it touches, it moves, it resonates. To paint the outside is about a feeling-with, a thinkingfeeling that occurs in a relational field, across works in the making. This studio that Ettinger has  made herself is not haphazard: its relational environment is set up to make the outside a participant.
