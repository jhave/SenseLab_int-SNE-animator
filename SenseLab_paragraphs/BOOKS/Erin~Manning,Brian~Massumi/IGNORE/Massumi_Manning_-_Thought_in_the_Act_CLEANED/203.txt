When Forsythe speaks of not wanting to miss  seeing “what’s actually in front of my  eyes,” it seems that he is referring to vision in the standard sense. Look  in the mirror and see what’s there, right in front of you. He wants to see what is happening, and to choreograph with the present in the mode of the just-like-that. No ideas in advance—let the process show you its own evolution. “Don’t be afraid to let  things reveal themselves,” Forsythe tells  his  dancers. “Sometimes it [what the work’s about] doesn’t come until the end” (Corbin 2012). See it for what it is, in the middling of its coming to be. The  problem is, the movement is aligning to futurity, its reflection askance. One hundred years from now: that’s me, silly! How can he or the dancers work with “what’s actually in front of my  eyes” when it is landing onto the present from the unknowability of the future? How can they work with the mirror when the mirror at once reflects me  and you, one, two, one-two  in the uncertain field of vision that includes the now and the one hundred years from now? What does it mean to “really see” in the mode of the speculative?
