Coming-in.
The  face exceeds the I, exceeds the human relation. As friend, the face from the outside cleaves the figure asunder, cutting into the comfort of knowing where this or that vision, this or that memory, is headed. Spectral faciality as co-poietic, a co-composition with the forces of a seriation—a speciation—in the making.
The  friend, “indissociably what is closest and farthest away” (Foucault 1999,  2, 164).  With, across, and outside.
