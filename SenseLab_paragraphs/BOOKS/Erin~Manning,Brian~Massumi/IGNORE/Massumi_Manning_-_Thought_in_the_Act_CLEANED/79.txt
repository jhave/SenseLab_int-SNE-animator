It is as yet  but a cognizable factor in field  experience. When the moment has penned itself into a determinate emergence, consciousness begins to flicker. It is holding “pen” and its use-value distinctly in the foreground, in a now object-centered experience. The  field  is no longer saturated with entrainment, but is heavy with it, locally. The  singled-out object “pen” bears all the weight of  it.  Field-wide entertainment, its  integral relationality, has been backgrounded. But  the foreground only stands out because it has  a background to stand out from. Background and foreground are in mutual embrace, the backgrounded activity still vying for attention. Consciousness flickers with the tension between backgrounded environmental awareness and foregrounded cognition. Cognition is the impossibility of grasping the field  in all of its cognizable effects. This  is what it means to be conscious “in” a pen, as opposed to be cognizant “of”  it. It means to be conscious in a commotional becoming-penfield.
