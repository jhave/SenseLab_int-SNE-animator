5.   Participants were solicited using the call reproduced at the end of Propositions for Thought in the Act. The cutoff was nine months before the start of the actual event, to leave adequate time for preparatory activities. A few participants who contacted us late in the process were put on a waiting list and later admitted to the event. We wanted the event to be as inclusive as possible, and worked to keep possibilities open for anyone expressing a serious interest.
6.   All the food for the SenseLab events has  come from the Fruiterie Mile-End, a family-owned Montreal landmark. In the spirit of the gift,  the Fruiterie has  always charged us  wholesale prices and provided us  with older produce free  of  charge. We  consider the neighborhood ethos provided by the Fruiterie (and by its owner, Javed “Bob” Iqbal, in particular) as very  much in keeping with what the SenseLab’s attempts to achieve through its event series.
