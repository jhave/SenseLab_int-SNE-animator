From the perspective developed here, the notion of neural correlates— the idea that experiential events “correspond” to brain states—errs in presupposing the dichotomy between the determinately physical and the fickly perceptual. In our account, following James and Whitehead, this distinction takes form on the highly derived level  of reflective consciousness, which is itself predicated on the subtractive emergence of cognition from a richer and more encompassing field  of coming experience. The  search for neural correlates glosses over the immediacy of the field of experience, its phased becomings and variations, its flickerings, its constant reminders that the simplicity of clear consciousness is no measure of the complexity of complete experience. The  search for  neural correlates glosses over this intensity and complexity in theory, while in practice it constantly returns to it without acknowledging that move.
