The  passing of the threshold into the event would have to signal that what was coming was different from the norm and that the usual rituals of self-presentation and self-positioning based on achieved reputations and disciplinary stature would not be encouraged. This would have to be done in an inviting and even comforting way. A kind of hospitable estrangement was necessary. For the welcome, the model of hospitality was consciously adopted, rather than the more usual one of gate  keeping and accreditation (registration, identification by institutional affiliation). But what we wanted to stress was not our hospitability, our generosity, but the event’s own emergent modalities of hospitality. Participants were  individually greeted and ushered past the threshold, where a space awaited that contained none of the expected accoutrements—no tables at the front for a presenter, no chairs in rows for an audience, no podium, no stage. Instead, a number of “affordances” presented themselves that did not take an immediately recognizable form, so that they had to be  arrived at through exploration (for example, comfortable seating opportunities without actual seats). These were  thought of as “attractors.” They were  meant to encourage a certain active self-organizing on the participants’ part even as they arrived, based on an affective pull toward particular affordance rather than a prestructured setting into place.
