Take  an animated conversation. Words move between participants, accompanied by  gestures. These gestures, while tuned  to the words, perform a  kind of  alternate rhythm, opening the conversation to its prearticulationâ€”the ways  in which it moves beyond the said  into the register of the felt but unsaid. As the gestures begin to affect how the conversation evolves, they begin to play off each other, in a rhythm of alternation and overlay, creating complex patterns of resonant emphasis and contrapuntal divergence. But  this does not happen through imitation or mimicry.  The  gestures do  not repeat the simultaneous flow  of words, nor do they resemble or match them. They accompany them, on their own level, in a manner all their own.
