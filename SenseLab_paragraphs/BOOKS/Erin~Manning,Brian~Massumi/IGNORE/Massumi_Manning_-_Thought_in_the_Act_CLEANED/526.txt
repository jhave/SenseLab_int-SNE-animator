Generating the impossible is no humble proposition, but Generating the Impossible was  a humble event. Faced with the grandness of the proposition, we endeavored collectively to develop new ways  of working together across two distant and heterogeneous sites. Our hope was to touch on how creative practices, and how art  and politics, can co-compose in researchcreation. Many of the event’s undertakings were  tentative, and remained germinal. We  had a few  solid starting points: the readings, a year  of collective thinking, the Sentimental Construction and Tubular Loom propositions, the gift-giving passage across the threshold. But  still, to come up with a strong artwork, articulated with emergent conceptual intensities,  within five days is a mammoth task  by any standard. To do  so with people who in some cases  you are meeting in person for the first time is a challenge. We worked hard, in and across our affinity groups, taking joy in little emergences, and keeping in mind that germinality itself, rather than a finished product, was the goal:  that the product was process. As always for SenseLab events, the measure of success would be the intensity of the next event this one seeded, as well  as the creative partnerships formed through SenseLab participation spinning off into extra-SenseLab collaborations. Success for  the SenseLab is centrifugal: the seeding of processual spin-offs. The  truest measure of  the SenseLab’s success are  successes for which it cannot claim credit.
