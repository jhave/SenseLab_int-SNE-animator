This brings to mind William James’s work on the pen in relation to consciousness. James writes, This  pen is . . . in the first  instance, a bald that [. . .] To  get classed either as a physical pen or  as someone’s percept of  a pen, it must assume a function. . . . So far as in that world it is a stable feature, holds ink, marks paper and obeys the guidance of the hand, it is a physical pen. [. . .] So far as it is instable . . . coming and going with the movements of  my  eyes, altering with what I call my  fancy, continuous with subsequent experiences of its “having been” (in  the past tense), it is the percept of a pen in my  mind. Those peculiarities are what we mean by being “conscious” in a pen. (1996, 123–24)
