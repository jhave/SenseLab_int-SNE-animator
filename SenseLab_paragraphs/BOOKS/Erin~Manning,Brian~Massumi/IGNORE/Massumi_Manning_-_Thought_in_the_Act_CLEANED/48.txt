The  emergence continues. “I could now imagine how a shadow could silence the interaction between other colors if those colors happened to fall in the territory of its silence.” A hiatus forms in the commotion, made of the same interacting qualities as the commotion. “I could see the night jasmines wet  with morning dew, lit  with fresh sunshine, trying to form a story with their jasmine-petal smell. I would see the story spread in the air”  (Mukhopadhyay 2008, 21–22).  A new quality, a fragrance, arrives in the hiatus. A flowering dances to attention as the event of this ingression. Jasmine gathers the play of color and shadow around itself, transmuted into an interplay of moisture and light. Light and moisture, in co-motion with a smell. The  fragrance of jasmine, in its interplay with moisture and light, takes the relay from colored shadow as the predominant quality of the compositional field  as a whole. This  relay brings the field  to the verge of determinate expression. In the field’s perfusion by smell, a story is trying to form. The  field  is moving through its perfusion toward a recounting of itself. It is striving to be taken into account.7 The  flower has  appeared as a function of this striving. It is not a discrete object. The  field  of immediate experience is not composed of objects. The flower is the relational conduit for a field-wide tendency to expression. It might be called an objectile rather than a fully bloomed object: a bud of an object. The  field  composes buds of objects as a function of its appetition for expression.
