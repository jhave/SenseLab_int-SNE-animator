Movement generation techniques in the Forsythe Company are enlivened by a paradox of double vision. To be in the present in its unfolding is to be in the future-flow of a nonlinear time-match. The  sensorimotor is always in commotion with the motional-relational, in disjunctive synthesis. The  body, articulating in the present the complexity of dance-form, is always also being asked to match-flow to a welling future movement. The sensorimotor is alive in the taking-form, led  by  the motional relational, poised at the limit where now and next are co-composing.
