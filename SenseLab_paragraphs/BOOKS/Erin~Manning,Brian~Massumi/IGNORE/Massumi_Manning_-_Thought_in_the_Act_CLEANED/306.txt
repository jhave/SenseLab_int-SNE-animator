The  Eurydice series  starts in the same palette. The  colors thicken. The emergent  figural  field-effects become  less   formed,  more  vibratory. The  vibration no longer comes from the figure vacillating between the foreground and the background. It comes from color vibrating with itself, foregrounding-backgrounding itself across the darkness that once was contour but is no more. It doesnâ€™t end there. Clouds of white start to emerge, on their own account, shivering, released from any tie to fuzziness of contour. In this series, the movement of the painting spreads across the canvas. Intensive movement over distances.
