social bonding and political processes, all central to the maintenance of a society. The  Canadian government considered the practice to be destructive of the stability and established hierarchy of native communities and it was  outlawed (from 1884 until 1951) and rigorously suppressed.” Robert Drislane and Gary Parkinson, “Potlatch,” Online  Dictionary of the Social Sciences, produced by Athabasca University and ICAAP, http://bitbucket.icaap.org/dict.pl?alpha=P.
44.   It is important to note that there is little theoretical writing from Pacific West Coast First  Nations on the potlatch. It comes up as a context more often in poetry and literature, which suggests that for the writers it has  a tendency to morph based on the specific conditions of its coming to be.  In reading Mauss’s accounts (1966), we must therefore keep in mind that his approach was always anthropological and, as such, tending toward the generalization of the practice. His  vocabulary is also one that is informed by the economics of his time and his location: capitalism. The challenge is to read across Mauss to find, as  Derrida (1992)  does, the openings, the inconsistencies, and the contradictions within his  accounting of a practice so foreign to his  cultural bias.
