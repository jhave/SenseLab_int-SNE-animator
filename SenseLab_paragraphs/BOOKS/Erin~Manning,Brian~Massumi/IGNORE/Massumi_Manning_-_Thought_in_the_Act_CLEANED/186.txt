Going extremely fast,  as Forsythe suggests, is a key technique for making movement move. When a body folds in on its own gestures faster than the general speed limit of sensorimotor coordination, it self-generates an inflection of its line of movement. It activates to the extreme, and throws itself a curve, across the regenerative interval of its return to the any-point. You have to go so fast as to “be ahead of yourself” (Forsythe 2011, Nov. 23). “Don’t be  adaptive, be  predictive” (Forsythe 2011,  Nov. 10).  That is,  be speculative. Feel it coming at the speed of thought.
