There is always an excess of the feeling in the feeling, by which it overflows, or overfills, its designation. In “just like this,” the “this” is too full to be designated just one. one separation, one, two. one. two.  one, one-two. Disjunctive synthesis.
It’s like  this. Just,  like,  sad.  Supposedly without happiness. Like,  sad. Teenage speech patterns get  it:  “Like”  does not designate an identity or resemblance. It marks an affective overflow in speech. This  feeling is just sad.  More than that, it is just like  sad  is. It refracts all sadness, and its difference from happiness, in the singular feeling this is. The  words “somehow” and “just like that” mark the affective tonality of the moment. They mark affect in language. They linguistically gesture to the feeling tone of the moment. Although marked in language, the feeling tone has  risen from the middle, in the passing between language and movement.
