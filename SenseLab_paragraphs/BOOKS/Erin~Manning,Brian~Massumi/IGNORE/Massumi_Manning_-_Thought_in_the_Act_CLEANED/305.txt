The  coloration evolves across the series. In Autistwork, No. 1, the color is muted. There is vibratory movement but it is localized, tightly wound between the dark of the figural contours and a fuzziness clouding them. Movement still.  Faces,  figures appear disappearing.  Their forms flicker between the foreground and the background. Since the movement comes of an interplay between dark and light, contour and blurring, the field  of appearing-disappearing remains tied to form, if only residually (trace-form). As the Autistwork series  evolves (1993â€“94), paintings begin to ask for color. From the clouding comes blue, then red. The  conditions for  a violeting. A spectrum of color, a palette, is phasing in. Its coming starts moving the series  away from the interplay between dark and light, as attached to contour and blurring, toward color and clouding.
