Forsythe’s work builds on the what-if. It is never a question of formally working something out in advance. Speaking of  his  collaboration with composer Thom Willems, he explains: “He  always wants to know what are  we thinking and I say  nothing, we’re  just, we’re  just organising bodies” (Forsythe 2003a). We  are not thinking, the thinking is in the moving.
