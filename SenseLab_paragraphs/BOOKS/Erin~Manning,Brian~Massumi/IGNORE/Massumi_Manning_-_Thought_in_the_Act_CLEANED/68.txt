But what of the classroom? What of our neurotypical children who cannot sit still  as they are told how and what to learn? Where is that joy  we remember in their perpetually moving and ephemeral four-year-old bodies before the classroom took over? What presuppositions exist in the very notion of the neurotypical? The “epidemic” of “attention-deficit disorder” rings alarm bells. Might not the diagnoses betray an inattention on the part of adults to an attentiveness of a different order? One mode of existence’s deficit may be another’s fullness.
