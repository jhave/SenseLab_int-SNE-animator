The  threshold will  always be  evoked along with the limit. It  resonates with it, as the last  is already pre-echoed in the penultimate. As long as the penultimate is potentializing, the last  remains a virtual pre-echo of  the becoming-other of  the process. Activating the limit of  art  makes its virtual passage into a political process resonate already in its aesthetic unfolding. The  exploded gallery is this politico-aesthetic resonanceâ€”this play between the potentializing limit of art  and its virtual threshold into the political. Expressing this resonance is problematizing: it cannot but ask, When? When, under what conditions, will or should the threshold be passed? When, to what qualitative effects, composing what forms of life,
should the limit be respected?
