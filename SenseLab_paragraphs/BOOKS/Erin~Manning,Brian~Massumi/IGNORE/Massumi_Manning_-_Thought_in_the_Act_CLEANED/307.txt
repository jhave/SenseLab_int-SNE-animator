Then something happens again. The photocopier is replaced by the digital  scanner. Scanography takes over from xerography. The  painting process  moves scanographically into the No Title  Yet  series. No Title  Yet  Nos. 1–3 rebegin the painting process from scans of Eurydice No. 23. The scanner is set so “the figural aspect does not transfer to the scan” (Ettinger 2010). Nor  does the color transfer. “The color in the scans is reduced to greys and whites”: to cloudiness and white (not  black and white, or  dark versus light). Cloudiness and white: degrees of light. Whiteness self-relating. What traces of faces  and figures will  emerge come from this interplay of light. Few recognizable figures appear any longer. It is fitting that the series has  no title.
