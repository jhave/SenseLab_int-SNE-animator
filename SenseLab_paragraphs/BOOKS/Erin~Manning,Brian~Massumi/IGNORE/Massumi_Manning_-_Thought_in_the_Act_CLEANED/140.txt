The piece begins and ends in a recurrent circling that asks us to encounter  how language opens itself to movement and how movement cocomposes with this opening. Refrains return again and again: “just like that,” “somehow,” “all of a sudden,” “PAAF!” as the piece circles the twisting  of bodies around the mewling of a sea gull, the barking of dogs, the buzzing of bees, the surging of waves. These refrains haunt the piece, and echo beyond it. When we would leave the rehearsals, they would follow us.  We  would find ourselves reperforming what we had just participated in as spectators. At any moment, we  would catch ourselves parsing our actions and comments with a just  like that. PAAF! We  would sound to a hand gesture recurring from the dance, punctuating the passage from this moment to the next.
