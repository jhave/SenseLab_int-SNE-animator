We are not saying that this has no value. Our point is that the activity of neurons enters the event on an equal footing with other ingredients: from the angle of neurons’ ability to co-compose relational field-effects. Alone, they are nothing. Together with other ingredients, which are of every conceivable determinable nature, the neurons vie to have their “voice” heard most loudly in the way in which the event moves toward expression. Take me!  Take  me!  The  neuroscientist takes them happily—without realizing that it is when the neuronal as such is most determining of the outcome of the event that the event is operating at its most automatic. The “physical” is in fact  a limit-state of the habitual, its extreme. Much goes  into making a habit besides electrical impulses and chemical signals. A whole world of relationality enters into it, subtractively. The physical as automatic-habitual is a subtractive limitation of the dance of attention of the field  of experience. Extracting it from the field is adding subtraction to subtraction, carrying  the emphasis-by-subtraction of habit to a higher power. This is exactly what makes neurocentric modeling so useful therapeutically: it isolates the subtractive limit of the field of experience’s functioning. At the limit of that limit lies the pathological: when the automaticity of the physical takes over to the point of undermining the use-value of habit on other levels of the relational world. The  whole setup is contrived as a function of the pathological. That is our point: the neuro is inherently a therapeutic concept contrived with and for the pathological—which is to say that it is guided by an a priori commitment to a presupposed, quantifiable, base-state distinction between the normal and the pathological. No matter what kind of philosophical calisthenics are performed around it, the neuro remains profoundly neurotypical.
