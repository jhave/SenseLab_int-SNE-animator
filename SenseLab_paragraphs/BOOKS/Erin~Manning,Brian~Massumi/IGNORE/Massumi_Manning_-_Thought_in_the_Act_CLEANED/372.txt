Dancing the Virtual was successful in the sense that it did  create a momentum beyond itself, toward the next phase of  experimentation. Collaborations began to take form that extended beyond Montreal. A second event bringing the energies back to Montreal was planned for 2007. Housing the Body,  Dressing  the Environment organized itself around a different, but closely related, question from that of the first  event. The  refrain for this event was  a  phrase borrowed from the architects/conceptual artists Arakawa and Madeline Gins: “What emanates  from the body and what emanates from the architectural surround intermixes” (2002, 61). The  area  of  exploration was  the way  in which the potentials expressed through embodied movement—and in their “return as  the movement of  thought”—exfoliate  spaces of  relation that settle into architectural form. Body and built surround were treated as phase-shifts of the same process: forms of life taking architectural form, their movements and potentials returning like an echo of the architectural surround to co-causal effect. For this event, generative feedback between movement on the one hand, and architecture and interactive spatial design on the other, played the role of the central organizing node that the interplay between corporeal and incorporeal or abstract movements had fulfilled for Dancing the Virtual.
