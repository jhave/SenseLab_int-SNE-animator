Movement only comes from movement (Spinoza). Movement is sui generis: all and only in and of its own order (its own nexus). Language is likewise sui generis: words only come from other words, in recurring waves, rising and falling from the linguistic any-point of the superposition of sound and speech, and of silence and noise. The  same goes  for vision, in its own difference, at its dedicated any-point (Paul Kleeâ€™s grey  point where light and shadow, hue and illumination, enter into a zone of indistinction, and clarity  of reflection clouds back into a spray of refraction, rebecoming pure optical array).12
Language cannot fully describe movement. Movement does not give itself over to the order of language, any more than it surrenders itself integrally to visible form. The orders of experience are incommensurable. There is always a residue, a holding itself in reserve, each in its own element. At the extreme, each order suspends itself in its own reserve potential: in the trace of a last foretracing many a next, in a zone of indistinction. Each order is self-tracing. In the middle, they splay together in their difference. Absolutely amodally, in the dynamic concert of nonsensuous similarity.
