If capitalism is a universal process of capture, there is no simple way out. All activities are at some point, in some way,  taken up in it. But if capitalism is also  singularly inventive of new forms of relation, then despite this complicity there are emergent forms of life always on the make that might come to assert greater autonomy. The  result can be leakage in the systemâ€”lines of flight toward a noncapitalist future. Lines of flight are  immanent critiques of capitalism in action.
