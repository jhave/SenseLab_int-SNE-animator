“Sometimes two paintings from different series based on the same image call  to each other” (Ettinger 2010). The  artist may then move from one painting to another, brushstroking the painting “in relation to part of the last  painting that was set aside to move to the present one” (Ettinger 2010). This is done without direct visual reference. Not by gaze. It is not the look that transfers the face  from one painting to another.7 The  painting’s figures are allowed to resonate in each other, through the material operations of the painting process to which they mutually, serially belong. The figures transfer themselves, in the process. This  is not the artist’s volition. “The same face  may appear,” under transformation, “in  different parts of different paintings. The  faces  are  transconnected. Figures get  lost, then are refound in a different place” (Ettinger 2010).
