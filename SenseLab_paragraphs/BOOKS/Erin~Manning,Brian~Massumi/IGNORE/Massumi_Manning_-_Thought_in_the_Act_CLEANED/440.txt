The  capitalist economy is not only a universal process of subsuming all  forms of value to monetary valuation. It also  formally builds into its definition of value an imperative to quantitative value-adding. Capital is, by  definition, money that grows more money. The capitalist economy is formally dedicated to quantitative growth, over and above all  other values. Capitalist techniques of  relation are,  without exception, mechanisms of accumulation.
