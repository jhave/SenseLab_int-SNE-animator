Now turn to da  Vinci and take note that friends do  not necessarily resemble one another. In  St. John the  Baptist, it is more difficult to overlook the form, the figure, the face.  How could this salient figure in Ettingerâ€™s  incessant disappearing of  the figure? But  look again. Note where the figure is placed on the canvas. In fact, St. John the Baptist is not in the center. The  background occupies the center. Note how the figure frames the background, the head to the left  and the finger to the right. What is it framing? It is framing the intensely unseen, or  with-seen of the background foregrounding. Caught in this vibration, the figure is no doubt as much light as form or face.
