Where the bodying is a thinking in movement, most intensely and alive, is in movement extracted from action in this sensorimotor sense. “Subtract” the action, Forsythe tells  his  dancers (2011,  Nov. 17). “We  start out with a process and try to collapse it,”  he continues (2011,  Nov. 23).  Collapse movement back into itself. Subtract the general meaning from it.  Undo it of its preestablished adaptations. Return it to its gestural nexus. Give  it a more complex logic. Point-field it.  Don’t chain positions, chain sensations. Return the making of movement to the immediacy of its feeling. In that feeling, a different, more intense, utterly singular thinking will occur.
Where the body is most immediately thinking-movement is not in the unfolding of body schema. It is in its  folding back into itself, back into the dynamic nexus of its native gestural element. Not unfolding, but infolding. A turning back around onto itself to begin again, never taking leave of itself, never ending. A turning, a twisting, in: inflection. Movement returns to itself in its each and every inflection. With every twist, it contracts back into its own element, to rebegin. Forsythe calls  this the “centerpoint” of movement (2011, Nov. 10). This centerpoint of movement is unlike the centerpoint of vision. It is not a focal point but an any-point. Not a focused center but a many-vectored point-field. At this inflection point, movement contracts back into its own “dynamic difference” (Forsythe 2011, Nov. 23), the differential gestural nexus where it is wholly and only in its element.
