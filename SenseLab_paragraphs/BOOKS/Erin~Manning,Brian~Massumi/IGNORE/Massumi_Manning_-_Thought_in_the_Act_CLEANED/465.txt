The gift of giving touches the limit. The “last” gift is the limit in relation to which to the field  of exchangeability maintains its rhythm and intensity.  In  potlatch, giving reorients the field  of relations without forcing a complete undermining of the communities’ modalities of operation. In tribal societies, the gift brings clans together for a celebration. The potlatch wards off war  by staging an activity that, like war,  is excessive, but unlike war  activates the limit of the social field  without crossing the threshold into violence and completely unforeseeable consequences. Ritual plays a key role here, creating an experiential space-time that diverges from, while still composing with, everyday experience. Without the metastability of ritual,  without the practices that creatively reassess the limit from within the bounds of the event itself, there is always a risk that the threshold will be crossed into a different field of relation entirely. (The destruction of objects of exchange also  wards off capitalism by preventing the accumulation of a surplus.) The  giving of the event is how this technique of relation activates emergent comings-together and belongings-together, subordinating the categories of donor and receiver to their continued co-involvement in a shared process. A gift economy is not about the object. It is about Klee’s line: the polyrhythmic force of  expression that sustains and modulates living-together, intuitively resisting calculation.
