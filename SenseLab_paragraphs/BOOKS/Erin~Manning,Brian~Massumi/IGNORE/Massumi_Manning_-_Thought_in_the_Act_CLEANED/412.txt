Standard forms for  the sharing of work—conference, artist’s talk, demo, exhibition, festival—operate according to generic templates. Each  genre assumes a certain spatial disposition, time parameters, rhythms of transition, and modalities of interaction. The  generic template is not unvarying, but sets  recognizable limits to acceptable variation. Embedded in the genre is a certain understanding of how a work comes to experience. This  includes what Jacques Rancière calls  a “distribution of the sensible” (2005). Particular combinations  of  sense modes tend to be  privileged above others, typically with one dominant sense foregrounded. The dominant sensory mode, combined with spatial, temporal, and transitional formattings, creates an economy of attention and emphasis that amounts to a value system. Implicit and explicit value judgments are  thus primed into the event. Certain moments, and certain contributing factors, gain stature over others. The  same is true of the people involved. The  various distributive operations of the genre function primarily to assign differentially weighted roles to those involved (from the invisibility of building and technical staff to the overexposure of the star artist or academic to the backgrounded centrality of the audience’s watching—to limit the examples  to the visual).
