If the point-field of movement is nonlocalizable, when a dancer seeks to generate a movement it is not enough to get  into position. Position is the gateway to movement. But it is not of its order. Position is of the fixed spatial order. Movement’s order is of the always dynamically passing. “A move,” Forsythe reminds his  dancers, “is not so possessed of a place that you can’t find another.” “Keep in touch with the motion. Give  up your position” (Forsythe 2011, Nov. 8).
