In  the course of preparing Dancing the Virtual, we came to realize that we  had embarked upon a highly technical process that could not function purely through free improvisation. This  led to the emphasis on a certain notion of structured improvisation building on enabling constraints: “enabling” because in and of itself a constraint does not necessarily provoke techniques for process, and “constraint” because in and of itself openness does not create the conditions for collaborative exploration.
Setting up techniques of relation conditioned by enabling constraints facilitating co-generation of effects is a thorough and exacting process. It involved, in the case of Dancing the Virtual and all our subsequent events, a full year’s preparation. A technique, in all creative practices, from dance to art  to writing and reading, involves practiced repetition and intensive exchange. In  the context of  an event that seeks  to create a generative encounter between different modalities of practice, a technique involves activating a passage between creative forces.
