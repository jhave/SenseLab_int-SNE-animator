Woolf Phrase’s  visionary quality creates a suspension, a lingering in the future-forming moment. She,  movement-mewling. He,  again sitting toward the edge, watching her, waiting. This holding pattern, cut by touch, reset—PAAF!—circles the piece around itself, somehow. Two velocities are continuously at work, two modes in attention, two levels—language and movement—in counterpoint. This doubling keeps the piece active, alive at the limit of what movement and language, in their differential, are capable of. One register alone, if given dominance, would dampen the force of what is at work here. We might look for Meaning instead of heeding the call  to attention to movement-moving. We  might catch ourselves seeing Mrs Dalloway told, in movement. Illustration, representation redux. But this is not what is happening. A thirdness is coming into play, in the elemental  force of the two, one-two, coming together. This  thirdness contracted, always, through the creative disjunction of the match-flow and its reset.
What do  language and movement do,  at this limit where they refract into thirdness? They remake themselves at the edge of time, where time itself is at the limit of its spiraling. Time folds. in. Ever. Widening. Circles. Life and death in co-composition, in the shape of a wave cresting. stricken. leaden. Circles.
