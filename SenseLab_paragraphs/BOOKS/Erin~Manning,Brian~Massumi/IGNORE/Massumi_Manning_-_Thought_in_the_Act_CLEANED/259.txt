Drift to white. White appears, increasingly, in the No Title Yet series  (2003–
10). In No Title Yet, No. 3—Eurydice, St Anne it reaches the point that cloudlike wafts of white trouble traces of figuration inherited from earlier series. The  whiteness stands out from the trace-forms, and at the same time recedes from them. The standing out and receding back of white does not sandwich the trace-forms between two layers. It veins through them. They are suspended in the movement of white’s foregrounding backgrounding itself. The trace-forms are suspended in this movement. They shiver with it, it mists them. They vibrate in the activity of white’s self-relating, a ceaseless movement going nowhere else.
