It was precisely this sense that research-creation was troubled from birth that we took as our starting point. What if we started over? What if we took the hyphenation seriously, seeing it as an internal connectionâ€”a mutual interpenetration of processes rather than a communication of products? This  approach would posit research-creation as a mode of activity all  its own, occurring at the constitutive level  of both art  practice and theoretical research, at a point before research and creation diverge into the institutional structures that capture and contain their productivity and judge them by conventional criteria for added value. At that prebifurcation level, making would already be thinking-in-action, and conceptualization a practice  in its own right. The  two, we proposed, would intersect in technique, technique understood here as an engagement with the modalities of expression a practice invents for itself. Our speculative starting point was that this meeting in technique, to be truly creative, would have to be constitutively open ended. The  kind of results aimed at would not be preprogrammed. They would be experimental, emergent effects of an ongoing process.
