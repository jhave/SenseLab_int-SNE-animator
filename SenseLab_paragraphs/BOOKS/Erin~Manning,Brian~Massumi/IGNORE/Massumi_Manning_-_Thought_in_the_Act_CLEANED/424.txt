In  the second phase, the group will  descend upon the SAT in Montreal for the setup and activation of the exploded gallery. The  occupation of the SAT will  last  three days. At a certain point, when the sought-after emergent attunement among the disparate activities co-habiting the eventspace has  emerged, the event will  be  opened to the public, who will  be invited to actively participate. Defining what constitutes an attunement, and what modality of  public participation will  be  enabled, will  be  the main challenges of the participantsâ€™ self-organizing over the two phases of the event.
