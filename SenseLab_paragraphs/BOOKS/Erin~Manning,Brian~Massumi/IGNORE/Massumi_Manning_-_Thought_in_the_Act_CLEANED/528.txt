An endeavor is at its most inventive when decision making works as a cut  in a process that enables new forms of collectivity to emerge in a next unfolding phase. For this to work well  it is necessary that actions embody a “concern for  the event,” and that an atmosphere and ethos has  been generated that sustains that concern. Much work must go into enabling the event to do  its own work, such that it is the global momentum of the event  itself  that is followed and fed.  This  momentum may at times channel  through an act  or decision of a particular individual or subgroup. But it is not owned by them. It channels through them, such that no one in particular can take ultimate credit for anything that happens. In the end, it is only the event that is a credit to itself. exploding the city?
