“Where does the movement start and stop?” (Forsythe 2011, Nov. 10). What manner of phrasing is native to movement, in its disjunctively synthesizable difference from language and from other registers of experience? This is the core question around which Forsythe organizes his company’s choreographic process and to which he never ceases to return. He has  returned to it now, in November 2011, in prerehearsal for the upcoming season. A new piece is to be created from scratch and old  ones revived. Included in the revivals is Woolf Phrase, which will be performed after a long hiatus. New dancers have joined the company and are  being inducted into its movement generation techniques. They likely already know the answer to the question, as would anyone familiar with Forsythe’s dance vocabulary and practice: it “starts from any point” . . . and stops at any other (Caspersen 2011, 94; Caspersen 2000, 33; Forsythe 2012).
