As-if
The motional-relational in the mode of the what-if is futurity in movement. What-if: the body folds, extremely fast,  too fast  for  any subject to think it.  What-if: cueing to movement sprays, we activate a collective bodying that alters the affective tonality not only of the movement itself, but of the rhythmic milieu. What-if: a curve is thrown that cannot be predicted in its particulars, precisely because it has  been relationally imbued with futurity, fielding itself into novel form.
