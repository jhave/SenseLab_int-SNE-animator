The  intercessor is a tending-forth, a force of expression without peer. It comes from the outside, attracted by conditions for  its shaping. Coming in, it shifts the work toward its own uneasy outside. This  outside is intensive,  tightly wound in its interloping, in the interweaving of elastic relations with all else incipiently in-act.
