The  polyrhythmic heterogeneity of  the creative co-factors entering this economyâ€™s composition retain their individual resonant tenor as subprocesses in their own right, even as they enter into dynamic relations of attunement. They attune through the research-creation process, without abdicating their power to also  iterate autonomously and to self-affirm. Research-creation as we propose to practice it is a polyrhythmic attuning of mutually composing autonomous activities that collectively resist definitive capitalist capture and affirm value in terms that cannot be quantified.
