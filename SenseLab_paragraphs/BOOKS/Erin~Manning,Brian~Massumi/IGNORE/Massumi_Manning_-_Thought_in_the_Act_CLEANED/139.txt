In  2001, the Forsythe Company created Woolf Phrase,1  a piece conceived from Virginia Woolf’s novel Mrs Dalloway, generated, as Forsythe says,  by “moving around the rhythm of Woolf’s language” (Sulcas 2001). From its conception, the piece is about movement and language coming together and in relay. Its project: to make a movement phrase of the movement of Woolf’s phraseology.
