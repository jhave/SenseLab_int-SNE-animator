In the year leading up to Society of Molecules,31 a number of enabling constraints were  collectively brainstormed. Building on our planning conversations with the folks  in Sydney, Australia, we knew that the global event would consist of correlated local events. Each  local event would creatively address a “politico-aesthetic” issue  felt  by  local participants to affect the quality of their lives.  The “politico-” element referred to formative or organizational forces that were  active in each local environment, but extended beyond it in a way  that placed them in connection with other locales. Examples might be:  forces of redevelopment or  economic stimulus that palpably changed the culture of the city; forces propelling or responding to the movement of people across borders; environmental  issues as they play out locally; issues of urban planning and the conviviality of public spaces; and the potential local derelict spaces offer  for alternative cultural initiatives adapting strategies from other emplacements or linking into earlier political movements for local empowerment. Our proposition was that these larger forces be addressed from the specific angle of their local effect, but in cognizance of their wider significance and with an active attempt to bring their translocal dimension differently into play.
