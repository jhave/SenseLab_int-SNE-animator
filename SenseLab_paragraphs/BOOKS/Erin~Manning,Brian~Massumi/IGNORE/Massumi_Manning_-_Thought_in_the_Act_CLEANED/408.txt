To ensure that this contribution also adds to the ongoing self-reinvention of the SenseLab, the approach the SenseLab has  developed up to now will be turned on its head, in keeping with our exhortation to practice letting go. For each of our previous events, participants were  asked to bring only their techniques and to leave their products behind, so that the meeting would occur at the level  of the work’s technicity and its intensive capacity  to propagate and vary. The  space of  encounter was  always carefully conditioned and enabling constraints set in place. This  time, on the contrary, we will ask people to come with all the products—papers, artworks, thoughts, ideas—that it pleases them to bring, as well  as their techniques. As a further challenge, this cacophony will  not be organized in advance: except renting a campground in the forest for all participants for five days (July 3–7, 2011) and directing our work toward the space of the SAT for the following three days (July 8–10, 2011), nothing will be done in advance to prepare the space of experimentation. One key  enabling constraint will be the very  injunction to begin the event under conditions of chaos, then move the event through a process of self-organization toward an “emergent attunement.”
