The  work of  Ettinger’s evolving painting  process will  be  to cast  this machinic-material dynamic of image-forming light back into a perceptual dynamic—still off the axes  of spectatorial perception and authorial volition, on an axis of light, immanent to the image-forming process. The artist characterizes that axis as “spiritual,” suggesting that a new meaning would have to be imagined for that word, independent of its religious connotations.3 For her painting process has  no more to do with “enlightenment” than with illumination. When the found images move into the subsequent stages of the image-forming process, the rebeginning play of light between toner and drum continues in a form-finding interplay between color and white. The  image emerging from the photocopier is now consigned to brushwork. Colors cloud, drifting as they shift. Whites come and go, into hue and out. Their movement is not governed by any direct application of  principles of  composition. It  continues to emerge, in a manner that can still  be called machinic—if that word can be used for a form-coming that occurs in a suspension of authorial will  and spectatorial perception, in relation to an outside of those axes, immanent to the painting process.
