Deleuze and Guattari give  the example of trading for  axes  in a tribal society. If the penultimate is passed and the limit actually reached, there will  be a surplus of axes. When the surplus is absorbed, a transition will necessarily occur to a new assemblage—a new form of warfare or  a new form of agricultural production. An entire way of life will be transformed. The reaching of the limit is the passing of a qualitative threshold to a new collective form of life featuring new kinds of activity. The punctual equivalence realized in a given trade between individuals is a function of a qualitative evaluation ultimately bearing on a collective form of life. The object of the evaluation is less the thing exchanged than the relational field of activity into which the object is inserted. The qualitative evaluation of the limit is the organizing principle of a field  of relation that immanently informs every punctual event belonging to the field, and sustains them all. What is at stake is less the equivalence between the objects exchanged than the sustenance of their relational field of exchangeability, within certain qualitative parameters. The limit idea is the economic expression of a collective ideal: the desirability of a form of life.  This  is not a transcendent ideal. It operates immanently to the events it concerns. Uncrossed, the limit is a sustaining factor in the serial production of new iterations of events in the same qualitative field. If it is crossed, it will have been a generative factor in a “necessary rebeginning” (1987, 438).  Either way,  it is a creative factor.
