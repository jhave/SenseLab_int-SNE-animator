In the aftermath of the eventâ€™s reorientation to its loss of a starting point, there came the necessity to find an organizational strategy conducive to nonhierarchical,  collective self-organizing that could at the same time offer  the mutual aid  that might be necessary for  life outside the city  and create the continuity that would be needed to keep the event together as it shifted from the forest back to the city.
Originally used by anarchists during the Spanish Civil War, the affinitygroup structure has  become a key organizational tool for nonhierarchical social movements, passing through the antinuclear movements of  the 1970s and 1980s, into the antiglobalization movement of the early 2000s, and most recently into the Occupy Movement of 2011. An affinity group is an autonomous decision-making unit, usually composed of five to fifteen people, networked horizontally. Its purpose is to distribute decision making transversally across a larger group without resorting to a central authority structure.
