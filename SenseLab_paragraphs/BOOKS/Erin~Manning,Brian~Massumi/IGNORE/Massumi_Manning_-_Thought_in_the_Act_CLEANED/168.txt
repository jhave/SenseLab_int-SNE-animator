To the extent that it unfolds from a recognition according to a logic, a sensorimotor habit is a kind of  thought in action  automatically executed, below the threshold of conscious awareness. But action is of a different order than movement as such, as in dance. What defines action, as opposed to movement, is that its execution is swaddled less immediately in rhythm, than it is mediated by preestablished meaning. In habit, the body moves into what today’s situation has recognizably in common with yesterday’s, and what this sameness in the situation means for  the stomach. A sensorimotor habit is a general idea of the body. The  meaning  is always adaptive: this repeated sequence fits  the general situation, as it did  before and will again.
