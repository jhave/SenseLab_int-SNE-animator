When all is said  and done, the conversation will  have had a different lived quality for  each participant. But  it will  still  have been strictly the same speech event. This is attunement: a polyrhythmic coming-differentlytogether through the same event, carrying the event’s field  of emergence through its  unfolding, in such a way  that its  having happened becomes a co-condition for  what follows—without in any way  modeling it.  Each new conversation will  have to start all  over again, under altered initial conditions, from the field  of  emergence of  language. Each  subsequent conversation will  carry the field  of  emergence through itself in its  own reimprovised way,  to new polyrhythmic effect, expressing a lived quality singularly its  own. Each  conversation will  happen not in the individual bodies of the participants, but in the relational unfoldings of its actual and potential expressions.
For Generating the Impossible, we emphasize “emergent” attunement to underline the impersonal aspect of attunement: the field  of (to  return to the same example) conversational relation as a self-extending, indefinite social “surface.” We  conceive of research-creation similarly: as an indefinite “surface” of relation rippled by previous SenseLab events. The field of conversation includes an infinity of factors, other than language narrowly defined. Its cresting in language makes it a speech event, and yet it carries in germ an infinity of other incipient event species.
