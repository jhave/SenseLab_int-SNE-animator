Somehow . . . music. Forsythe Company composer Thom Willems has created a sound surround. As Forsythe says,  Willems gives  the performers an “acoustic space to dance” (Forsythe 2003a). The undulating of the music is the space of the movement. The piece takes place in this rhythmic space, more so than on the stage. The stage is just the launching pad. Everything that will be seen, heard, sounded, spoken, gestured, and evoked will collect in the rhythmic milieu hovering above, wrapping around.3  Everything will belong to it,  everything will  collect in it,  swaddled together in its  undulations. For everything has  rhythm, and rhythms have a way  of coming together. They resonate and accrue. Twists and turns and turns of phrase, inflections of movement and of language, will  assemble and accrete, to compose this piece. Just like that.
From the first moment, a space of mutual envelopment is set in place. It would be  more precise to say  that a milieu of mutual envelopment is activated. It takes, it is set,  set  alight. The  set  itself, the literal stage space and the things it holds—bodies, costumes, microphones—are but the kindling. The  activation is between registers. It is set  acoustically as well  as linguistically, as speakingly as movingly, as much in sound effect as in the vocalization of words, in gesture as in intonation. What is activated envelops  the difference between these registers, as well  as between the events occurring on each, folding into rhythm. Waves collect. overbalance. and fall, he words.
