The  Technologies of Lived  Abstraction event series  was  always destined to co-compose with, and around, capitalist capture, to invent new lines of flight or  reinforce existing ones, for  a lived glimpse of a noncapitalist economy. This  is why we  started the present discussion with an evocation of  the neoliberal economic context. The  SenseLab’s Technologies of Lived Abstraction event series  was  always under an immanent imperative to return explicitly to the problem of economies. This  was done from the start by deemphasizing the product in favor of experimentation with collaborative creative process as a value in itself. Ultimately, the “impossibility”  that is the aim of its culminating event is to contribute, in however small and faltering a way,  to metamodeling a noncapitalist alter-economy of creative relation.
