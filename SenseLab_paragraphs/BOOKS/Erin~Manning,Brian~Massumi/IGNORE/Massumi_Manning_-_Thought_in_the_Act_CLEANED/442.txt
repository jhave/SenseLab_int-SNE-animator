It is important not to mistake this capture for a homogenization. The forms of  life  captured by  the capitalist process produce value by  distinguishing themselves from each other. Capitalism is as singularizing as it is subsuming. The issue  is that the singularization is subject to competition in a way  that foregrounds quantitative measures of success over the richness of qualitative diversity. The heterogeneity of forms of life is important only to the extent that those forms add capital value. Although the capitalist process creates the conditions for  the singular emergence of forms of life  and feeds off their heterogeneity, it ultimately attributes no value to them as such. It is supremely indifferent to the qualitative richness that animates its field.
Recent currents in Marxist-inspired thought analyze the phenomenon of singularization and heterogenesis animating the contemporary capitalist process in terms of “immaterial labor.” The idea is that in a “knowledge economy,” forms of  creative cooperation are  invented to feed  the new informational market. These collaborative processes compose new forms of relational life.  Given that they are processes of cooperation, they have a potential for self-organization. Under certain circumstances, they might succeed in decoupling from the dominant system of valuation to affirm the value of their self-propagating events in their own terms. Movements like  open source, peer-to-peer sharing, and tools for  collective web-based authorship are seen as harbingers of this, particularly to the degree to which they become self-affirming “ways of life.” When this happens, they potentially co-compose the beginnings of an alter-economy. This  foretokens an overcoming of capitalism from the inside out, in a playing out of one of capitalism’s own immanent tendencies—that of creatively productive collaborative relation.
