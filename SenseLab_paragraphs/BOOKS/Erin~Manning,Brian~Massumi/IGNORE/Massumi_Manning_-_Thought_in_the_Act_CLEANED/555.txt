5.   Note that “intercessor” in Deleuze (1995)  is mistranslated into English as
“mediator.”
6.   On this “deterritorializing” function of the face,  see Deleuze and Guattari, “Faciality” (1987, 167–91).
7.   In Massumi (2006), the movement of the gaze was analyzed as constitutive. This  function of the gaze is tied to the interplay of light and dark that organizes the Eurydice series. The  coming to prominence of the interplay between transparency and white in the No Title  Yet series passes through this phase, to move beyond the gaze.  As if accidentally, this shift largely corresponds to the artist’s studio moving from Paris, where the paintings descended and ascended between the light of the studio space and the darkness of the basement, to Tel Aviv,  where they participate in the relation of the studio to its outside, as described earlier.
8.   The translation has  been modified to conform to the wording of this phrase as quoted in Deleuze (1986,  93).
9.   On all these points, see “The Brightness Confound” (Massumi 2002, 162–
76) and “The Diagram as Technique of Existence” (Massumi 2011, 87–194).
10.   Deleuze is specifically describing the “qualitative face” as it appears in a scene of Josef  von Sternberg’s cinematography. Deleuze terms the anti-expressionism of light’s adventure with white “lyrical abstraction” (1986,  116–17).
11.   In our first chapter (“Coming Alive in a World of Texture”), we wrote of the coinciding of experience with imagination. Here, imagination is being used in a more restricted sense, as traditionally understood as being an act  of a separate subject.
