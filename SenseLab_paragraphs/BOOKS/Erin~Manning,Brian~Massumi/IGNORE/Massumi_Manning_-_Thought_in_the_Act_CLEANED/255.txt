This  reinaugural light interaction proceeds unseen into the forming painting. It is not even seen at this stage by  the painter, other than as a passing flash that dazzles perception rather than enabling it.  The  painter herself does not have the axis. The  reinaugural gesture of flipping the switch dispossesses her of her painterly will.  Her  aesthetic choice has  also  been consigned to the machine. Authorial volition, no less than spectatorial perception, is challenged by an anonymous light suspending both the origin and the destination of the painting process. A light that is not cast  on the image to illuminate it, but actively casts the image, from within the process of its formation. An activity of light that rebegins the image, immanent to its formative process.
