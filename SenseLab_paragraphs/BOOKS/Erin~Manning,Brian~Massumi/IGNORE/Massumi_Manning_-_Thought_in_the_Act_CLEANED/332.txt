At the heart of Montrealâ€™s Quartier des Spectacles lies the Society for Art and
Technology (SAT).11  The SAT grew from a successful organizing effort on the part of key  personalities in the budding electronic music and digital arts community of Montreal toward hosting the international symposium of the Inter-Society for Electronic Arts (Montreal, 1995).12 From this seed, it has grown over the years into a central institution in the arts-and-culture mix of Montreal and become a magnet institution in the Quartier des Spectacles, all the while taking care to retain its community-based ethos and openness to experimentation. Its activities have expanded to include research programs into new design practices, the creation of digital platforms in partnership with independent producers as well as university-based researchers, technical training programs for  cultural producers, cohosting of arts  festivals, organization of public lecture series  and colloquia, and projects to reconceive the form and function of the art  gallery and to reconceptualize the documenting and archiving of interactive and ephemeral forms of creative expression.
