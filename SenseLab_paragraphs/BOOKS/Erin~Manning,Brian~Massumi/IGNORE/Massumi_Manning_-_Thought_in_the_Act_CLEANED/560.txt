17.   The  first  issue of the SenseLab’s online  journal  was  dedicated to the question of research-creation, with contributions from a number of SenseLab event participants. See “How Is Research Creation?,” special issue edited by  Alanna Thain, Christoph Brunner, and Natasha Prevost, Inflexions: A Journal for Research Creation, no. 1 (May 2008), http://www.inflexions.org.
18.   Dancing  the   Virtual,  http://www.dancingthevirtual.blogspot.com.  The call  for  participation is  available at http://senselab.ca/wp2/events/dancing-the
-virtual-2005/. Thirty participants were chosen on the basis  of  their response to the call,  which brought the total to forty, including the core SenseLab committee. Invited participants included those listed at http://senselab.ca/wp2/participants/.
19.   On the concept of the movement of thought, see “Conclusion: Propositions for Thought in Motion” (Manning 2009, 213–28).
20.   The  movement exploration for this event was  “relational movement.” For a more detailed exploration of this movement practice, see “Incipient Action: The Dance of the Not-Yet” (Manning 2009, 13–28).
21.   Despite the lack of funding, everyone who committed to Dancing the Virtual attended and, with the exception of two participants, returned for the subsequent event, Housing the  Body,  Dressing  the  Environment. Certain eligible components  of subsequent events were funded by grants from the SSHRC.
22.   We  make a distinction between “relationality” and interactivity based on the mode of causality (co-causal and fostering emergence of the new in the first case, and linear and reproductive of function in the second). On this distinction, see “The Thinking-Feeling of What Happens” (Massumi 2011, 39–86).
23.   A Basecamp grouphub was  set  up for  online interaction in advance of the event.
24.   On the concept of the terminus, see “The Ether and Your  Anger: Toward a
Speculative Pragmatism” (Massumi 2011, 29–38).
25.   On the need for “sobriety,” see Deleuze and Guattari (1987, 279).
26. See  http://senselab.ca/wp2/events/housing-the-body-dressing-theenvironment-2007/.
27.   The  concept was  proposed by  Owen Chapman, who has continued to work with the “ice  xylophone” in his  own artwork (http://www.opositive.ca/files/ opositive.html).
28.   Other platforms included “Into the Night,” “Dancing the Environment,” “Becoming Responsive,” “Fashioning Skins,” and the already mentioned “Around Architecture” and “Sound Surrounds.” There were also three food-related platforms, one organized for each evening.
