The goal was in no way to reach agreement among participants on philosophical issues concerning movement, the virtual, and embodiment. The goal, rather, was to stage those issues, live, in the on-site interaction, to see if the interfusion of concept-work and embodied interaction would bring something new to participantsâ€™ practices, on the level  of their own techniques or their techniques for joining their practice with those of others. Actual movement exercises were  part of the activities.20 Philosophers were asked to put their thinking into movement, at the same time as dancers/ choreographers were  asked to move with their thinking (to  mention just the two practices present that were  most directly connected to the pivotal question of the event).
