“That which is being apportioned out is in the process of landing” (AG
2002, 5). The  site is in the process of apportioning itself out as the body is apportioning itself to it. The  site  lands itself for the body as much as the body lands the site.  The  site stretches between in a single, two-way movement of potential. Do not presume to know concretely where the person who makes architectural-body sense lies. She lies in the field of her potential. “We  cannot define where a body begins and where external nature ends” (Whitehead 1968,  21).
