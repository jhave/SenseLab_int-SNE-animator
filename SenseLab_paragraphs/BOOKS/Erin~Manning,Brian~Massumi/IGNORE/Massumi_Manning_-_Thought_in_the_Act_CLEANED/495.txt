The  previous chapter, Propositions for Thought in the Act, was written as an invitation to voyage. Its purpose was to convey a terrain collectively traveled, in preparation for a coming foray. It was addressed to fellow travelers already in the SenseLab network, and to others who might be inspired to come aboard. It was  a kind of conceptual bill  of lading attesting to what was coming in the collective baggage, not as an anchor to a particular past, but more as a flotation device for the next lap.  In  its own terms, it was a platform for relation for the open-ended continuation of a journey.
