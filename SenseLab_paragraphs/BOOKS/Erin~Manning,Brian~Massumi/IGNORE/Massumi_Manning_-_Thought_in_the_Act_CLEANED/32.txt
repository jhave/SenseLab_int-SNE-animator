One never writes alone. As Deleuze and Guattari say, one writing alone is already a crowd. Our words in this book are never without the echoes of the voices of those whose difference we chose to write with. Not to mention the moves, gestures, colors, architectures, and events of the creative practices we  encountered. A veritable cacophony. Or  better: an ecology. Composing each of the chapters involved reinventing our techniques for writing together in a way that could distill from the cacophonous ecology of our experiences together a shared line of thought, one that we  hope has  done justice to the thinkings-in-the-act that we  have had the good fortune to experience firsthand through residencies and interactions with creative practitioners.
