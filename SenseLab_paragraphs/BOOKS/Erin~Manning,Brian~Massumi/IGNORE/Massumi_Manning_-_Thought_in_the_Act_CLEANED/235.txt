Touch resets the any-point of movement. By calling attention to the any-point of movement, touch makes visible the incommensurability of the two, one, two,  one-two. Watch them  move: note how the touch  activates a slowing, an intensive attending, not only to that through which relational movement moves, but to the shape of  the work as a moving whole, to the shape of  its  sidling to language and contorting to movement. Watch how touch acts  on movement, stilling its delirium. But note also  how its stalling of movement works to make apparent what, following  Proust, we  might call  movement’s witch’s line, its  capacity to upset the dominant code that seeks  only to generalize experience. The  touch is unnerving—it undoes expectation, refusing to connect the two in an easy intimacy. Touch: giving the viewer, the dancer, the bearings from whence to start again, differently, in the middle. For what moves is not one dancer connecting with another. What moves is a moving in the middling, a collective moving-with that connects to movement’s visionary potential, in a nexus with language.
