This co-compositional engagement with the associated milieu of emergent relation is an environmental mode  of awareness. It is a mode of existence integral, for  autistics, to all  aspects of  experience. They do  not bemoan this modality of awareness as a deficit but affirm it as a mode  of existence  intertwined tendentially with other modes of existence, such as those (more “human” by the neurotypical definition) that are  centered on language.
