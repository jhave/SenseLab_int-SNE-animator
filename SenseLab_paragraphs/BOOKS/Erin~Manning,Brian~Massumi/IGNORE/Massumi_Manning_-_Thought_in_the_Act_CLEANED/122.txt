In the pulsing of the person, “consciousness flickers; and even at its brightest, there is a small focal region of clear illumination, and a large penumbral region of experience which tells of intense experience in dim apprehension. The  simplicity of clear consciousness is no measure of the complexity of complete experience” (Whitehead 1978, 267).
