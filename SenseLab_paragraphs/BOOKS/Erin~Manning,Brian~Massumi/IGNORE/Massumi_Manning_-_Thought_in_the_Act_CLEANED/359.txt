1   A ban was set in place as regards presenting already-completed work of whatever kind. This  was not meant to imply that participants would enter as  blank slates. On the contrary, they were encouraged to bring everything but  completed work. They were encouraged to come with all  their passions, skills, methods, and, most of all, their techniques, but without a predetermined idea of  how these would enter into the Dancing the Virtual event. To encourage this, each participant was asked to bring something essential to his  or her practice as an offering  to the group: an object, a material, a keyword, a conceptual formula, a technical system. This  relational technique was dubbed the “(Im)material Potluck.” The offerings would be kept on hand as a resource base for  the event and would be called on improvisationally as needed and desired. Their immediate function would be  as a gift  to the group, as well  as a kind of calling card expressing something about the person and his or her practice. This  would facilitate entry into group interaction from the angle not of who someone was (their status in a field, their recognized achievements, the territory their achievements staked out for  them) but rather of  what moved them. What moved each participant became a potential co-cause of group movements in the making.
