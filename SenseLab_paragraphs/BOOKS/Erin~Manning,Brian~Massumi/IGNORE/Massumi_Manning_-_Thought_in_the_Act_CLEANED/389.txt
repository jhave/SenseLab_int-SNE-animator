Starting from discussions with Australian SenseLab members Andrew Murphie30  and Lone Bertelsen, the beginning of a new distributive mechanism was  proposed that would seek  to spark locally rooted collaborative intensities across the globe. The goal  of  our third event, Society  of Molecules, was  to find mechanisms and techniques that would allow us to mutually interact and influence one another, without the need for face-to-face encounter. The  SenseLab would go remote. The  problem was how to distribute self-organizing creative energies carrying potentially transformative force, while operatively interconnecting them at a distance: research-creation as action at a distance. Moving in that direction was  a necessary part of one of the SenseLabâ€™s larger goals: to contribute to a continuing collective culture dedicated to an ethics of engagement, operating on a larger scale  and conveying a power of contagion.
