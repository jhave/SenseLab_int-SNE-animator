Since  the goal  was  to collaboratively “catalyze” movement toward the emergence of the new, the role  of the techniques of relation would not be to “frame” the interaction in the traditional sense. The  techniques would be  for  implanting opportunities for  creative participation, which would be encouraged to take on their own shape, direction, and momentum in the course of the event. The  role  of the techniques of relation was to create conditions conducive to the event earning its name as an event. These techniques would have to be of two kinds: techniques to set in place propitious initial conditions, and techniques to modulate the event as it moved through its  phases. The  paradigm was  one of conditioning, rather than framing. The difference is that conditioning consists in bringing co-causes into interaction, such that the participation yields something different from either acting alone. The  reference is to complex emergent process, rather than programmed organization. Emergent process, dedicated to the singular occurrence of the new, agitates inventively in an open field. Programmed organization, on the other hand, functions predictably in a bounded frame and lends itself to reproduction.
