The  general approach and major orientations of  Dancing the  Virtual flowed over into Housing the Body. Many of the techniques of relation were reprised. The  model of hospitality was fed forward in the form of an invitation to all the participants of Dancing the Virtual to return for Housing the Body. With the exception of two, everyone returned, which condensed our capacity to welcome new participants to ten, for a total of fifty.26 As with the earlier event, a reading list was sent to the participants for online discussion in advance of the date to provide a pivot for concept-work and its integrative alternation with embodied and hands-on work, toward a collective practice of structured improvisation.
