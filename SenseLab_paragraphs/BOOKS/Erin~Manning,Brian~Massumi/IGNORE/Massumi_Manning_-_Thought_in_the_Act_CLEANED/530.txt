On our first evening back, The Mi(d)st was restrung in Saint-Viateur Park in Outremont across a small moat separating the perimeter of  the park from an island pavilion at its center. A security guard cooperatively turned a blind eye  while the netting was  installed and then came back later to “discover” the deed and fulfill his  duty to uphold city  permit regulations.
