As originally planned, we would start at the hunting camp at Mekoos, deep in the northern wilds 250 kilometers from Montreal. The  approach, however, would be  different than projected. Rather than starting from purposely unprepared, quasi-chaotic conditions, we would set conditions for structured improvisation in place as we had in the first three events. A number of platforms for relation would be used to catalyze the collective creative process in the forest setting toward the kind of emergent collective  attunement we had always envisioned for the event. Then we would break camp and head for the city. How could an emergent process catalyzing  in the woods be prolonged into the city? What does it mean to transduce a creative process from one set of enabling conditions to another? If the form, as well  as its content, changes in the interval of transduction, is it still  the same process? Can a forest-conditioned process renaturalize in and for  the city, in a way  that effectively brings something of the urban environment to expression, in creative relation to its ex-urban surrounds? Would that event constitute a contagion? A proliferation? A break? A variation? A tracing? Much discussion and preparation went into grappling with these issues. The  “diagram” (in  Gilles Deleuze’s sense) emerged as a pivot concept for  attempting to understand, speculative-pragmatically, what a transduction can do.
What follows is not meant in any way as a full account of the event in all its speculative-pragmatic facets. Its aim is modest: to provide a brief narrative account that gives  a summary sense of how the event took shape as it transduced its own initial sense of itself, as prospectively floated in the
