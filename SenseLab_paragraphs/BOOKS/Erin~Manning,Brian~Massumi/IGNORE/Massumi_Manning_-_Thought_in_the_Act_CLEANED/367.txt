This principle was also used to self-organize the first division of the participants into small work groups. Elements within the space were  draped with colorful fabrics of  alluring textures (primarily fake  furs). To  divide the group, participants were  asked to move to the fabric attractor that most spoke to them. The  resulting groups were  thus formed on the basis of affinity, a common affective tending, rather than preinstituted categories (rank, discipline, content area  of expertise). In Deleuze and Guattari’s vocabulary, this focused the unfolding of the event on “minor” tendential movements rather than “major” structural categories. The overall affective tonality participants were  tuned toward in their induction into the event was playfulness—play being the minor tendency contained by every instituted structure, whose unleashing softens or disables postural default settings. A degree of play creates the potential for the emergence of the new, not in frontal assault against structure but at the edges and in its pores.
