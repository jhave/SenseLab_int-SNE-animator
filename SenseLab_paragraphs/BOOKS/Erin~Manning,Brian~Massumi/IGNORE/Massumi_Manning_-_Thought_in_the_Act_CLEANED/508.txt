Certain affinity groups formed organically in the months before we left for Mekoos. Others were  formally struck. There was one decreed enabling constraint to their activities: while at Mekoos, each affinity group would prepare one evening meal (paid for by the SenseLab) for the entire group of fifty-four Generating the Impossible participants.3 The organization of food provision was to be a convivial mirror of the overall organizational structure, with the shared evening meals playing the role  of informal evening assemblies. The  planning for  meals was  a complex logistical task, especially since the remoteness of  the location made it unfeasible to source food once we were  on the ground (the nearest grocery store was an hour and a half away by car over country roads, some of which become impassible  when wet). The  collective food platform involved all participants in a logistics of mutual care  that it was hoped would color the overall ethos of the encounter.
