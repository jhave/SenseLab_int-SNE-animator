A co-poiesis is occurring here. Painter painted painting. Field  fielded fielding. The intercessor thresholding, differentializing. An ephemeral community at work not-yet-again, a coming community that attends to the fact that the outside is a threshold. “Not another space that resides beyond a determinate  space [but . . .] the passage, the exteriority that gives  it access—in a word [. . .] its face”  (Agamben 1993, 68).
