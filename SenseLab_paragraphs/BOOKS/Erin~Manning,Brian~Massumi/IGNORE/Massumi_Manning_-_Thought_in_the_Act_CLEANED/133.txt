An organism-that-persons: a perspective, a populated field  of alterantaltering interfusion that lands sometimes narrowly, sometimes widely. “Feeling is the agent which reduces the universe to its  perspective for fact. Apart from gradations of  feeling, the infinitude of  detail produces an infinitude of effect in the constitution of each fact” (Whitehead 1968, 10). Feeling, a perspective of the universe, a taking, a yielding; a figuring, a backgrounding. Feeling, how perspective concresces. Feeling, how importance fields. Feeling, the germ of expression where the many become one and are increased by one (Whitehead 1978, 21).
