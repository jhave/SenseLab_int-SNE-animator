In  the early years, we  chose to base  our projects at the SAT. Its  positioning at the heart of Montreal’s digital culture, coupled with its continued commitment to traditions of artistic experimentation and openness to community-based cultural activism, made it a resonating chamber for the tensions—and potentials—afoot in the complex, shifting context we have been describing. However reticent we were of the direction many developments in the larger neoliberal context were  taking, we felt a strong affinity with the creative energy and conceptual questioning at the heart of ventures initiated by the SAT, and were adamant about working in connection with community-based initiatives and not solely from the safe  haven of the university. We  were  not interested in simply taking a critical stance, as if as university-based researchers/artists we stood outside the situation and did not ourselves participate in the new economy and in our own way profit from it. We  wanted to work in the thick of the tensions—creative, institutional, urban, economic—and build out from them.
