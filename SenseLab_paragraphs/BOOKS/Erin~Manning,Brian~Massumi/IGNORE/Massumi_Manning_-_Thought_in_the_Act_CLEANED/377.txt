The  “Sound Surround” platform was one that resisted regrouping and ended up twice as large  (and twice as loud!). They proposed an invented instrument: a microphone embedded in ice.27 Various sounds of unusual quality could be  made by  percussing, caressing, or  shaving the ice.  The sounds of the melting ice dripping into a metal tray below were captured by another microphone. Both sound feeds were input into a computer, where they could be digitally mixed and altered. The challenge of the group proposing the platform was to explore the sonic potentials of this setup, what manner of sound instrument it might lend itself to becoming, and what it might offer  as an instrument to the unfolding of the event. On  the first day, percussion was the favored approach. The result was cacophony—and seriously percussed nerves all around.
