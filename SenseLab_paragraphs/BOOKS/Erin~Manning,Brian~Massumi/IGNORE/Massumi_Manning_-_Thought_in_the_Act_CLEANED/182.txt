Modally incommensurable, they only relate outside anything in common—most especially outside the logical common of anything that can be attributed a core  mental status.
There is no need to surreptitiously appeal to a common realm of implicitly  mental status in order to account for the thought-like aspect of movement. Movement “feels like potential” (Forsythe 2011, Nov. 17). Potential is abstract by nature, in the sense of not yet being this or that, here nor there. What is abstract feeling, if not thought? Movement-moving is thinkingfeeling: sensation integrally imbued with singular notional force. Potential  is not of the if–then. Potential is allied to what-if. The  thinking-feeling that is movement-moving is speculative: notional in the sense in which it can be used as a synonym for speculative.
