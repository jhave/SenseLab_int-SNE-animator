The  giving of giving is a ritual of emergent attunement that is a technique for reorienting the event of coming-together. It alters time. The now of giving is already reorienting in a future-fielding of the moment. Giving sets into motion an anticipation of the limit that futures the present in the making in such a way as to make felt and simultaneously ward off a necessary crossing of a thresholdâ€”in a kind of preemptive politics.
