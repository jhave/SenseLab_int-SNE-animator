The  SenseLab does not exist “as  such.” It is not an organization. It is not an institution. It is not a collective identity. It is an event-generating machine, a processual field of research-creation whose mission is to inside itself out. Its job is to generate outside prolongations of its activity that ripple into distant pools of potential. Ripple-effect: one idea becomes a seed for organization, which becomes a proposition for a concept, which becomes a problem for art,  for politics, for philosophy, that may, if the conditions are  ripe, resolve itself into the triggering of an event of collective experimentation and creative expression. This  event potential is (dis)embodied in the trickstered-trickster figure of the free  radical, gone spectral. When the conditions have been right and the event has  been generated, it has always come into itself in a relation with its radical outside—which it paradoxically generates flush with its own occurring, also immediately in relation to distant events beyond itself.
