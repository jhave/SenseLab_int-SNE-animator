To give just a few examples of a molecular intervention, the San Diego– Tijuana molecule addressed immigration issues around the U.S.–Mexican border. They hijacked a public telephone booth on the Mexican side  and converted it into a free  phone by  patching the connection into Skype. Mexicans who were  deported from the United States or encountered difficulty entering were  invited to use  the phone to notify friends and family or to call for help.34 The Amsterdam group addressed issues of ecology and food practices. They foraged for edibles growing in the city  and prepared a collective meal from what they found in the urban environment. One of the Montreal groups spent time observing the life of derelict spaces in the city  slated for redevelopment: who used them, how they used them, what patterns of movement grew  up around them, and how they were  policed. They joined in the patterns of movement and tried to organize participatory encounters that gave  a gift of conviviality to the ephemeral community they found. Among these was  a “Lack  of  Information Booth” that invited the public to explore the missing links between the official view of the city  and its  redevelopment and the ground-level forms of life filling  the pores in the urban fabric. The  Ottawa–Gatineau molecule performatively, and ironically, addressed feminist issues. They celebrated the vagina dentata.
