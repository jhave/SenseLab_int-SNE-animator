Note that in Mukhopadhyay’s recounting, the moment is the subject. The  subject of  the experience is not the human but the fielding of  the event itself. The  human element alone is not sufficient to account for the field’s  activity. Instead of a pre-composed subject standing over and above the event, overshadowing the moment, we have a vying commotion of co-activity. The  dynamic form of that co-activity coming toward expression is what Whitehead calls  the “subjective form” of the event. In Mukhopadhyay’s account, the moment’s subjective form is as yet  unresolved. It quivers still  in the disquiet of the intensely resonant field. The problem of the moment is how the commotion will  sort out: which register of field-effect will  stand out, having most forcefully expressed itself vis-à-vis the others. Only once this shakedown occurs will the determinate content of the event be defined as predominantly a reflecting or a conversing, a shadowing or a penning.
