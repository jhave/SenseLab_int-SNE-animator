There is no central leadership, even in the representative form of elected delegates to an executive group. Interaction moves between autonomously organized small-group initiatives and assemblies of all  participants without differentiation by  rank or  function. The  purpose of the assemblies varies depending on the organizational needs, but what they have in common is that they wield no coercive, disciplinary, or even regulatory power. Their aim is not to produce conformity to a common program. The aim is to coordinate a heterogeneity of energies, transforming them, in the back-and-forth between small-group interaction and whole-group interaction, into creative synergies. The  affinity-group structure works to enhance self-organization by conducting differences into a symphony of collectively attuned initiatives, rather than reducing differences by  funneling them into a common adherence to a directive set  of principles and strategies.
