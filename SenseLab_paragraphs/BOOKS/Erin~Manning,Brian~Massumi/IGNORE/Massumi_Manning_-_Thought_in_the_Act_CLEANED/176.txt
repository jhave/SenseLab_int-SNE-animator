With respect to all  of  the techniques, it helps, Forsythe says,  to go “extremely fast” (2003b, 20).  Because at extreme speed, the body “pushes the limit of  its coordination”  (Forsythe 2003b, 20). Its habits collapse into the velocity of movement. The  body is at the limit of its functional capacity to chain positions and postures meaningfully and adaptively. It has  no choice but to surrender itself to its own order of sensation. Movement approaches escape velocity, where it returns to its own orbit. Collapse of the sensorimotor schema.
