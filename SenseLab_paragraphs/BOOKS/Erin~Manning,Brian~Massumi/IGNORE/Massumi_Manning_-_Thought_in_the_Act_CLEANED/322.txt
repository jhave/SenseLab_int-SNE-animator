The  power of  the relational whole to rebegin constitutes a “spiritual space where what we choose is no longer distinguishable from the choice” (Deleuze 1986,  115). This  is not a physical space, a space that materially contains. It is a relationally reopening space, “identical to the power of the spirit” (Deleuze 1986,  117).
Through the exercise of  its  power to choose itself, the painting process  becomes a formative force of  thought. The  painting process is its own thinking-feeling subject, moving choosily across material operations, choosing steadfastly in the moving, while remaining fortuitously, openly, relationally irreducible to them. It  moves from painting to painting, machine to machine, through series, from form to trace, through phases of color, to come out into its own, in clouds of painting-thinking thickening  the transparency of the spiritual space of the open whole into a movement of white self-relating.
