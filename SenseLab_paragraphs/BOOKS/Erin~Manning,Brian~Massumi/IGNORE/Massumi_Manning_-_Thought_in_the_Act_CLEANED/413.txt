The  enabling constraint of  creative chaos is meant to disable these limitative constraints of  generic formatting. The  work of  the event will be to confront the question of how a research-creation event can come to distribute the sensible differently, starting from the most minimal formatting. If one participant comes with a philosophical discourse to present and another with a cacophonous interactive sound installation, how can these two activities cohabit the same event? What kind of economies of exchange and reciprocity can make this possible? The  activities brought to the event may well  embody existing genres, but the space-time parameters into which they enter together will  be  unformatted, and the value weightings and distribution of roles indeterminate. Exploding a gallery will depend on how interference can be transformed into resonance. How does an event create an emergent attunement? Can a collective event–caring symbiosis emerge? If so, how can the public be brought into the process at a certain phase of the event’s unfolding in a role other than that of audience or spectator: as an active, co-causal factor in the event? Given the chaotic conditions, the task  seems nothing if not impossible.
