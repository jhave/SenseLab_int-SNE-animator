The outside does not exist as such. It participates, it activates. It is always and only relational. Intensive interval contributive to an event in-forming, the outside captivates a process. It makes felt the virtual share of the actually  perceived. It is an ally,  a germ of unease, a friendly if troubling interloper that co-inhabits all tendings toward form, an essentially “unformed element of forces” (Deleuze 1988: 43).
The  outside invites thought to linger in the elasticity of  a  takingform: thought not as  already-constituted but as  a  force for  creative thinking-feeling.
