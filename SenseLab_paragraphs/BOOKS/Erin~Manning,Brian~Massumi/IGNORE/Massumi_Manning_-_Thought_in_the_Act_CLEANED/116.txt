“Landing sites abound within landing sites” (AG 2002, 9). The architectural surround is a crisscross field of many streams. A field of nested abundance. It does not begin with a form. It does not begin with a figure–background configuration. It begins as a populated field of alterant-altering interfusion. Agencies-patiencies abound for the apportioning. For anything in particular to happen, a particular expanse must be taken: “The taking of a particular expanse to be a landing site happens in a flash” (AG 2002, 9). Having been taken  to be, the landing site  now is. To be is to be had in a flash.
