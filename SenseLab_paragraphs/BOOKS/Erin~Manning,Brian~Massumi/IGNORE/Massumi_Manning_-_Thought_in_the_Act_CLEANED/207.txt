Virginia Woolf’s Mrs Dalloway also  plays with vision, tuning it toward the visionary. It  was  this aspect of  the text that most excited the Forsythe Company in the creation of Woolf Phrase (Forsythe 2003a). Working through the text, Forsythe speaks of having the insight that a technique could be invented to make dancing visionary. The dancers could technically become visionary. The  technique that he originally developed, and that was enhanced through the making of the piece, “had to do with identically remembering another person’s variation, or sprays, and building a kind of architecture of movement around it.” The caveat: “you had to keep seeing this other person dancing in order to perform it, so it was a way of having a vision” (Forsythe 2003a). A collective vision.
