“In  a truly successful dance,” Forsythe explains, the body “takes over at the point where you” have “no more idea” (2003a, 24).  Like the choreographer watching the dance unfold, you, the dancer, must dance with the unknowability of “what’s actually in front of my  eyes.” You  must dance the future in its  visionary unfolding. In  the motional intensity of  “not knowing,” operational, always, within the time-loop of the flow-match, it is the “body that dances you around” (Forsythe 2003a, 26): the thoughtbody. Thinking in movement. “The body thinking itself into the flow  of the world, and the world flowing into the thinking of the body” (Caspersen
2011,  100). The  dance does not have to embody movement ideas, does not have to think the idea in advance of its commotion. Motionally, the body is already speculatively tinged with mentality, in its own mode.15 In motion, the body is already notional, in its own order. “Corporeal-kinetic forms and relations are conceptual by their very nature” (Sheets-Johnstone 2009b, 221). There is no having ideas. You do not have ideas. The body itself, with its rhythmic milieu, is a motional-notion: a movement of thought. Dance that thought around.
