The interplay between transparency and white that traverses the entire process is the thinking that is painting. The color-phases that emerge across the movement of this thinking-itself of painting are what gives  it feeling, and reimparts it to perception. Colors: thickenings in the interplay of light, between transparency and white opacity, absorbing the vicissitudes of the thinking process, radiating the feeling of it,  registered in degrees of cold and warmth.
