Dynamically, the visual activation will  be  analogous in its  dynamic contours to the movement spray. They will  share the same activation contour â€”with a significant difference. Native to the visual system is the tendency to structure its field  not at any-point, but at a focal point. What in the gestural nexus was a multivectorial knot now homes into retinal focus. The  throwing of the curve becomes a stand-out, stand-alone, visually focused form. The  stand-alone form of  the movement belongs wholly to vision. But it can belong to vision only because it has  come to stand out in this way  from the shared activation contour that triggered its  appearance. In  this shared activation contour, movement and vision dynamically coincide. They are in a state of dynamic superposition across their difference from each other, each in its own manner, on its own register, according to its own order.
