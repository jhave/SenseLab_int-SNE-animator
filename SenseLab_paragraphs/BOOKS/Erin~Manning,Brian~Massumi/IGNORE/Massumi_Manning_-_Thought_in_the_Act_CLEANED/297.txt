Now turn to Ettinger’s No Title  Yet,  No. 1—St. John the Baptist and note that the friend is never represented, its tendencies never absorbed into a form or a figure. The  friend remains a force for thought. And  yet there are contiguities, if you approach the works in the register of thinking-feeling. Note the tremulous foregrounding-backgrounding in this image and especially how the white is never fully a presence or simply an absence, how it mists, how it moves, a shivering that comes forth, a shivering attuned, perhaps, to the force of the foregrounding of the background in Da Vinci’s painting, a force less  figural than intensive, less  form than mobility. The  intercessor: a vibratory intensity, felt-thought, that refuses to let  the work stand still.
