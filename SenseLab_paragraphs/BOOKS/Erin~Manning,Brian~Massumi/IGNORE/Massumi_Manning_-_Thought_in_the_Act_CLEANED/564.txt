1.   The project in the SATosphere was titled Into the Midst (October 15–22, 2012). Its aim was to problematize the relationship between the SAT and its urban surround, between the floor space of the SATosphere reserved for  the audience and the projection surface of the 15-meter-high dome, and between the participatory process and ways  of opening its intensities to a public. See http://senselab.ca/wp2/events/ into-the-midst/. For accounts of this event by participants, see also  Intelligent Agent, special issue on Into the Midst  (forthcoming).
