Movement always starts from a superposition, a mutual inclusion of sequential forms. The  form of the movement cannot be  reduced to the sequencing of positions and postures. Don’t strike the pose: “put the activation in every part” (Forsythe 2011, Nov. 10). Let your body subside into its movement pulsing, which will  then throw itself a curve. The  arc  may well surprise you. Forsythe: “No  movement is so possessed of its form that it cannot find another” (2011,  Nov. 10).  Ride  the wave of  movement’s occurrent variation.
