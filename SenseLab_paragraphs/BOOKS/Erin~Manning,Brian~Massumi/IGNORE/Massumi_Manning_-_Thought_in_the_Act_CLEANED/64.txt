In  retrospect, it will  likely appear to you that the predominant object singled out by  your memory—the sidewalk—had been your affordance from the subway to the office. In  the office, cluttered with entraining affordances—the computer for  e-mailing, the phone for  message checking, the chair for sitting—objects will  be in focus again. But in the mode of environmental awareness that effectively got  you to the office  on time, it was  not the object “sidewalk” that afforded the last  leg  of your commute. It was the fleeting openings, now forgotten. The  openings are long gone. The  sidewalk remains. The  stability of the sidewalk, its ability to refeature in experience from moment to moment, is an enabling condition for  the ephemerality of the openings. This  is how what we single out as objects figure for environmental awareness in the moment: as fused into a field of movement, their stability entering into that field on equal footing, as one contrast in its complex relational patterning.
