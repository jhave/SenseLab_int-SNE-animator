Forsythe asks: “Can ballet actually produce . . . something we don’t know? We’d  like to [. . .] investigate what it feels like to speak that way” (2003a). What-if? What-if this épaulement, this singular movement-formation, were turned in on itself, subverting the organization of the organs, of the limbs? What-if the gaze, normally turned askance toward the audience, were turned in, turned back into the head in visual “disfocus” (Forsythe 2000) so that “the body [. . .] becomes an ear, [. . .] an organ for listening” to the rhythmic milieu (Forsythe 2003a)? What-if this extension we call  an arabesque opened less onto a posture or a pose, a completed form, than onto the feeling of a passing balance?
