A platform for  relation is a setup, system, or  set  of procedures that is already tendentially operative, but rather than affording a specific function at first approach, is more suggestive of it. A platform for relation does work, it embodies a certain technicity, but it is designed in such a way that the limits and parameters of its potential functioning are not readily apparent. This  strategic incompleteness makes platforms for  relation function first and foremost as attractors offering openings for inventive interaction. Platforms for relation are not technical forms standing as end products of a design or creative process. They are germination beds for a process rebeginning. The platforms for relation were  envisioned to jump-start existing collaborations and generate new projects, to gather the eventâ€™s unrolling around the incipience of technicities to come. The invention of platforms for  relation was  the enabling constraint for  Housing  the Body, Dressing the Environment.
