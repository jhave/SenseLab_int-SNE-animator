Participants of course still had their disciplinary stature, position in their fields, and postural habits. This was not denied. The point was not to create a fictional equalizing, as if we could simply step outside of structure. There is no denying that we all need structure of some kind for our professional and personal survival. We  took to heart Deleuze and Guattari’s warnings about the dangers of too-sudden or  brutal “deterritorialization” and the need for  “sobriety” (which we  understood in terms of  the centrality of technique). The  point was not to force a heroic struggle against structure, which too often leads into a “black hole” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 161).  The  goal  was altogether more modest: to prime people’s capacity for creative play in a way  that directed them to the event’s own hospitality. This orientation in the event, we hoped, might give rise to reiterable movements of creative collaboration that would continue beyond this phase of the event process.
