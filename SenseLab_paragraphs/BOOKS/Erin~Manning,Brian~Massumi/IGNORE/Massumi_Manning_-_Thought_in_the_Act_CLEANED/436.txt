There is a well-worn term for the relational machinery that moves a field of emergence through its serial expressions, specifically in a way that feeds the outcomes of each self-registering event onto a surface of recording where their comparative value can be  assessed in some way.  It is economy. In  a formal economy, the valuation is quantitative and is derived using conventional measures. The formal valuation then feeds back into the field of emergence, to become an enabling constraint that conditions next expressions. Each expression generates an assessable yield, and the yields mutually reinforce (or weaken) each other. The mutual reinforcement or weakening across iterations can itself be quantified, in statistical indexes assessing the “health” of the process.
