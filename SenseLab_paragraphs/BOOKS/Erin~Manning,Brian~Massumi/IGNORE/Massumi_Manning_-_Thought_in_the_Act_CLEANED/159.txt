The  dancers are  instructed to “take the movement as far as it will  go” (Forsythe 2011, Nov. 10). But if you are attentive to where it is going, you feel it move in more than one direction. When the arm is stretching into a curve, the hip has already joined in throwing the curve. When the arm has finished moving, the hip is still  going. Its movement radiates down into a flourish of the leg.  A single movement comprises a differential “spray” (Forsythe 2003a) of  movement lines akimbo, now beginning now ending, in the moment differently together. The  “any-point” where a movement starts and stops is actually a spray, a splay, a spread: a point-field. It doesn’t start at any point.  Movement is not simply localizable in space.
