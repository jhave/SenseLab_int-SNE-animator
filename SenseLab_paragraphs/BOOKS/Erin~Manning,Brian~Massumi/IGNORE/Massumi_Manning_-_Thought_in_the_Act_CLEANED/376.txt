The  call  for  participation generated the first  set  of platforms, as each participant was  invited to propose one. Then the core  event-organizing group parsed the platforms into categories and reproposed them as collective platforms to the participants in a bid to limit the number of platforms to six. The platforms were then recomposed through affinity in the months previous to the event by  subgroups working independently through the SenseLab’s online grouphub. On the public setting of  a  “writeboard,” the platforms were  intricately planned, sometimes co-germinating across one another. All groups were  encouraged to begin to collectively plan how their platform could become a three-day workshop for the event. Within a few months, participants had settled into their platforms and altered them to suit their needs and desires. What the participants did not know yet was that we would ask  them to give  their platform away after the first  workshop, thus creating a contagion between processes. We fully expected some platforms to resist the violence of this decree and that some would fall apart for  lack  of participants. The  idea was  to create a process within a process that would allow unforeseen interventions and regroupings to unfold. For Housing  the Body,  the generative transitions would be between platforms as well  as between small-group and large-group activity.
