The  act  of painting, the paintingâ€™s act,  creates an imperceptible face,  a spectral opening, an outside that trembles from within, appearing in the disappearance of a process that for more than twenty years has  privileged this uncanny threshold.
Face as co-constitutive yawning abyss that activates and populates, that faces and defaces, that folds and expresses, making the outside felt,  face as that unfigure that never quite comes face-to-face, its facing a continuous appearance-disappearance across series.
