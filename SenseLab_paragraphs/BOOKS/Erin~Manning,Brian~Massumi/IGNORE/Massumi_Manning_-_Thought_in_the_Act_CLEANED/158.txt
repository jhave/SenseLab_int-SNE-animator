This  sounds like  a nonanswer of indifference: whatever . . . (to  phrase it like a teenager again). But when it is added that “any point within each piece contains the essence of the whole” (Caspersen 2011, 94),  it becomes apparent that far from being indifferent, any-point is a most singular point. In  movement alone, in its  own order, uncontrasted with language, any point is already overfull. The  overfullness of movement with itself, on its own plane, Forsythe says,  must be felt for movement to be made.
“Once you stretch one limb,” Forsythe remarks, “all kinds of other places stretch and retract” (Forsythe 2011, Nov. 10). Stretch it again in a different way, and the stretches and retractions shift. Every part of the body is a knot of different potential stretches and retractions radiating from that point as “so many vectors” (Forsythe 2011, Nov. 10). So many lines of movement, potentially passing through each point. Each  starting point of movement holds these potential passings through in itself, together in their difference from each other. The  move is less a point than a vectorial gestural nexus: a differential, dynamic knot of potential variations on itself. A milieu of movement potential synthetically including an infinity of disjunctions.
