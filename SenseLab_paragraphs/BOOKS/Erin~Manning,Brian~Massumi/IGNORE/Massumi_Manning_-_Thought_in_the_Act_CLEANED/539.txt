1.   It is still too common to separate so-called “low-functioning” autistics from high-functioning autistics. Like many on the spectrum, we reject this nomenclature. All autistics function differently, and this functioning has  effect on how they excel in a largely neurotypically inflected world. As others within the autism activist community have pointed out, the labels that have become commonplace in autism in many cases  only serve to reinforce the assumptions of the neurotypical (or ableist) community. See,  for  instance, Amanda Baggs’s  blog post titled “Aspie Supremacy Can Kill”:  “I know that to many aspie supremacists it doesn’t feel  like  that’s what they’re doing. It feels like they are just stating common sense, that aspies have more valuable skills, more logic, less dysfunction, whatever, than other autistics. But that’s because having a bit  of relative privilege renders them unaware of the full  consequences of their actions. They don’t realize that they have things backwards—the more devalued you are,  the more you need equality, the more you need to be considered another important part of human diversity, etc.  Not the less.  And  ‘less’ is what aspie supremacy ends up meaning to those of us  who (even when we  have some very  valued skills  in a few  areas) are  more vulnerable to devaluation and all of its effects. Including the lethal ones” (2010d).
