The  form of movement, in and of itself, is not a straight line. It is a pulse. It  is a waveform. Forsythe: “Waves on the seashore, one coming in as the last  is going out, overtaking, receding. Don’t be where you are. Make yourself tidal” (2011, Nov. 10). In the tidal interval, the waves cancel each other out for an uncountable beat. They collapse into each other in dynamic superposition. At this any-point of superposition, there is no visible movement. The body, movement, is in suspense. But the interval is no less motional for being in suspense: a welling; already a next overtaking a receding. A one, a two, the interval is co-motional. It doesn’t stand for anything. It doesn’t mean anything in particular—particularly not in general. It stands for what it is, which is what it does: a repotentializing interval of movement folding its  sequential forms into its  rolling on, the subsiding trace of the last  a-bodying with the next to come. Movement never stops. It suspends itself in its own furtherance.
