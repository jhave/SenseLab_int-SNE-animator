“I gave myself intercessors,” writes Pierre Perrault, “to be able to say what I have to say”  (in  Deleuze 1995,  125). Intercessors—forces of the outside— are made, created, given to a process. Ettinger’s studio is carefully crafted, to enter it is to enter a world: Monet, da Vinci, her own paintings on easels, on the wall, Lacanian publications, a book of philosophy open to a certain passage, the constant cup of iced coffee, Johann Sebastian Bach’s Matthaus Passion  or,  in other moods, Keren Ann, Shalom Hanoch, Radiohead. In the adjacent dining room, in the kitchen, certain guests (more friends) are invited to participate, to modulate the environment. “I need my  intercessors  to express myself, and they could never express themselves without me:  we  are  always many at work, even when it’s not obvious” (Deleuze 1995: 125). The intercessor is a complex singularity that activates a process, a force that acts as a differential within an ongoing movement of thought. The  intercessor: the felt  force that activates the threshold between thinking  and feeling.
