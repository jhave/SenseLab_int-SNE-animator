The  gift-giving ceremony was based on a well-known game.4 All of the wrapped gifts were  heaped in one location, unmarked as to the identity of the giver. As gifts “for the event,” they were  meant to offer  something that could potentially be activated as an affordance or platform for relation in view  of the interactions to come. This  would make each gift  an offer  of a relational angle of involvement in the event that the recipient might later activate. Participants were  invited to come up,  one by  one, and choose one gift.  The  catch was that when it was your turn, you could decide not to open a new gift,  but instead take a gift  that someone else  had already received and unwrapped. Should you take someone else’s  gift,  the gift’s original recipient would then be invited to choose a new gift.  Participants put a great deal of themselves into the gifts  they gave, knowing that they would be offered to the group anonymously. The  anonymity of the gifting  made the “personality” of the gift an occurrent character of the event, rather than an identifying marker of the source individual. The  opportunity to “steal” an already-given gift lent a ludic element to the ceremony, making the exchange itself more performative and loosening the connotation of the transfer of rightful possession that normally underwrites other practices of gift  giving. The  gift-giving ceremony set  in place a relational unwrapping across the threshold into the event that exceeded the giver– recipient duality. The gift was attached more to the collective potential that might be deployed over the coming days than to the giver or the receiver.
