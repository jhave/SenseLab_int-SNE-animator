To  a neurotypical, something qualitatively different tends to occur in the same field. Because going through a door is such a habitual experience, the crossing is likely to occur as if automatically, without the interplay of qualities, their relay, the emergence of door, and the opening of the affordance even registering. Doorness disappears. The  door figures as always-already passed through, habitually. Any  description of it will have to be  a reconstitution, the event coming toward expression in language from the field  of memory rather than from the field  of immediacy. This  is yet another variation, in addition to environmental awareness and cognition and their flicker: that of reflective consciousness. Reflective consciousness is a variation on the neurotypicalâ€”underlining the point made earlier that every mode of existence, including the neurotypical, is in fact  neurodiverse, intermodal in its internal composition.
