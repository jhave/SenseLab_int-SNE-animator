In physiology, a free radical is an unbonded oxygen molecule loose in the body. Free radicals are a natural by-product of the body’s life-sustaining metabolism. But due to their high reactivity, they may also  interfere with the body’s regulated functioning by destroying the bonds between molecules, releasing still  more free radicals. Free radicals possess a “bond dissociation energy”: a contagious power of destruction immanent to the very process that ensures organic functioning. The  role  of the free  radical for Generating the Impossible will  be to break down the emergent attunement after it has  just emerged, but before it can stabilize into a self-sustaining harmony that might assert itself as a model. The free radical is envisioned as a kind of trickster figure that will intervene at the penultimate stage of the event’s emergence, preempting too-unified an organ-ization. The free radical will infiltrate the event-space with a joyfully affirmative bond dissociation energy. As the contagion spreads, the event will return to the creative quasi-chaos from which it came, leaving only the ripples of its passing.
