As with all  SenseLab events, there was  a  daily movement between whole-group interaction and small groups. The  affinity-group structure was another exploratory technique for creating a transversality that would eclipse the tendency for “reporting”: as with other events, we were  interested less in moving content from one group to another than in creating fields  of affect that could flow between them. For Generating the Impossible, each day began with the larger group assembled together for work sessions organized around a preselected series  of philosophical readings. With the affinity groups in place, we hoped the work of the large-group events would trickle down into the rest  of the day’s  hands-on experimentation at the affinity-group level, synergizing creative thought and action into an integrated research-creation process.
