As-if,  Virginia Woolf writes, “as  if this beauty, this scent, this colour [. . .] were  a wave which she  let  flow  over her and surmount that hatred, that monster, surmount it all”;  “as if one will  worked legs and arms uniformly, and life,  with its  varieties, its  irreticences, had been laid  under a pavement of monuments and wreaths and drugged into a stiff yet staring corpse by discipline” (Woolf 1992,  14). Seventy-five times as if in Mrs Dalloway,  each time touching on the impossibility of the simple coupling of this and now. As-if, a rhythmic suspension that holds the presenting of the present to itself in itself, that denies this image its simplicity of unfolding, creating a knot in the discursivity of language. As-if: a mode that moves language to its  narrative limit, pushing language to say  not how if and then follow, but how “if”  becomes its  own limit, a transversal limit that cuts across the if–then.
When the Forsythe Company decided to work with Mrs Dalloway, the focus, once again, was not on retelling her story, but on “moving around the rhythm of  Woolf’s language”  (Sulcas 2001).  How to move into the text’s visionary force? How to fold movement into the as-if of Mrs Dalloway’s  speculative language? How to create techniques that were  capable not of responding to language, or illustrating language, but of moving in counterpoint with language? Dog-like, seagull-like, not in the realm of representation, but in the elemental realm of formative feeling-tone. “Richard and I worked to dehumanize our bodies by giving them elemental qualities  (like  the ocean) or animal qualities (like  a bird, a dog, or bees). Movement thus becomes entangled with sound or nature: circling and mewling, barking and jumping, the sound of waves surging” (Lang 2004, 128). Circling, jumping, surging: not forms but activation contours. As-if: in nonsensuous similarity.
