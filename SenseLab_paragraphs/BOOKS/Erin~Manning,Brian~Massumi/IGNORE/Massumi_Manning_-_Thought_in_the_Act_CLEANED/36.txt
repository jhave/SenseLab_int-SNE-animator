Thank you to all  the members of the SenseLab with whom we  have had the privilege of  experimenting in the collective organization of events exploring how art  and philosophy can co-compose. For  both of us, the SenseLabâ€™s varied activities have been a privileged incubator for the thinking-in-the-act this book is all about. Over the past ten years, we have been lucky to be able to gather around us and circulate among philosophers, artists, activists, and researchers who have been unfailingly enthusiastic in the process of developing new techniques for  the invention of modes of thought in an event-based ecology of experience. This  book is dedicated to you.
