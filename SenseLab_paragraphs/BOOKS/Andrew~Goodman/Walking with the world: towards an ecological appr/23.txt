In the space of the peak-hour train, where spatial relations shift quickly, this process becomes more consciously attended to, but, even in a familiar space, one might notice the processes by which the space-body-movement relation enfolds the body and object/world into shared individuations. Entering a train carriage we begin to create landing sites, depositing awareness and body-potential to varying degrees of clarity in the space. A change in height or texture underfoot as we enter creates a foot-floor site, a commuter’s MP3 player or a conversation sites attention vaguely in one direction, the line of bodies exiting the train deposits attention towards this flow. The vacant seat we see in front of us concentrates attention not only on the object itself and the seat-body kinesthetic potential (stopping, sitting down, a virtual becoming-with of seat/body that makes the seat also part body and body part seat), but also on the kinesthetic possibilities of surrounding floor space (the potential of moving to or beyond the seat)2. Attention is distributed on both the more physically concrete (arrangements of bodies and objects) and on a more vague, diffuse level such as the ephemeral (reflections of light on surfaces, affectual tonalities). Landing sites move through, over, around and inside other landing sites, each divisible into smaller sites, continually complicating relations as the body moves and redistributes itself in the environment. The point at which we are pressed against other bodies becomes a shared site of focused attention located within a general awareness of another passenger’s volume, for example. As we move through the space the sites make such navigation possible, and we begin to propose relational and kinesthetic possibilities. The landing site on the exit opposite not only creates a site of attention, but also wraps both body and door in potential future kinesthetic relation (an exit from the train).
