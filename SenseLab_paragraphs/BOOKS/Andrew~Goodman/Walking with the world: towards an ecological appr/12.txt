Movement, Manning argues, “allows us to approach (dialectical concepts) from another perspective: a shifting one” (Relationscapes 14-15). Walking invites an intimacy and active engagement with the singularities composing an experience that splits the homogenizing actions of the city. The streets we navigate or describe through remembered movements and sensations might perhaps disrupt any idea of an absolute organization of space with our shifting experience over time. Instead they become a “story, jerrybuilt out of elements” that is both “allusive and fragmentary” (De Certeau 102), layering and splitting the existing structure, filling the streets with forests of “desires and goals” (Ibid. xxi), and making the world habitable. An “in-between” is created that allows a movement, a flow of forces, bodies and affects.
