Nathaniel Stern’s ongoing Compressionism performances (2005–) comprise a customized scanner- battery pack-laptop assemblage worn or carried by one participant, while another holds and moves the scanner surface across objects and surfaces while the scanning is taking place to “perform images into existence” (Stern) through a kind of shared seeing-moving within an environment (see Figure 1). These scans are literally a “compression” of the temporal act into a two-dimensional image, operating as an affectual expression rather than representation of the act. Here I am going to restrict my discussion to a particular iteration of the work in Montreal in 2012 in which I participated, where the scans where performed collaboratively in the city streets as part of a larger art project3.
