As participants slowly moved the scanner over the surface of an object, intensities of felt contours and small deviations were translated into a larger movement of the hands and arms. The awareness of movement was also heightened by the fact that the object itself was always partially obscured from view by the scanner. Compressionism, in literalizing an exploration of disturbances to the ocular, created an imaging that was in the service of, and serviced by, a synesthetic coalescence of incidental sensations. It was a blind, groping approximation of the shape that was performed: a scramble of image memory, a drawing of the shape with the hands, a constant reforming of posture and balance, and an attention to the sound of the scannerâ€™s processes that resonated with the rhythms of bodies moving. Each object invited potential movements in relation to its form. For the minute or two before the laptop compressed the data into a viewable image (see figure 2), the event existed on its own as an awkward dancing of the object, an approximation of vision performed by a loose assemblage of other senses, drawn together by movement.
