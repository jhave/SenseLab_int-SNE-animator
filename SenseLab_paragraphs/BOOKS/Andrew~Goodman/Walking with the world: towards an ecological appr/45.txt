Compressionism accentuated a felt quality of “not knowing” – not knowing what was being captured, not knowing exactly what the scanner was pointing at, not knowing the start and end points exactly of the action, not knowing quite what constituted the body anymore or what delineated body/equipment/space. This was not a “lack” as such, but, as Stengers notes, a “characterization of a mode of working” (286) that foregrounded the multiplicitous nature of the point of actual/virtual at which we moved. Not knowing was here commissioned as a technique of production and a style of “tentativeness”, positioning bodies at the “edge of virtuality” (Manning, Relationscapes 35) that movement then stretched out.
