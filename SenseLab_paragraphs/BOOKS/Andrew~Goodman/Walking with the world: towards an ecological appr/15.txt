While walking can disrupt and reconfigure relations to space, it can also work to differentiate bodies through movement, allowing exploration of new potential intensive relations. Imagine that you are standing in a doorway, about to walk out. Except that the “stillness” undermines itself. You are already moving, Manning argues, in two important ways (Relationscapes 43-47). Firstly in that in a literal, physical sense the body is always in a state of intensive micro-movement, and secondly in the continuous gathering and incipient pull towards movement of the virtual. As you are about to begin, there are, Manning proposes, milieus of virtual possibilities that are composing themselves, creating tensions, an “elasticity” that is released as the possibilities resolve into an actual movement. The choices are not exactly infinite (in that not everything is physically possible), but are limitless in that they are being endlessly created, and each choice generates another equally complex series of choices. They resolve in the satisfaction of an actual event (your left foot takes a small step straight ahead), and all the virtual movements perish. This event “propels the preacceleration of a new occasion” (ibid. 38-9). That is, the new sets of virtualities begin composing possibilities for the next step or micro-movement. The limits of body, habits, responses to the space, and so on, all help to shape these potential movements, and it is walking here that both generates and selects from the potential actions.
