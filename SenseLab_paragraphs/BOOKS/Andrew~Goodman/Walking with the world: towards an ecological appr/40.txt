Compressionism might be seen to address a heightened awareness of, and engagement with the processes of the virtual in two ways. Firstly, in that it literally created new potential that the assemblage’s heterogeneous component parts did not hold on their own – such as new capacities for seeing, new postural explorations, and new prehensive potential to trigger actualizations. Secondly, in that it promoted, through continued disruption of any settling into habit, a kind of suspension in its own continued unfolding that made the ongoing individuations perceptually felt.
