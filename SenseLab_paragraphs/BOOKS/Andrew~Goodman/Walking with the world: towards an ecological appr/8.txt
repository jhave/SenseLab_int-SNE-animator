These concepts are then applied to Nathaniel Stern’s Compressionism performative work, to explore its potential to contribute a technique that enables exploration of some of the minor potential of walking the city. The particular configuration of technical objects and bodies in Compressionism is interesting, I argue, precisely because they not only contribute to a reactivation of the streets as De Certeau proposes, but because they begin to allow a reconfiguration of intensive bodily relations through the activation of new internal and external sites of attention. In considering this artwork, I do not mean to imply that the technological components of the work that help to transport the body beyond habit are an “augmented awareness” that might then be viewed as the postmodern counterpart to some romantic or mythical past of ‘pure’ or non-stratified relation to place. Rather, it is that the work problematizes the act of walking and engaging with the environment, and thus demands that the participant’s body itself seeks out new intensive and extensive minor relational potential. Thus it is a procedure to “escape or ‘reenter’ habitual patterns of action”, as Arakawa and Gins advocate, in order to reinvigorate our attention to these processes of contraction, and/or to explore alternative routes, and reinvent both processes and outcomes (62): precisely a minor practice.
