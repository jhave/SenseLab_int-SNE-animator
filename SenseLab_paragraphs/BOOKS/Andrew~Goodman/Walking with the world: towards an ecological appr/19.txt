In reality, walking the space of the city is never without constraints that propose and condition movement and a body’s projection and diffusion into space. Environments provide conditions – platforms of potential actions – that affect the actions of the walker. A park bench, for example, creates anticipation of a certain habitual action (sitting), and in this way works to order the movement in the space (Massumi, Urban appointment 4). These conditions can enable as much as they constrain, proposing new actions. Propositions, as “lures towards feelings” (Whitehead, Process and reality 259), construct potential from which events can draw, providing a virtual field from which the actualized differentiates. For example, a patch of grass might invite many responses from the walker: a place to lie down on, the danger of snakes in summer, wetness to be avoided after rain, the smell of the countryside and so on. These propositions potentially operate on multiple levels – sensorial (softness underfoot/wetness/smells), affectual (inviting tiredness and an urge to rest, fear of hidden danger, joy of a free space to play), and kinesthetic (sitting, lying, running, walking). The conditions of the space do not necessarily impose a habitual bodily response; rather, they can suggest, nudge, coax, lure or afford a range of potential actions into being. Such spatial propositions invite individual responses – actualities - triggered by common constraints, but which are nevertheless always at least on some levels singular.
