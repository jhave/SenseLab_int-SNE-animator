The assembling of body and scanner equipment provided new levels of potential intensive sensory difference. For example, the rhythms of the scanner head moving that the body attempted to follow but never quite duplicated; or the new decentering weight pulling on bodies that had to be resisted or followed, and new restrictions on the range of movements of the limbs; all these factors created tensions and difficulties. Again, the technological components were not, I would argue, specifically the producers of these new relations, but were a particular technique to activate the conditions under which bodies began to explore “sideways and decentered movements” (Deleuze and Guattari, Kafka 50). It was perhaps a system “advanc[ing] through problems and not through victories, through failures and rectifications rather than by surpassing” (Serres Conversations 188); a system charged with new indeterminacy. It required a new attention that drew the creative processes of worlding and bodying, which are always occurring, to a perceptible level. That is, they were felt in-process as much as in reflection – through the increased intensity they demanded and produced.
