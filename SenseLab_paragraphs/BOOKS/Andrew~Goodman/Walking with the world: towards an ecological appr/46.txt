In walking, as both De Certeau and Manning argue, a body already exercises potential to produce minor iterations of streets, bodies and their relations. As Deleuze and Guattari are at pains to emphasize, the minor is not a place of refuge (Kafka 40), but an activation that involves becoming a ‘sort of stranger’ (ibid 26) within a known system. Perhaps then the key to this artwork’s capacity to activate minor potential lies in its problematization of any mastery of conditions or movement, making the performers strangers within their own walking capacities.
