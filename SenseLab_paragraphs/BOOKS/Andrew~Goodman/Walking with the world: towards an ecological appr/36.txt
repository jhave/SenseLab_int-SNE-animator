Compressionism created a new sense machine, made new relations between senses through movement, and approximated a new eye-organ out of hands/feet/balance5. Vision no longer resided in the eyes or in the operations of the body-scanner production. Rather, through movement it was situated (as Serres proposes it might be), “along the tendons and the muscles” (Variations on the body unpaginated). What would normally be felt as a movement of the eyes over an object (still a movement on a smaller scale – the eyes traversing) was explicitly performed (danced) and brought to the fore through a shift in registers – from eye to full body movement that inscribed in space the emerging relation. The body-scanner assemblage performed sight in space, and the image was burned into a new retina: the scanner-laptop machine. This was a minor tactic in that it consisted of “adding to” and “perverting” habitual configurations of sense-organs (Deleuze and Guattari, Kafka 10) to increase the intensity of felt experience.
