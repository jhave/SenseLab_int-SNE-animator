This essay considers the potential of walking as a “minor” practice – a tactic with which to pervert or trouble the structure of an oppressive system (Deleuze and Guattari, Kafka 10) in order to explore ways to allow the oppressed qualities of the major to oppose its oppressive qualities (ibid. 27). In doing this I draw firstly on Michel De Certeau’s discussion on the ways in which walking techniques might be utilized to trouble the stratification of the city through a reactivation of relations between bodies and their environment. De Certeau calls this a “soft resistance” that seeks a creative flight from what he conceives as the structuring homogeneity of the city. As Highmore articulates, walking is “minor” in that it is positioned, less as direct opposition to structure, and more as that which “hinders and dissipates the energy flows of domination” (152).
