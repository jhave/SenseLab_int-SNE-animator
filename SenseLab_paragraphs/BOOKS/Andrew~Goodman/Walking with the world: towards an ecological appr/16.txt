Movement here could be seen as cutting across the body (ibid. 46), connecting and disrupting the actualized body’s relation to its larger potential, which is always also reconstituted by the activity. It is a technique by which a body accomplishes the shifting beyond itself of ongoing individuation. This evolving potential for new relations is precisely that which Deleuze and Guattari identify as a minor “flight” from stasis, a flight that is not an escape from oneself, but an increase in intensity or richness of potential (Kafka 13).
