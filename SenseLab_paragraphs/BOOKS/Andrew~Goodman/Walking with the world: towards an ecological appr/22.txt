Processes of landing sites then productively disrupt the limits of the body, constructing through dispersion a new extended and enriched potential bodying. These projected landing sites fold, nest, diffuse and focus dynamically while the body moves. It is a constant creative noisy process splitting stable relations. Landing sites work to enrich experience with a potential further fielding of body in the world, which ensures a “more than” of the kinesthetic body that is always dispersing and always reorganizing.
