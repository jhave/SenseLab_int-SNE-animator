The awkward shifts out of habitual postural schema that the performance demanded were fundamental to the immanent rearranging of the body that was produced. Posture, as Lingis notes, is negotiated between two poles: internal organization and tasks being performed. In performing Compressionism, the demands of the task encouraged a shift towards temporal organization that disrupted and differentiated from any habitual structuring (Sensation 55). The additional postural and gravitational burden of both carrying, balancing and concentrating on the scanning equipment brought these habitual postural relations and the disruptions to them to a consciousness that gave a heightened awareness. A sense of doubling of experience was evoked, feeding back into its unfolding with the presence of both a felt postural shift and a reflexive feeling of the feeling, working to moderate movements again.
