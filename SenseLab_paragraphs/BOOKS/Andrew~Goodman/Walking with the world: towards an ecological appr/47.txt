In this light, Compressionism might be seen as neither an attempt to return to pre-stratified states, nor as some new prosthetic melding of bodies and technologies to take us beyond the limits of the biological, but as a technique for bodies to disorganize their own forms in order to experiment with new expressions of relations (ibid. 28). If the “minor” is concerned not with outcomes, but with enabling the conditions for new connections to arise (ibid. 18), then perhaps the role that the technological component of the work plays is less about creating new relations itself, but with disrupting habit, turning the body’s attention to the capacity of walking to gather bodies into emergent and dynamic new ecologies.
