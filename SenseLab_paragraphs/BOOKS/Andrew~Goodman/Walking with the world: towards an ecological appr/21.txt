Arakawa and Gins describe the in-process of “portioning out” (5) of the space to deposit sited awareness around the body in such situations as “landing sites” (7). The body, they state, takes cues from the environment to “assign volume and a host of other particulars to the world” (7). These sites are a way that the body contributes to and distributes itself into the world: a “holding of the world” in attention (81). They are a process by which differentiation of the field occurs, to different degrees of specification and diffusion. This, Arakawa and Gins argue, is less a partitioning of the world, and more a process by which, perceptually and kinesthetically, the world and a body are immanently enfolded. In this sense, the body not only differentiates the space through movement, but also distributes itself within the space, contributing its awareness towards things in the world (81).
