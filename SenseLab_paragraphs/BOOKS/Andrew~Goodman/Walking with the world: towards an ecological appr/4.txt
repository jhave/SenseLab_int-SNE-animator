Every walk I set out on, even the most mundane and functional, is inherently an adventure into the unknown, into improvisation and discovery. If I am too jaded or numb to notice then I have only to invite a dog or small child to accompany me to realize or invent creative and connective possibilities. With dog or child in tow or towing me, my walk can never be simply a blinkered move from “A” to “B”. Instead it splits to become multiple, consisting of many foci, intensities, and heterogeneous singularities (Manning, Relationscapes 7). A particular smell, a pretty tree, a siren, a cat spotted, a game instantly evoked out of the walk: all layers of an experience that is being continually reinvented in response to stimuli. My body responds to the rock underfoot, cold wind, the effort of a hill, the anticipation of a busy road ahead, the pull of the dog’s leash. As Erin Manning says, in moving the body and the space vibrate with potential relationships and affects (Relationscapes 13). Such a walk is capable of being expansive without necessarily getting lost, or as a losing of myself, becoming a spatial practice that “slips into the clear text of the planned and readable city” (De Certeau 93). Eventually I arrive at “B”, but it has on some level become a different I, a different city to when I set out.
