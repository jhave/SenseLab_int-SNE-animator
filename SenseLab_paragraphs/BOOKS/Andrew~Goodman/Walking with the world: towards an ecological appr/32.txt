In its intensive searching out of the incidental and the singular, the body-scanner ignored the established networks of movement (paths, roads, doors). Bodies improvised new literal connective passages that opened gaps in between such systems of place, moving up walls, through holes, over horizontal, vertical and angled surfaces, backtracking to points of interest, inventing new affectual connections. This was a space experienced “not [as] a framework, an order or an arrangement, but [as] a nexus of levels…[found] not by moving toward them but by moving with them” (Lingis, Sensation 33). The space scanned was understood not through a stable image or representation, but as a dynamic expression of the relationships between moving bodies and environment – a “vital space” mapped through experience (Lingis, The imperative 145).
