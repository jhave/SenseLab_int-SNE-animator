The Compressionism event deposited a series of (mobile) landing sites – both those defined and more consciously prehended, and those diffused around the body/space event and in addition to those that walking the space might normally require. Part of the direct bodily attention landed in the held scanner as the mechanics of holding and operating the scanner forced new improvisation of relations and landing sites within the body. This was perhaps perceived in the attention becoming centered in the muscles of the hands and arms, in the feet maintaining balance (depositing more defined sites of attentiveness onto the surface, gradient and texture of the ground), and in the new and mobile collaborations of sensory input informing the movements that caused unexpected intensified conjunctions and  cooperation of surfaces beyond their usual functioning. Less qualified sites were also deposited in the vague attention of those carrying the rest of the equipment, with whom movements were coordinated, and to the space around the object or surface being scanned. A more general field of unfocused attention fuzzily composed itself around the wider space of the activity that bodies negotiated while focusing on the object being scanned. The more defined and useful landing sites were in the mobile spaces in-between object and scanner surfaces, while the unseen object itself remained a more generalized “imaging” landing site, in Arakawa and Gins’ terms, nesting within the particular while resisting definition. In this splitting and siting of attention that occurred Compressionism perhaps created what Deleuze and Guattari term “molecular agitations” (Kafka 50) that “escaped” the known capacities of bodies in the space through the multiplying of attention and of local connections (ibid. 37).
