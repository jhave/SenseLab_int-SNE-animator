This essay considers the potential in an artwork for walking to “world” the body. That is, how movement engages the body in processes by which a relational ecology begins to evolve. I begin with a concept of walking as a ‘minor practice’ that seeks a creative flight from the structured places of the city and from a body’s own capacity to succumb to habit and a loss of breadth of expression. Erin Manning’s writing on the moving body and Arakawa and Gins’ theories on body-space entanglement are briefly explored, and these concepts are then applied to Nathaniel Stern’s Compressionism, a performative work that actively applies the differential potential of movement to explore the ecological engagement of such activities.
