Compressionism involved a close investigative walking of the inner city landscape – through back alleys, park space, along surfaces of objects, architecture and bodies. It was an exploration of texture, colour and contrast held together by the collective movement of the bodies-scanner machine. The intensive, explorative, close-visioning movement in the city enacted through the Compressionist event was remembered through the personal, composed from actions, disjunctions and sensations. The colour of a particular leaf, the textural shifts on a building surface, the passage from tree to wall to doorway, the incidental sounds heard while waiting for the scanner to warm up, the effort of a particular stretching of the body coloured one’s memory of the event. It was a fragmentary mapping of a space – a haptic or closely focused narration carving intimate, personal actions onto the surface of the city space4. The haptic here showed its potential in bringing attention not just to the surface of the object, but also, in its engagement with multiple sensations, to participants’ own interior/exterior boundaries (Marks, cited in Jones, 143). This was perhaps most intensely experienced here in the slow traversing of the surface of an object being imaged by the scanner/hands as attention was focused both on sensations in extremities of the body and on the carefully composed space between scanner and object that needed to be retained.
