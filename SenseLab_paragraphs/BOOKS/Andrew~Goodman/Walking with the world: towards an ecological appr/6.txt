Stratified forces exist not only within the city, but also within bodies that are constrained by subjection. As Giles Deleuze and Felix Guattari term it, this is a body’s own capacity for “micro-fascism” (Thousand Plateaus 215) – its ability to succumb to stasis and a loss of connectivity and breadth of expression. I draw, secondly, on Manning’s discussion of the ways in which movement might allow a becoming-minor of a body. Walking, she argues, is a temporal, re-combinatory operation of becoming that decenters subjectivity and troubles stasis (Relationscapes 23); and thus a moving body, “is always more than one”, more than a fixed identity (Ibid. 63-4).
