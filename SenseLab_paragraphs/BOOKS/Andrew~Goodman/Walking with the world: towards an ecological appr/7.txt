Thirdly, Arakawa and Gins conception of the “landing sites” or nodes of attention that the moving body produces is introduced into the argument to further explore minor procedures by which bodies and the environment fold into one another and disturb boundaries. The intermeshing of body-world potential that Arakawa and Gins articulate is always in-process – thus emphasizing that the minor is never a stable position outside the major, but rather a performative exploration within an established system, be it a body or a city. Through these concepts I argue that walking is intrinsically inventive and relational: to space, to the body itself, to the potential that it both creates and differentiates from; and that it moves us beyond a stable configuration of relations between a subject and objects, and towards a more complex experience that begins to escape such boundaries.
