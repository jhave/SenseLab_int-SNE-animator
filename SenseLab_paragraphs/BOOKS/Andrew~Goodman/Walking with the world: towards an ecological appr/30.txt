Performing Compressionism was a somewhat awkward act. The size and weight of the scanner required that it be held in both hands away from the body, with feet braced to maintain balance. This created a tension running through the body stretching toward objects to be scanned. Keeping the scanner steady required a certain clumsy cooperation between both scanner and bodyweight as counter-balance, and also between the holder of the scanner and the person carrying the battery pack and laptop capturing the image. There was perhaps a zone of intimacy established, both between the collaborating bodies and between the scanner-body assemblage and the objects being scanned. Here scanner, body and space conjoined through the act of moving.
