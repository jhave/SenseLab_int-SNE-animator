Certain activities and spaces more forcefully disrupt habits by requiring an active and attentive care that brings to the fore the processes of connection and projection into the world. The urgency of movement and the complex negotiations required to enter or exit a peak-hour train, for example, brings to our consciousness the continual negotiations and collective reconfiguring of space required by moving in the city – calculating who will allow passage, who must edged around, intuiting minute adjustments of tempo and posture to keep a free space ahead. Positional information comes at the body from all directions as we compose a provisional line through the chaos, and premeditated, planned paths quickly become redundant in this situation. With every step, the space available –the virtual possibilities for the next move – shift and both the body and the path must be renegotiated. It is in such moments that require intensely improvised movement that the space might begin to approach a contingent, immanent quality that Manning describes (Relationscapes, 13-15, 29-34). Here, an encounter with the city is certainly not the free and idle wandering of the flaneur; rather, it is a series of conversations between competing forces and potentials affecting both the configuration of the space and the composition of the body (Ibid 15). This active making of walking-body-space is the moment in which movement can most productively produce a force of becoming that outstrips the molar (the stratified and centralized system) and the forces of cohesion (Grosz 92), and shift the body beyond identity through disruption to preconceived habits and structures.
