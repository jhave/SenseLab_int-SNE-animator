I want to question what the performance of Compressionism adds to the already dynamic becomings of the moving body in space. Or, rather, how it reinvents and draws out these processes, doubling them with new levels of perception and consciousness. Compressionism, I want to argue, alters not being itself, but the manner of being (Guattari, Chaosmosis 109): it creatively performs the body (and the space) in a new way, not to return it to an imagined pre-stratified form, nor to replace previous space-body modulations, but enfolded with existing relations. The work here challenges habits, provoking participants to intuit new minor ways of being on a practical, perceptual and conceptual level.
