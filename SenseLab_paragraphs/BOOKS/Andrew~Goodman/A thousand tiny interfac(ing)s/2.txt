Abstract: This paper examines the process of interfacing between organic and technical objects and how this might be utilized as a tactic to promote invention within new media art events. Raphael Lozano-Hemmerâ€™s Relational Architecture is examined in relation to concepts of parasitic action and folding to show how the work develops a complex ecology of relation through interfacing.
 Keywords: Interface, parasite, folds, concretization, ecology, autopoiesis, relation.
