3. Re:Positioning Fear 
Re:Positioning Fear consisted of an orchestrated shadow dance composed of a projected conversation thrown onto the architecture of the city that was made visible within participants’ shadows that were also cast on the surface, creating silhouettes of differing sizes depending on their distance from the light sources.
As Andreas Brockman writes [26], the work initiated a dynamic ‘social inter-facing’, constructing a ‘fragmented and heterogeneous system of engaging different publics in a variety of specific ways’ [27]. Here Lozano-Hemmer, as he often has, employed the bodies of the participants as disruptive ‘performed’ interfacings [28] within a machine composed otherwise of technical objects. This melding of technical objects with the unpredictable input of a public presents one possibility of providing the technical elements with an expanded potentiality, with the interfacing body play the role of ‘transducer between machines’ [29]. Here the connection between biological and technical objects was a tactic to generate difference, not collapse it, to produce ruptures or gaps in the process of ‘dephasing’, (in which a stable identity is delineated from ongoing processes of becoming).
