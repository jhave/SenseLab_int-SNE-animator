2.2 Transduction
It is perhaps common to think of interfaces as translators of code, points of information exchange, from digital to analogue or visa versa, or as a ‘point of contact where humans and machines meet in order for exchange to take place’ [21]. However to assert the primacy of the flow of forces rather than the secondary exchanges of text, transduction, I would argue, is a better way to fully think the event of interfacing. That is, as this paper will discuss below, transduction positions interfacing as the integration, through the flow of forces of differing viscosities, of formerly disparate things within a becoming-concrete system [22]. 
An art-event might be such a machine: regulating and producing affectual flows, a ‘machinic of expression rather than a signifying apparatus’ [23], a producer of movement or difference [24]. This, I want to demonstrate, positions interfacing as a prime creative force-form, for, as Deleuze states, ‘difference, potential difference and difference in intensity [is] the reason behind qualitative diversity’ [25]. Seeing interfacing as a machinic action implies a shift in designing art events to emphasis their machinic potential: their productive capacity or capability to produce difference, rather than for their aesthetic qualities. It is this operation of the interface as a differential machine that the rest of this paper addresses through an unpacking of Re:Positioning Fear: Relational Architecture 3.
