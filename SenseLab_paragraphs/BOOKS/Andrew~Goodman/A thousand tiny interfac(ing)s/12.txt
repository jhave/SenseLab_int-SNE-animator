4. Conclusion
The shifts that occur in Re:Positioning Fear as a result of interfacing were both materially (ontologically) slight and processually (ontogenetically) significant. What the participants brought to the event that instigated such a shift was in a sense no more than a new intention, or perhaps even less distinctively, a new tonality that infected the work to produce something new. This is not to suggest necessarily that what it shifted to was in itself significant, but that the way that interfacings performed such a shift was of philosophical and artistic interest, in that it provides a potential tactic towards the thinking of more autopoietic, and therefore open-ended systems of interactivity, suggesting a potential machinic, ‘minor’ art event, concerned less with signification than a collective becoming [51].
This interfac(ing) was performed, not, one can say, ever entirely by either the biological nor the technical systems making up the machine, but by the machinic action producing also the potential ruptures and the uncertainty of an evolving dynamic virtual that was its fertility. Here the further potential of interfacing remained present even as it was enacted. It perhaps remained as a ‘lure’ towards feeling, as a pull towards the future [52], a pre-relational tendency towards affectual relation.
Interfacing here was propositional of differentiation, attuning the conditions for potential trans-force-form events; luring multiple transductive events into being. The event, one might say, answered Stern’s call for interactive art to move away from privileging signs and images at the interface and the demonstration or fetishization of the technology in the work. Instead it engaged, as Stern proposes, ‘with the quality and styles of movement’ that were performed [53], with the invention of (new) styles, with the implicit, the potential, to construct new ways of relating through interfacing.
