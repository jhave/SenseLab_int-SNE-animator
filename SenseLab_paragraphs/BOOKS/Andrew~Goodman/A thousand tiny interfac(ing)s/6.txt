2.1 Differential machines
In this paper, I am going to use the terms ‘body’ and technical object’ in specific ways. Following Katherine Hayle, the ‘body’ referred to here is in no way limited to the subject or to a fixed or post-individuated stable entity, but can be taken to be always in-process, corporeal and enactive rather than ‘the body’ in any coded sense [11]. This is in sympathy with Deleuze and Guattari’s notion of a body as ‘a discontinuous, non-totalized series of processes, organs, flows, energies, corporeal substances and incorporeal events, intensities and durations’ [12]. Similarly the term ‘technical object’ as used here implies not a fixed object in the material sense, but is used to address a technical or non-biological entity that is itself capable of becoming, leaving the term ‘machine’ open for another use. 
Machines, as Guattari tells us, are any system that produces an effect; they function immanently and pragmatically [13]. Massumi, in expanding on this notion, explains that they are  ‘not subordinate to utility or laws of resemblance’ [14]. Guattari’s concept gives us three potentially useful ideas that help to expand the concept of the machine, in a decidedly non-humanist direction. Firstly, the need for an understanding of the role that the wider ecology in which technical objects are embedded (or with which they unfold) has in determining what potential is actualized. Machines here are ’proximity grouping[s]… [of] man-tool-animal’ [15]. Secondly, an understanding Guattari perhaps shares with Simondon that machines inherently contain potential beyond their immediate actualization, ‘ontogenetic elements’ [16]. That is, they are held together not so much by any physical bond, but by a shared virtual milieu, as an ‘assemblage of possible fields’ [17] that develops through the process of concretization. Thirdly, that we must consider machines not through utility or representation, that is, as not being ‘limited to [their] materiality or functionality’ [18], but in terms of their productive capabilities. Guattari’s conception of the machinic here shifts the assemblage from ‘what is it composed from/what is it an aggregate of?’ to ‘what does it produce?’                    
Such machines, as Munster states, operate to produce and regulate flows between the poles of movement and organization, between the qualitative or diagrammatic and concretization [19]. Thus perhaps one might propose that they are producers of the transduction of force: of a process by which such ‘an activity sets itself in motion’ at the same time as it generates ‘processes of modification’ [20].
