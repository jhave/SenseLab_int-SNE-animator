2. Interfacing
I propose to begin by thinking temporally rather than spatially, by thinking of these interfaces as moments rather than points of action or relation. This suggests that the interface might now be thought of more as a process of interfacing, as an unfolding or contingent process within a larger nexus of relation, asn in-action moment of intensity of disruption, contrast and invention rather than a privileged or static position within an art event.
Here I will briefly consider the idea of an art event as a machine producing transductions of forces, before attempting to unpack the creative role of interfacings in Re:Positioning Fear by suggesting that interfacing might productively parasite, fold or concretize; three different, though sympathetic, concepts concerned with intensive organization and creativity.
