Is this a ‘lively world’?  Not in the sense of a separate environment with which to engage, but perhaps in the sense that it is an enactive worlding containing body-ings: individuations occurring from the middle, always in the middle of other enactive process. The agencies that drive this, I am proposing, are best understood as the flow of forces, their transduction as they pass through and trigger the individuation of entities, integrating such individuations into an the ecology of a concrete system as it also drives invention.
