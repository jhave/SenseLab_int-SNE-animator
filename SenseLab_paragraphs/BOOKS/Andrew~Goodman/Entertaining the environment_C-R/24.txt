The power of the multiplicity here is that it takes us beyond the stalemate of the dichotomous, denouncing ‘simultaneously the One and the many, the limitation of the One by the many and the opposition of the many to the One’.

Hence Manning’s proposition: unlink the processes of entertainment and entrainment (however briefly or incompletely) in order to submerge oneself in the flow of individuation, of the gathering and transduction of forces from the field, the ‘no-time of the decision in the present passing’
