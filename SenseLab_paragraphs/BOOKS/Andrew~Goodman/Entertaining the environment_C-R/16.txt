All things, Whitehead states, are capable of feelings, prehension - resonances with other entities34, sensitivities to their environment: wasp and orchid, pen and hand, scissors and paper. Assemblages are more than binary machines. More than the multiple, they are multiplicities with their own logic – concrete not abstract, existing in their entirety or not at all: the chicken is not the chicken without the egg, it is ‘one and the same becoming’ . Multiplicity lies in the gaps (cracks) between molar opposites: between hand/scissors, body/paper, subject/artwork – in the transduction, the movement of forces through simultaneous individuations that pulls apart the molar, makes sieves of its boundaries.
