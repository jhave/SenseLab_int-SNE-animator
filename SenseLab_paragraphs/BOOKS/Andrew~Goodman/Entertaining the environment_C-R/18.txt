In Caminhando hand/scissors/ears form an assemblage based on shared rhythm of vibrations of the cutting of paper, hand/scissors/paper form alliances around the felt pressure of the cut, eyes/skin/paper form another assemblage around kinesthetic sensations. Affects pass through, initiate assemblages - new forms - instigating new forces, the assemblage is always in process, both gathering and dissipating. The arrangement of fibers in the paper form tendencies – to tear in this direction, resist in this way – that shapes the displacement of the force of the scissors. What do the scissors, the fingers, and the paper feel, what sensitivities form their worlds? How does their combined individuation, their shared assembling create and shape their potential? Each component in the assemblage both retains its own potentiality and is engaged in a dynamic exchange of force to unfold the larger, shared potentiality of the combined machine they become. In the event they become through the action of cutting, defined by their assembling(s), their shared sensitivities to the becoming-form of each other. That is, it is the forces instigating the unfolding individuation flowing through the entities – the event of cutting and their intertwined affectual relations (their ability to feel) – that forms the assemblage, distributes the agency, not within objects per se, but in the event itself.
