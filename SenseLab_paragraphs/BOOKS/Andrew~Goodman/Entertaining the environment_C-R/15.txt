Perform this work. No matter how much you know of it, how many times you enact it, it will still managed to turn you inside out. At the point where you have cut an entire loop of paper and are back to the beginning, instead of the scissors being next to the original incision, they are somehow on the other side. Sight contradicts expectation, hand/scissors contradicts paper – a gap opens up in the habitual perceptual schema, cohesion falls apart. The understanding of causal efficacy that the skin/hand sense datum leads one to expect fails to match the presentational immediacy, the link between the perceptual processes is made felt through their failure to smoothly orchestrate. Any stable sense of fixed space dissolves, briefly becoming purely relative to the movement – a sudden plunge into darkness.
