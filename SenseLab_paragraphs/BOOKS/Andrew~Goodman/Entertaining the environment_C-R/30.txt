That is not to say that the everyday does not contain such moments – those subtle but strange occurrences where the body schema becomes momentarily confused - causal efficacy and presentational immediacy fail to align - and the body scrambles to reassemble itself, allowing a brief glimpse into the processes of exchange and emergence in individuations. But it is perhaps in Caminhando’s ability, despite the banality of the actions, to detach the event from the habitual inattention to transduction, to create in Massumi’s words a ‘semblance’ that such processes are drawn to the fore. Semblance, as Massumi uses the term, is ‘the manner in which the virtual actually appears’, that is, its felt ingression into the event, its felt presence allowing a diagramming to take place, a thinking-feeling of the ‘dynamic form’ of relation and its connection to ongoing potentiality.
