Drops of water & the ocean, waves and the roar of the sea, droplets and clouds –multiplicities that yet consist of singularities (anything but dualities). This is the assemblage (which is also always the assembl-ing), trans-singular, more than its component parts, where cause & affect are lost in concrete inter-determined, co-causal birthing. You cannot have the individual without environment, the two are points on a path of symbiotic enaction, individuation driven by transduction that is the becoming of the whole system, both the actual and the virtual with which it resonates. Assemblages in Caminhando create  ‘concrete’ systems, in Simondon’s terms – a shared ecology in the largest sense (a shared milieu or potential alongside a connected actuality), a system with ‘internal coherence’, because the enaction of the assemblage is co-causal with its field of potential: field and individual are a multiplicity.
