The ‘environment’ here is not some backdrop to a theatre of operations, but the field of forces passing through entities – the force of the event that is processed through the hand/scissors/paper/eyes/ears/skin. Perhaps with transduction in mind we might venture to say that rather than things having feelings or sensitivities to an environment, entities have types of forces that can pass through them, that can transduce them, activating phasings.
