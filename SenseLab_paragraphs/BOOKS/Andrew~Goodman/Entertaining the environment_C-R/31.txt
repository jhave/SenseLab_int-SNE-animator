All this, I want to suggest, is perhaps a step towards a new politics of art. That is, clearly, this has nothing to do with the representation of an ‘issue’, but instead attempts to engage in the creation of lines of flight, with the composing of, as Massumi says, techniques for inventing (new) potentials for existence56. This is an ecological approach in that it is a politics of art that activates ‘an attentiveness to life and the field’, to the conditions of the event expressing itself57, an ontogenetic technicity58 for living. This is not a politics of ecology in the usual sense, rather an ecology-in-the-making: a body-becoming environment, environment-becoming-body. Its politics lies in attention to the felt continued emergence from which neither body nor field can be detached, the experience of a trans-human, lively world in the widest possible sense.
