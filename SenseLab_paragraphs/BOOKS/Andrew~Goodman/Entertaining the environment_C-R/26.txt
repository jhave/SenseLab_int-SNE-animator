Arakawa & Gins’ work shows how bodying makes ‘landing sites’, mobile points of connection penetrating the world, dispersing body and intertwining with environment. Caminhando is just such a procedure, giving rise to new microbrains: in the hands/scissors, in the ears/eyes/paper and so on. The event is a technique to reach into the world, transducing the body into emergent assemblages, to spark new individuations. Individuation implies that one is both dephasing as an individual, and simultaneously more, always suspended in the process of phasing, of ongoing concrescence, a future-present paradox. The art event opens up a gap in the subject, that moment of felt phasing creates a flight path: choose here, if you dare, not to person, but to embrace multiplicity, to accent individuation over personhood. Replace the frozen individual with the flows of forces, multiplicities of times; more a diagram-ing than a thing, with a dynamic relation to the virtual, ‘the combination of mutating fluxes, on their productions of speed’, become a biogram even:
play[ing] at the interstice of individuation and singularity, trembling on the resonant circuit of the virtual/actual now of pure experience . . . the body not as content but as a crystal or potential.
