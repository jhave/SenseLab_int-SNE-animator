To begin with, agency, it seems to me, is at best a problematic term, filled with nostalgic longing for transcendence. “Agency’ has a tendency to imply the primacy of ‘agents’ – discrete stable entities positively exerting force (that is, more than simply reacting to the world), while somehow in themselves remaining internally immune to it. Even those seeking to position agency beyond the human tend to think in those terms – actor network theory at its most programmatic, for example, or Pickering’s language in The mangle of practice of ‘resistance and accommodation’ and the ‘capturing’ of agency, staged as a kind of epic battle of wills between scientist and material world. How then to think ontogenetically, to think agency as a more radical, primary force, shaping entities as well as the relation between them, not as a force to be distributed amongst entities as such, but a co-emergent force, making and in the making of entities: a ‘system of intensities’ that is the event. How then to think in the language of forces, how to think the transformation of these forces as they move through entities? How to think affects that flow across entities/bodies that are always caught in between, in the (always) emergent/immanent, both phasing and de-phasing simultaneously, in ‘future-past’ relation.
