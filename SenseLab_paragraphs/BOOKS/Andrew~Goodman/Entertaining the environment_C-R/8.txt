In Vibrant matter Jane Bennett thinks such forces a ‘distributed agency’, a ‘swarm of vitality at play’. After Simondon we might also think it as a process of transduction. Transduction, Simondon says, is a process by which we can understand individuation. Individuation ‘operates beneath all forms [and] is inseparable from a pure ground that it brings to the surface’, it is an ongoing and in itself multiple process that underlies individualization. Individuation is the ‘more than of becoming’ (Massumi, in Manning: 9) - becomings being dephasings of ongoing field-entity relations, singular expressions of   larger ecologies of forces. Transduction then is the process by which such ‘an activity sets itself in motion’ at the same time as it generates ‘processes of modification’. It is, for Simondon, a way of understanding and expressing the relation of pre-individualization to individualization in ontogenetic terms.
