In her recent writing and art production, Erin Manning has proposed two concepts, that of ‘entraining’ and ‘entertaining’ the environment3, as a way of thinking through Whitehead’s two perceptual categories in relation to the phases of perception in the art event, that of “causal efﬁcacy”, and “presentational immediacy”4. ‘Entrainment’, Manning says, concerns the ‘immanently relational intertwining of perception with action’. Isabelle Stengers explains causal efficacy as a construction of chains of cause and effect, often based on prior knowledge or habitual response to sense data  – a succinct description, though perhaps is something of a simplification of the potential of causal efficacy, which might also be thought of as a ‘lure’ towards prehension, ‘call(ing) forth new immanent associations and new assemblages’6 – a more slippery operation with much potency (?) in an artistic setting. ‘Entertainment’, on the other hand, is indifferent to such concerns7, rather it is the process by which an art event might ‘place us immediately in a relational framework rather than investing in the hierarchy of subject and object’, concentrating on ‘the direct perception of the ﬁelding of experience such that it brings its qualitative resonances to the fore’8. It is this potential for a perception of the processes by which causal efficacy folds into the presentational immediacy to provide a sense of the ‘withness of the body (as) an ever present’9, a felt resonance with environmental fields that the changes in affective tonality that are produced by processes of transduction activate that I wish to unpack here through an examination of Lygia Clark’s propositional art work  “Caminhando” (1963), concentrating on the transductive potential of an opening of the body to a wider field of distributed agency to produce a suspension in-process, a moment of slippage, which evokes a sensation of being, as Manning says ‘always more than’ a subject10.
