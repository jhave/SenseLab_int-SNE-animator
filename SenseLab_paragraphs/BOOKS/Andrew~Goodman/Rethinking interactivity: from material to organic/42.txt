Live’s midi connections are highly flexible and most operational parameters can be linked to MIDI.  Link a clip to a movement trigger, and you initiate a simple cause and effect relation. This can be complicated through building into the design multiple potential relations. For example, other sensor events might potentially turn off the clip, and/or swap it for a different sound, and/or modulate its volume so that it might be inaudible or dominant, and so on. In such relatively simple ways we move from a linear causation of relation of movement =sound (realization of the possible), to multiple complex potential events intermeshed within a nexus of relations, the ‘noise’ of disruption a continual force moving the process into reconfiguration. Nexūs of relations here can be seen to begin to operate not just as independently self-satisfying, but also as complexly and fluidly inter-related through disjunctive events of emergence, as potential noise within relations, constructing through disrupting. This enriched connection to the virtual proposes relation as more than just complex vector relations of physical interdependence.
