What are our expectations of interactive art forms? Perhaps that it expands the range of art experiences available to the audience, offering levels of ‘free choice’ and embodied experience seemingly lacking in more traditional art forms; that it will be participatory on some level unavailable in the supposedly more passive enjoyment of traditional forms; and that it will be experiential rather than representational. The existence of some essential qualitative - and indeed moral - judgment of difference between the ‘interactive’ and ‘non-interactive’ forms by proponents of interactivity has often been promoted. Simone Osthoff’s argument might be cited, for example, that Lygia Clark’s work utilizes the viewer’s own energy, synthesizes mind and body and explores the sensorial, and replaces the object with the experience – all in ways that painting and sculpture cannot [14] Stoichita’s statement that in Lozano-Hemmer’s work ‘(w)e are no longer before the (interactive) work, we are in the work’ [4], or Roy Ascott’s claim of ‘moving beyond the object’, from observed effect to participation, and elsewhere that participatory art is the opposite of ‘traditional’ forms that distance one from the process [1], all can imply some kind of moral superiority in the interactive.
