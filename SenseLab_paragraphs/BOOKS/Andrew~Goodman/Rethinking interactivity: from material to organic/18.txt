Massumi argues that interactivity describes a simple back and forth between two elements that remain discrete and stable [3]. That is, in this context, it is a material view of the world in which I am a stable subject and the art work a stable object, both transcendent of the event of our encounter. But in the ‘Whiteheadian’ universe of organic philosophy the scenario is very different. Any notion of an ‘enduring substance sustaining persistent qualities’ [22] is replaced by an actual entity as a ‘process…not describable in terms of the morphology of “stuff”.’2 These actualized entities are atomic. That is, they do not change in themselves; rather they exist only in the instance of their becoming, perishing in actualization to be replaced by new actualizations (which we may or may not chose to view from certain perspectives as being ostensibly the same): an endless advance towards intensity and invention. Viewed thus, ‘objects’ are endpoints in processes of concrescence of complex events of relation, and a ‘subject’ (or ‘superject’, as Whitehead prefers) arises out of experience rather than interacting with a world that it somehow remains transcendent of [22].
