An entity, Whitehead states, ‘feels as it does feel in order to be the actual entity it is’ [22]. The propositions composed within the art event, are launching points, ‘lures towards feelings’. These feelings are none other than the prehensions [22] -internal again - whose drive toward satisfaction is the realization of some potentiality of the entity. ‘Feelings’ in the sense of prehensions are not necessarily anything to do with conscious thought. Rather they are a drive towards completion of an occasion. Thus an inanimate entity might be seen as being just as capable of a feeling, as driven towards its own satisfaction, as a sentient one. A sensor, for example, in itself might have the proposition of a tendency to notice movement. This may not happen, it is a potentiality, constrained by the given – its position, the mechanics of its construction, and so on. It has ’sensitivity’ towards searching for this movement, the incoming sense data that drive its completion, its satisfaction in that instance as a movement sensor – whether it actually senses movement or not (exclusive potentials that in that in any occasion only one can be actualized while the other remains virtual).
