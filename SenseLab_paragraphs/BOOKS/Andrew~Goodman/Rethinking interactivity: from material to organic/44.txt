This then is a topological web of relations, self modulating and designed as much for potential perishing as connections, primed for necessary injections of chaos through its multiply entangled chains of cause and effect. Again, such tinkering represents both small, seemingly inconsequential moderations, and at the same time, I would argue, a paradigm shift: the death of the (software) author to be replaced by the propositional event. The artist proposes sound events, in excess of possible actuality. With causality dispersed, notions of an artist or software ‘agent’ are replaced by a co-causal ‘agency’ (that is, a subject replaced by process). Within such simple tactics we begin to see sounds within the system becoming free floating events inhabiting a virtual soundscape - sounds as societies vibrating internally and externally with the tensions of relation - they begin to hum with difference and potential.
