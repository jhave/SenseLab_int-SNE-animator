Such an everyday act is saturated with complexity and invention, and rich with potential. But now imagine you are in a gallery, in some interactive installation. Things happen as you move around – sounds, lights, video or whatever. Perhaps once triggered by your presence the work pretty much does its own thing, perhaps it continues to develop as you engage. Either way, it so often lacks the complexity, intertwined-ness of body and work, the perceptual nuance, the fluidity, surprising originality of connection and thickness of experience of a simple walk outside. While at best the interactive experience might seek to expand awareness of the processes of perception and relation, in fact it too often remains programmatic, lacking in subtle and surprising combinations of memories, affects, sensations and prehensions. This is not to suggest that interactive art’s role is to mimic life, but rather that many such works display a paucity of life’s rich, heightened experience of connection and possibility.
