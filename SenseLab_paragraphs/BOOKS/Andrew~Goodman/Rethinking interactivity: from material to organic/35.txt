The ‘society’ that is the artwork assemblage can endure because new entities emerging within the art-assemblage conform to common feelings – their emergence is shaped in part by their relation to the society [19]. That is, although they retain potential to change, drift towards some semblance of stability is still possible. How then might a continuous and vigorous drive towards reinvention be structured into the event/s? Rather than just concentrate on the agency of the event to establish layers of relation, how can their perishing and replacement also be driven internally? To become an event that gains the power of continual self-invention of the everyday experience rather than one that drifts to a point of stasis requires a system that is able to include not just connectivity, but disconnections, failed, disruptive, competing and destructive relations and account for interference in the communications. Michel Serres proposes that ‘noise’ – that is, the interference in a relation – is a necessary condition of its existence, stating that ‘if a relationship succeeds, if it is perfect, optimum and immediate; it disappears as a relation’ [18]. That is, relations are a condition of difference in a system or assemblage rather than arising out of harmony or equilibrium. Relations are full of ‘losses, flights, wear and tear, errors, accidents, opacity’ that are their creativity, Serres states, and a system of ‘pure rationality’, without such excesses, interferences and disruptions is in essence a fascist system [18].
