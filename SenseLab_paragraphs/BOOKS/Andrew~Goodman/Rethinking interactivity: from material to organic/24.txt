But for the practicing artist, engaged with an interactive, generative or what we might now term ‘relational’ art practice, questions of how to structure or enable fluidity and maximize open-ended potentiality in practical terms is still problematic. How to structure so as allow for multiple, surprising outcomes, and how to create organic movement – the complex flow of prehension, synthesis and perishing pursued endlessly by further such creation – remains a question. For we cannot ignore structure - chaos in itself does not seem to me an answer, neither is mimicry of the everyday. Rather the special thickness of experience and the surprise of unusual connection and revelation that the art event can offer needs to be retained without losing the kind of underlying complexity and entanglement of everyday experiential involvement in the world.
