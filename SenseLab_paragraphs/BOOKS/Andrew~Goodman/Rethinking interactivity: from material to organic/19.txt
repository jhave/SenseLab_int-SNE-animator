As in life in general, the artwork here is the encounter: art is an event of relations. This notion of relationality, Massumi says, addresses objects and bodies from the point of view of their ability to change and respond – ‘a coming together in a fusional event…a telescoping into a potential becoming’ [3]. That is, rather than operating as ‘establishment and reproduction of an ordered relay’ [3], the relational is an immediate, ‘emergent process’ where something new occurs out of the relations [12]. Thus Lozano-Hemmer’s insistence that his work is not interactive but ‘relational’ [2] - focused not on the fixed or mechanical elements of interaction, but on the potential for establishing relations, that always have an immanent, virtual quality to them. Relations are always improvisational, fluid and emergent, Manning states [7], a ‘becoming’ connectivity. So I might now seek to address the ‘event’ of the connections rather than the work as a stable object – the way relations develop between – or create - my body and the work, a ‘mutual incipiency’, a process of change and response [3]. Manning and Massumi use the term ‘co-causal’ [12] to describe this mutual emergence of the new through the flux of the forces of relations. Varela’s use of ‘enaction’ similarly describes such events of relations between the world and body as events of mutual creation, neither wholly internal nor external. This is a ‘co-determined’ world rather than a stable environment that one is ‘parachuted into’ [20].
