Imagine for a moment that you are out walking in the street. To go for such a walk is to create through the endless flow of interaction. Bodily and spatially, each step – and indeed within each step – perceptual, sensorial and social possibilities are opened up, assemblages of forces gathered, altered and reconnected, complexities multiplied, memories activated. The moment is saturated with affectual relations and intensities. With the fall of the same step, previous possibilities perish, simultaneously propelling the endless opening of fresh possibilities of connection [7]. Try to map all the relations that go to make up one instant – one occasion: within your body, between body and world, mind and body, object and object and so on. You will have to consider subatomic, atomic and molecular forces with their general disregard for what we view as discreet bodies. You will want to account for the way texture and gradient of the terrain shapes movement, rhythm and posture and how sensory perception - vision and hearing and so on – begin to ready the body for the next step; how the force of physical habits – body memory – shape patterns of movement in the present moment. Present also will be all the events of relation that have gone into making each tree, stone, person or sound you are interacting with, effecting your body more or less forcefully. And so on. Then there are the mental forces – ‘inextricably intertwined’ [22] with the physical - memories, anticipations, random associations made and forgotten, affects that will subtly or bluntly alter you, the myriad mental processes that sit below conscious perception yet nevertheless shape and reshape your body. Beyond that instant, in the next occasion, the concrescence of all these forces creates anew this simple act of walking the street. It is a constant, complexly enmeshed act of creativity: when we look honestly all things, as Whitehead says, are vectors of relations [22].
