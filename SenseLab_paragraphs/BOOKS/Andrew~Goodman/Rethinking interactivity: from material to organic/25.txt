Any such discussion of practicalities is necessarily propositional. Indeed, speculation – a drive towards an unknown conclusion – might be seen here as an advantage: inherently part of any technique interested more in establishing lines of flight than destinations. Think of it more as a kind of meta-modeling – an attempt to create potential tools for multiple usages, with the understanding that different combinations of techniques must be assembled to address each singular artistic problem [21]. Meta-modeling, Guattari says, ‘abandon(s) all universalizing pretensions’ involves a disentangling of oneself from systems of modeling that ‘pollute our ways of thinking’ [21], creating instead a contingent critical ‘bricolage’ of possible approaches to be utilized for the particular analysis at hand.
