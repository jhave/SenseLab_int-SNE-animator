This paper examines the limitations that a materialist approach to interactivity has imposed on the genre, creating a disjunction between the richness and complexity of life experiences and the linear, representational nature of interactive art. The author proposes that a shift to an organic philosophy provides a method of accounting for the fluid complexity of relational forces composing an art event, and examines drift and noise as two strategies by which the artist might begin to structure a distributed creative agency within the event.
