Any artwork, in this psychological sense, might be read as loosely ‘generative’, in that on some levels an individual experience still emerges from the combination of viewer and work that in its singularity inevitably begins to escape the confines of the artist’s control. Interactivity can struggle to allow such excessive layering and complicating of dialogues. That is, the interaction is often necessarily productive - lacking the multitude of virtual potentials, interactions struggle to become excessive, to outstrip function and destabilize orderly systems of exchange. It is perhaps no wonder that interactive technologies and displays sit so comfortably in didactic museum displays. Ironically the very participation that in art is intended to free the viewer from constraints operates effectively to direct and lecture them. As Massumi argues, to utilize such technologies in a becoming, emergent fashion they need to be freed from ‘use-value’ or ‘exchange-value’, move beyond ‘prodding a participant to gain a response’, and take on a more speculative nature [11].
