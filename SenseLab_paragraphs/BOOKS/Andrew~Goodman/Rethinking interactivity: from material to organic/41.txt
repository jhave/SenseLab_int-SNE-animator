Live is designed make multiple loops conform to a set tempo – an external stable structuring - so as a first step we might consider the possibility of allowing instead a rhythmic drifting. Live organizes sound clips both inclusively and exclusively: multiple tracks arranged horizontally can play simultaneously, while each track contains multiple clips arranged vertically that are exclusive of each other. Thus simultaneously sounds operate in both a compossible (‘and, and, and…’) manner horizontally and an incompossible (‘or, or, or…’) manner vertically - this is already the beginning of a potential network structuring. A dispersed rhythmic structuring can be initiated by turning off the quantization function for each clip so that they begin playing as soon as triggered. Now externally driven, incidental rhythms arise out of the internally generated tension of multiple loops – an outcome of multiple relational events, a contingent structuring rather than a centrally organizing rhythm as an architect of sounds; rhythm as an expression of difference, an elasticity ‘stretching towards’ an unknown next [7].
