On a practical design level, the implications might involve firstly the acknowledgment and encouragement of a wider range of disruptive relations, and secondly the construction of software and generative events with the inbuilt potential to interrupt and distort each other. The first of these factors involves coming to an understanding of ways in which sensorial, affective and social relations affect the actual individuated experience in any event. That is, for example, understanding how the emotional tonality I bring to an event will colour my experience, magnifying some aspects, minimizing or negating others, connecting one experience to memories; or the disruption my movements bring to any stability of software/sensor relations; or how the vibrations of sounds felt through the floor will complicate the sense information gained through the ears; or how the affective tonality of the room alters with the arrival of another body, creating a hyper awareness or ‘transparency’ of temporality and my body in relation to the event, making me hyperconscious of my posture, disrupting my image of myself. And so on, and so on... While on one level banal or obvious, the exploitation and enhancement of these naturally slippery relations brings to the event a natural unpredictability to any planned interaction – continual subtle re-tunings of relations that modulate and invent. Secondly, as explored in the next section, in the more overtly concrete design of software or sensor technologies for interactive works, factoring in potential perishings or negations becomes as important as the establishment of possible relation.
