Thus it is a system of internally organizing and foregrounding the roles of instability and of difference in creation, embracing the possibilities of disruption as well as connection. It is a (self-organizing) multiplier of relations – it bifurcates any stable exchange, as a derivation from equilibrium it has an ‘abuse-value’ rather than exchange-value [18] to create new relationships through the eruption of difference; difference that ‘recharges the activity of relating from which all experience emerges’, Massumi states, to be seen not as deconstruction, but ‘continued construction. Reconstruction on the fly. Not interruption: recharging, resaturation with potential’ [9]. This implies creating a propositional structure where relations not only layer, but have also the inbuilt potential to interrupt each other. Whether such interruptions actualize is not the issue – even as virtual noise they create open-endedness: potential disruptions that nevertheless can create a tension, act on any actualized relation to keep it provisional, on the point of change or collapse. Each virtual configuration of the parasite introduces excess, something interesting and complicated to the relationship, keeps it on the verge of the event of expansion or transformation, and multiplies its virtual qualities rhizomically. As Massumi says, ‘the virtual is the mode of reality implicated in the emergence of new potentials…its reality is the reality of change: the event’ [10].
