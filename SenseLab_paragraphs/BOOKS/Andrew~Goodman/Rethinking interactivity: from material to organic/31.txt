And, although we might chose for conveniences sake to think of the art event as a single entity, it is perhaps better viewed as a ‘society’3 of entities, divisible into multiple, overlapping and simultaneous events or entities, each seeking – and competing – for its own satisfaction. That is, during events of concrescence it is always at a point of unfolding, facing multiple potential paths towards the various satisfactions. Multiple, fluid assemblages of eyes/brain/image, ears/noise/speakers/current, software/ sensor/movement data and so on, are each in themselves divisible again, each seeking resolution of their feelings. Such art events might begin with multiple proposals, luring even greater multitudes of prehensions, held in both inclusive and exclusive relation to each other, seeking – competing even – for their satisfaction, driven that is by the creative urge to turn potential into actual. This philosophical stance emphasizes most forcefully that art events are composed from ground up, with an understanding that the concrescence of forces builds towards an endpoint of an actual event, discovered and motivated within the occasion itself by complexities of virtual and actual forces.
