Is there really open-ended decision making in generative or interactive art?  In her essay entitled ‘Interactivity means interpassivity’, Mona Sarkis argues that the participant in interactive art remains a passive ‘user’, assembling the artist’s vision without any real free choice [17]. De Mèridieu likewise warns that ‘we should not delude ourselves: interactivity can conceal programmed actions and predetermined pseudo-choices’ [13]. Massumi also cautions that interactive works can dictate an involvement and proscribe possibilities [11], and Lev Manovich describes the rise of interactive art as a shift from representation to manipulation [5]. Here the question of (free) choice seems to be, as Peacock argues, one on which the success and failure of interactivity commonly balances, stating that ‘(d)ecision making of some kind is a necessary condition of the interactive’ [15].
