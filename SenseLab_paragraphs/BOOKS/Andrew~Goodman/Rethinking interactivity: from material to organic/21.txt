So in articulating the experience – the event of my body’s temporary and temporal co-causal relations with a work I might view the artwork as an ‘technique of relation’ [12] and be assessing its ability to act as an inventive catalyst for affective co-causal relations to arise. Now we have changed the creative emphasis to the enabling of change, and abandoned control of outcomes in favour of propositional launching points. In doing so whole series of relational forces that resist any practical control might be brought into play to complicate and activate invention within the work. My concentration is now on the buildup of energy and rhythm between and within body and work; how the event moves beyond a mapping of simple cause and effect (move this way, a particular sound occurs), into something that has a ‘self-tendency, (a) life movement’ [12]. Now complex multiple actions and potential relations might catalyze a singular experience, perhaps moving beyond being able to be mapped or articulated. What is felt/perceived here in the moment might be more intensities of pure sensation, a building of energies expressed through combinations of movement, sound, image, posture and so on – but also potentially contradictory affectual relations that push and pull at the body; a kind of psychologically topological experience, being manipulated into different tonalities by the ever reconfiguring connections.
