How does the art event ‘chose’ which prehensions it follows through to satisfaction, which entities will actualize? Having set itself into motion through its propositional structuring and gained through feeling its own agency, it is not beholden to any external intentions or drive – it must sort itself out internally. But it does not strive to be the best event it can – the most efficient, original or surprising. That would again imply some kind of transcendent motivation. Rather, we could say, it drifts. ‘Drift’, as Varela says, implies a system that makes do – it seeks the ‘viable’ rather than the ‘optimal’ [20], it is ‘pragmatic’, its motivation is to find a satisfaction, not the satisfaction, it makes do with what it has, cobbles together a solution. Enabling a process of drift ‘takes the place of task oriented design’, Varela argues [20], it implies a system which is truly interactive – both within itself and its given circumstances – composed through that activity rather than representative of determined function or outcome
