This might be thought of as self evident, useless information. After all, if all things are composed from events of relation, are not all artworks thus composed, regardless of the artist’s intentions? I would argue, however, that the way many interactive works in fact operate is to attempt to stabilize such unfoldings, erase the connections to the virtual – the future potential for immergence – and establish enduring actualized connections. With the shift in emphasis proposed I am no longer thinking of creating a stable artwork, but as an emergent or potential (that is, virtual) event that may occur or is occurring. What exists beforehand might be thought of as a proposition for an event, but it exists as an event only in a temporal relationship (or rather as a nexus of relationships) with the viewer, enfolded and unfolded through interaction, each nexus creating a singular event. Embodied enaction is always directed towards the ‘next’, the continuing evolution of the event [20], and therefore towards the virtual. Such events create body-artwork assemblages – contingent networks of interconnections, with multiple, unplanned, potentially contradictory variables of relation.
