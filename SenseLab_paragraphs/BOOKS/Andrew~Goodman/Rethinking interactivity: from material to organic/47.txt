The point, I might argue, to a shift from material to organic modeling of the interactive event, is in a sense to not have a point: to rescue such art-events from purposefulness, to encourage growth, mutation and destruction without predetermination, to enable an event to generate its own forces of concrescence and find its own satisfaction. This implies not an absence of artistic input in any negative sense, but a shift towards propositional, speculative structuring with an emphasis on the intensification of experienced relation.
