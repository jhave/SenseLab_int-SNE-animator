Perhaps participatory works might claim a certain freedom from representational content - aiming more for a visceral experience that narration, contemplation or reflection. In one sense it is true that a painting’s content is all constructed prior to encounter with the viewer, dictated by the artist and waiting to be read. However even in the most didactic, narrative driven image there presents the possibility – one could argue even inevitability – for a freedom of association, that is, for myself as a viewer to link elements I see to memories. Personal (and cultural) associations are inevitable, whether a colour that reminds me of a flag, facial features I associate with a friend, lighting effects that somewhere in my brain trigger memories of a half forgotten film, muscle memory or a prehension of movement made conscious through an association with a figure’s awkward pose. This is not simply a reviving of old memories, but actualization of virtual memory that creates new thought within the event, exactly the kind of ‘interaction’ that fits with Manovich’s argument that the notion of interactivity must become inclusive of notions of psychological processes, mental as well as physical or temporal connections [6].
