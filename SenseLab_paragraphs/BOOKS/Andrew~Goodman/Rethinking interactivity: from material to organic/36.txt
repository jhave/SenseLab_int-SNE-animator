Serres’ concept of the parasite presents a potential mechanism to complicate and expand the idea of co-causality. The parasite here has multiple meanings, being both a literal parasite, feeding off the energy (physical or social) of another, but also more importantly meaning the noise in the system of relations4. Now too there is a ‘noise’ in the system – the parasite – to propose. The parasite is essentially creative in that it forces into existence new logic, new combinations, and new orders of exchange [18]. It turns one type of energy into another, turns body movement into electrical current, software computations into sound, image into psychological discomfort. It disrupts communications, but produces something else (excessive) through its (mis)translation of relations. This third position in the system is itself unstable; the roles are interchangeable, fluid - each position is potentially noise for the other two - they lie in between any absolute or fixed position, always fuzzy and multiple; contradictory and irresolvable [18].
