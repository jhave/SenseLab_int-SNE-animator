A relational artwork capable of such drift might take many forms, creating many differing events. This does not mean that it drives towards making events necessarily different  - it is indifferent to the quality or quantity of difference it generates, indifferent to the demonstration of change and relation that haunts so many interactive works. It settles where it settles. Perhaps some days the events generated would be markedly variable, on others it might seem to settle around the same outcomes. Change to one parameter, one tiny force operating within the assemblage might result in a complete turn around, little noticeable change or be negated by some other factor and perish unnoticed. But the artist relinquishes control over this, leaving it – encouraging it – to work itself out: it does what it does, whether disappointing one occasion, surprising the next.
