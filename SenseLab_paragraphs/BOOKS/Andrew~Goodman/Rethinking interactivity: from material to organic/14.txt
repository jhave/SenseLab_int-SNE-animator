What space for contemplation does the interactive installation allow? The curse of interactivity, like video art, is that often I must either abandon midway through boredom, endure to a set endpoint or at least move through in a set order. Here the ‘empowerment’ that Ascott claims for interactivity, allowing the ‘individual to participate fully in the workings of the system’ [1] can be rather like the participation in riding a train: certainly I am bodily involved in the machinations of travel, but with limited entrance and exit points and heading inexorably in a prescribed direction. It’s a kind of roller-coaster ride experience that that contains a certain level of visceral thrill but that can also, as Poissant notes, ‘enclose one into a schema of manipulation rather than propose a real space for dialogue’ [16]. The risk is that my movements loose their incipient, ‘becoming’ qualities, and there is the possibility in participatory works such of merely ‘performing the software’ [7].
