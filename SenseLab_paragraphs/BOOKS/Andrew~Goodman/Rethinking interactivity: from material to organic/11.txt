Can interactivity really offer more – or even as much choice as, for example, a painting - can it offer as many options to the viewer either in the way they assimilate content or in the choices of levels of involvement in the work? Even an exhibition of paintings might offer the viewer fairly free reign in their manner of experiencing the space: the choice to skim over some works, view them in any order, dip in and out of concentration and so on – all fairly banal choices that one would take for granted. Interactive works, on the other hand, often require a high level of participation to achieve any presence. As Massumi notes, ‘it is important to remind ourselves that there can be a kind of tyranny to interaction’ [11]. That is, it is not necessarily liberating to dictate a level of involvement, in itself a kind of operation of power over the viewer that the artist exercises that needs to be recognized. We should not forget, as Manning warns, that the sensory technologies at the base of many interactive works have ‘problematic pasts, both as displacers of the corporeal body and in assemblages of control’ [8], and, while many artists who utilize surveillance technologies claim to be displacing the power dynamics by making art with such tools of control, they may retain such potential in the artist’s hands - hardly a paradigm shift.
