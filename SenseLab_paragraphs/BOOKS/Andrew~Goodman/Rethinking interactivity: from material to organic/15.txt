Ascott contends that interaction can become trivial, in a closed, linear system with finite data [1] – a flicking of an ‘on’ switch with my presence, a prompting of a software program to jump to the next prearranged scene, as in a video game. This is often in sad contrast to everyday lived experience with its endless emergent qualities. These qualities, Manning argues, are a building elasticity of virtual potential, such as the mental and physical prehensions and pre-accelerations that shape the actuality of a movement [7], resolving such tensions - a ‘satisfaction’ of the prehension [23]. This physical/psychological connection seems to me the kind of visceral involvement that is often lacking in programmatic interactive art. The excess of the virtual is replaced by the probable, open endedness by specific purposes. The art that announces itself as interactive too often limits itself through its dedication to the representation or demonstration of its interactivity, and its insistence on demarcating a stable zone of relation between two discrete bodies – the viewer and their environment.
