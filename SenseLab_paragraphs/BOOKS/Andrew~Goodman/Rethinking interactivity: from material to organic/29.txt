Think first of the making of a relational artwork as the building up of propositions. These propositions might be multiple, possibly contradictory. If sound ‘A’ can happen, or sound ‘B’, but not both sounds, the sound not actualized still has, as Whitehead says, a creative role to play – both as a ‘giveness’ that shapes paths of potentiality, and as a continuing link to the virtual. The negated proposition remains a link to what might of happened, to unrealized potential that ‘vibrate(s) against the conformal’ [22]. Propositions then provide ongoing links towards the potentialities of the event, to a ‘second phase’ of the virtual: its ‘real’ potentiality rather than the ‘general’ potentiality [22], conditioning the potential by inclusion of the circumstances of the emergent event: those selected by the artist (layout, software, sounds, images, shapes and so on), plus what the participants bring (physical capabilities, tastes, moods), plus then, to varying and probably lesser extents, the worldly circumstances surrounding the art event (culture, politics, geography, art histories, weather or what ever), which then create its virtual milieu.
