To me, this is a continuing disappointment that cannot be simply explained away by accusing any particular artist of a lack of imagination. Thus in this paper while I intend to briefly cover some of the common criticisms of the limitations – experientially and ethically – of interactive art, I wish to move beyond such critique to what I would argue is the underlying philosophical problem: the denial of the fundamentally fluid  ‘vector’ nature of interaction. It is this issue that I believe underlies the narrowness of both the invention and critique of interactive art – a ‘narrowness in the selection of evidence’ as Whitehead might argue [22] - which in its attempts to reduce the field of discussion to a manageable stability, succeeds only in denying the actual nature of the event. My discussion draws heavily on Massumi and Manning’s thinking on the shift from interaction to relationality1, which I have attempted to extend through concepts of drift and noise in order to extrapolate practical methods by which relation might continue its drive towards novelty in the interactive artwork.
