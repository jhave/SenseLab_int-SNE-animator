It might seem apt here to demand more from the interactive artist (and critic): more complexity, more imagination and more inventive. Of course more creativity will always have its place, but the problem underlying interactive artworks’ limitations lies primarily, I would argue, in the philosophical conception of an object, a subject and a work of art. Whitehead’s methodology is to re-invent the field of the problem in order to find a new solution. Following this I want to ask here how might we think (and construct) a field of interactive art so as to encourage the fluidity and layered inventiveness that might now be lacking?
