Whitehead’s philosophy offers the vocabulary to describe these dynamic, emergent and complex events of relation, which, he argues, cannot be conceived as static, stratified ‘stuff’, they can only exist in the unfolding of their eventness. The task for the artist, from this standpoint, is to steer interactivity back from an artificially stable plain towards the propositional, and to invent ways to keep the event, the temporal experience of participation, unstable, keep assemblages fluidly creative. Here perhaps discourse can move beyond questions of chance and freedom that hound interactivity to death, and focus on the ‘eventness’ of participation rather than demonstration of its mechanics, in ways that are capable of opening up to excess and disorder, embracing the complexity of movement, sensation and affect that is the nature of embodied experience.
