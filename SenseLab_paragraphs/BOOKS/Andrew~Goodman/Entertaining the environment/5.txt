The question of how to think beyond the human, as O’Sullivan states, is not as simple as a turning away from the human. Rather it is ‘a kind of stretching or twisting [of the human], a rupturing and stammering, a releasing of forces from within and the contact of forces that are without (both in fact being the same operation)’14, that is being considered here. This paper attempts to ‘think with’ Manning’s concept of entertaining the environment in order to unpack the experience of Lygia Clark’s 1963 work Caminhando, concentrating on its potential for the opening of the body to a wider field of agency, and for the production of a phasing, a moment of slippage, a crack in which to escape oneself.
