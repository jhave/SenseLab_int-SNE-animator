Of course, ‘environment’ here has nothing to do with concepts of ‘nature’, nor, with environment as content – the environment as a distinct separate system for a subject to gaze upon, discuss or traverse, nor  ‘environmentalism’ in the sense of something to be rescued from the human. Rather, I would argue, it reflects a more radical view, that of environment, including what remains of the human, as pure process – autopoetic system – in line with Felix Guattari’s concept of ecosophy11, a generalized ecology that ‘questions the whole of subjectivity and capitalistic power formations’12. As Manning says, ‘to feel ecologically is to directly perceive the relations out of which space-time is composed. Perceiving environmentally does not imply giving meaning to form, but forming environmentally’13.
