Transduction describes the integration of formerly disparate things within a concrete system, that is, the evolution of a shared associated milieu. It is, in simpler terms, how the becoming of an entity generates further unfoldings: how ‘formative force becomes form to become force again’22, thought not as a linear progression but rather series of overlapping, always transforming forces, thus driving ongoing individuation. Whitehead similarly describes such a process as a system of concrescence and continuity: an entity having achieved satisfaction (the completion of its own process of concrescence), becomes an ‘object’ for other entities, an ‘external resonance’, its prehension initiating/conditioning their unfolding concrescence23. This (again) Whitehead describes not as a simple linear process. An entity is a window onto the world - a monad - that has a relation to every other actualized entity, by whatever degree of separation and whether prehended positively of negatively24. In such a complex and intertwined system the transduction triggering prehension must be seen as more a vast nexus of complex forces than a simple cause and effect paradigm.
