We must talk of verbs here, as Deleuze says31, not nouns to escape. Process can only be described, and even then inadequately, through infinitive verb forms: assembling, person-ing (from ‘what can a body do’, ‘to what is bodying doing?’).  Lines of flight are not waiting to be discovered - they must be performed. Escape not through a crack but through a process of cracking. Think agencies, not agents, individuations not individuals, becoming not ever being, event not result. Art is event, not object: never more obvious than in Caminhando. ‘At the outset, the Trailing is only a potentiality’, Clark says32. The paper and the cutting are in themselves nothing, in the end the result is inconsequential and it leaves no real trace33, just scraps to be binned, of paper, of a persons. The art exists as a moment of resonate intensity, of prehended phasing, its beauty lying in the delicate capacity to activate and foreground transduction.
