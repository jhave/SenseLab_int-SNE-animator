In the late C18th the Abbé Nollet created entertainment by passing electric current from a Leyden Jar (an early battery prototype), through a line of 300 Carthusian monks holding hands, causing them to simultaneously jump in the air1. This was one of a series of early experiments exploring a fascination with this newly discovered force in the world, capable of passing through and rearranging bodies and objects. Such works demonstrate a in a shift in positioning the human and environment: an enthusiasm for an exploration of a distinctly non-human agency active in a lively world of forces and an entrancement with the capability of such forces to transverse and reorganize human body potential into a decidedly ‘post-human collective body/assemblage’2.
