Darkness (a detour)
Torn apart by sudden darkness, the self scatters, disappears in to the cracks. Body boundaries, organs, ego, go their own ways. Contingent assemblages begin to form – hand/surface, foot/shoe sole/gradient, ear/echo/thought, head/wall – there is a scramble to cobble together some kind of workable new ‘organ’ to make sense of the available data. But they remain disparate, loosely connected at best: floating. Free of central nervous system co-ordination and losing causal efficiacy, sense relations become ‘vague’, losing spatial definition yet retain and even amplify the emotional tonality25. No longer bound to an organism busy personing26, they conduct their own perceptual experiments in the art of bricolage – systems unencumbered by pre-constructed individuals. In such a space the whole body surface becomes a groping hand, skin feels the edge of an object – as a resistant force - gains information but never really knows the object – a edge could as well be a table, bookcase or doorway, nerves responds only to the immediacy of the hard flatness, reinventing the object and body in relation at the next cautious groping forward. Navigating in such conditions a certain tentativeness naturally arises, as Arakawa and Gins might say27, as both cause and affect of a body rearranging, reaching out and in to: in that sensitive, quiet turning out of ears, skin, awareness towards the environment, slowly seeking to gather fragments of information from all angles and sources, to assemble from the field.
