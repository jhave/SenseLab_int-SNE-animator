Clearly Process Philosophy views transduction as a ubiquitous event, enabling the ‘drive towards novelty’ of the universe that Whitehead describes. What then, differentiates Caminhando from the everyday? In some way it is that it makes felt the process of the translation of these forces. But it is not exactly that it makes the process ‘conscious’ in any articulate manner. Rather it is that it makes transduction felt as it slows down the process of phasing, provokes a suspension in the flow, makes evident the potentiality of the event, with opportunity for re-construction and invention.
