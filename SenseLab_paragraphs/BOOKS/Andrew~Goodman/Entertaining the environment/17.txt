Deleuze describes the perfectly simple world of the tick: three feelings, for height, warmth, blood, that allow it to navigate, to form workable assemblages, to become with its environment36. Such ‘Whiteheadian’ feelings are not necessarily conscious, they do not privilege sentience over inanimate beings. As Manning states, ‘Feeling is not attached to a form already taken’37, to preformed entities. Rather, think feeling as a force gathering towards form, immanent with the occasion, moving the event. Accept Whitehead’s challenge; carry this to its limit – beyond entities with attributes easy to anthropomorphize - beyond animals, and beyond plants and trees even. Ask instead: What does a rock feel? To which forces are its sensitivities tuned – to rain, salts, wind, tides, heat? How does the becoming form of the rock instigate new force - shape the wind, give new direction to the current, absorb or dissolve salt solutions? See the rock-world relation anew: the rock’s continued fielding in the world, the field’s continuous expression through the force of the rock, rock-world as an ecology of operations.
