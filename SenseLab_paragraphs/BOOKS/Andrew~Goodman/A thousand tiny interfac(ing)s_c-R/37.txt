With such a shift the machine developed new transductive potentials between the internal and external (the field), a ‘charged grounding’ of the two. That is, the connection of internal spacing and external contrast in dynamic virtual relation created a larger machine ecology [50], a ‘conversation’ between them that gave new dynamism to the event, another scale on which it was self-modulating. Not only the event, but also the field itself had changed. Re:Positioning Fear had changed its nature, not just by actualizing a previously un-actualized potential, but by rewriting the very field of potential available to it, generating emergent difference.
