Interfacing here might be seen to have incited a phase or register-shift through transduction, implicating the external. That is, a complexity beyond simple intensive disruption occurred. While the machine’s modulations were driven by the compossible actions of the bio-technical interfacing, these radical interfacings acted more significantly on the system. They were capable of rearranging both how the potential combinations actualized and of creating completely new milieus. More than modulating transduction, a new machine was produced from the field when the system passed a ‘threshold of [qualitative] intensity’, forcing new flows, with their attendant individuations, to begin.
