But in the case of Re:Positioning Fear, a more interesting and radical disruption occurred in the unfolding of this work (which was already primed for playful intervention and evolution). It was in this catalyzing moment when, through parasitic action, a new and more complex machine was produced. Alongside the positioning of their shadows on the fa√ßade to activate the hidden text, participants began to synthesize a different work out of the components by engaging specifically in play between their projected silhouettes. Here they utilized the potential to radically alter the size of their shadows to engage creatively with one another. For example, a wheelchair bound participant created a giant image of himself and ran down everyone else, while other participants played with puppet mastering smaller shadow bodies and with the making of multi-limbed combinatory beings .
