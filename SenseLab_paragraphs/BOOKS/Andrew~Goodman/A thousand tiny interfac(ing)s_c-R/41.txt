Interfacing here was propositional of differentiation, attuning the conditions for potential trans-force-form events; luring multiple transductive events into being. The event, one might say, answered Stern’s call for interactive art to move away from privileging signs and images at the interface and the demonstration or fetishization of the technology in the work. Instead it engaged, as Stern proposes, ‘with the quality and styles of movement’ that were performed, with the invention of (new) styles, with the implicit, the potential, to construct new ways of relating through interfacing.
