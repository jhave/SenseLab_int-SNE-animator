This free shadow play was, I would suggest, a kind of parasitic noise feeding off the energy already flowing through the work to create new paths, expressively, and to creatively bifurcate relations. That is, it was an action that both continued to qualitatively express something of the original relation (moving shadows revealing text on the buildingâ€™s surface), while at the same time producing a new relation through the same initial forms. The contemplative and reflective rhythm of movement in the large-scale text was overlaid with the noise of a quick and teasing play of shadows, creating a tension, a clash of intentions and tonalities: gaps and miscommunications.
