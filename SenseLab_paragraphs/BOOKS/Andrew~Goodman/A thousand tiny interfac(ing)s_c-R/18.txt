It is perhaps common to think of interfaces as translators of code, points of information exchange, from digital to analogue or visa versa, or as a ‘point of contact where humans and machines meet in order for exchange to take place’ . However to assert the primacy of the flow of forces rather than the secondary exchanges of text, transduction, I would argue, is a better way to fully think the event of interfacing. That is, as this paper will discuss below, transduction positions interfacing as the integration, through the flow of forces of differing viscosities, of formerly disparate things within a becoming-concrete system .
