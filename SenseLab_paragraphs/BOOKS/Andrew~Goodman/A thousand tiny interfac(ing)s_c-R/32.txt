But I want to suggest that the more radical folding occurring in the interruption of Re:Positioning Fear through the re-commissioning of the shadow making machine might be seen as a fold of the outside. The ‘outside’ here is force in non-relation [38] (itself a disruptive gap in the relational field), that ‘eats into the interval and forces or dismembers the internal’ . This can produce ‘trans-formation…to the composing forces, [which] enter in to a relation with the other forces which have come from the outside’ . The participants’ shadow-body play was an outside of the event (not a potential), which was folded into emergent relation, at the level of force as well as form. By trans-forming forces shaping the event this folding transformed the affects of the event, since affect is what is experienced in the transduction of force. The new affective tonality that was folded into the event coursed through, transducing, infecting all the systems constructing the event.
