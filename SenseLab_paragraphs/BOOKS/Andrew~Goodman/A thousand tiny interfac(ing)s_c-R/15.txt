Machines, as Guattari tells us, are any system that produces an effect; they function immanently and pragmatically . Massumi, in expanding on this notion, explains that they are  ‘not subordinate to utility or laws of resemblance’ . Guattari’s concept gives us three potentially useful ideas that help to expand the concept of the machine, in a decidedly non-humanist direction. Firstly, the need for an understanding of the role that the wider ecology in which technical objects are embedded (or with which they unfold) has in determining what potential is actualized. Machines here are ’proximity grouping[s]… [of] man-tool-animal’ . Secondly, an understanding Guattari perhaps shares with Simondon that machines inherently contain potential beyond their immediate actualization, ‘ontogenetic elements’ . That is, they are held together not so much by any physical bond, but by a shared virtual milieu, as an ‘assemblage of possible fields’ that develops through the process of concretization. Thirdly, that we must consider machines not through utility or representation, that is, as not being ‘limited to [their] materiality or functionality’ [18], but in terms of their productive capabilities. Guattari’s conception of the machinic here shifts the assemblage from ‘what is it composed from/what is it an aggregate of?’ to ‘what does it produce?’
