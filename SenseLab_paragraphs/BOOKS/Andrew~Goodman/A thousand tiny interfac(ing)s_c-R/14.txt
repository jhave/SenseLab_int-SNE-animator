In this paper, I am going to use the terms ‘body’ and technical object’ in specific ways. Following Katherine Hayle, the ‘body’ referred to here is in no way limited to the subject or to a fixed or post-individuated stable entity, but can be taken to be always in-process, corporeal and enactive rather than ‘the body’ in any coded sense . This is in sympathy with Deleuze and Guattari’s notion of a body as ‘a discontinuous, non-totalized series of processes, organs, flows, energies, corporeal substances and incorporeal events, intensities and durations’ . Similarly the term ‘technical object’ as used here implies not a fixed object in the material sense, but is used to address a technical or non-biological entity that is itself capable of becoming, leaving the term ‘machine’ open for another use.
