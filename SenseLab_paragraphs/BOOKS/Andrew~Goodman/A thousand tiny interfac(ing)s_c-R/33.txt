This outside, seen as the ‘incompossible’ (that which was excluded or divergent from the event), defined the limit of the event. Re:Positioning Fear had limits defining its concrescence both in the types of performances it produced and the potential from which it was drawn (various potential mutations of shadow playing with text, for example). The introduction of a whole new outside tactic of production through connections between participants co-composing relations together via the interfacing of their shadows then delimited the Re:Positioning Fear event. The tactic initiated new performances and fields of potential to compose with, even as it continued to drive towards its previously instigated concrescence. In redefining the limits and potential of the event, this folding of the incompossible was a more radically differential act. Such folding was, again, a positive generator of multiplicities of difference [44]. This difference was evident not particularly in a shift in the utility or materiality of the technical objects and other components of the assemblage, but as a force of qualitative change, of affective tonality. Interfacing here might be viewed as a vitality affect on a force, producing a felt moment of creative differing.
