The shifts that occur in Re:Positioning Fear as a result of interfacing were both materially (ontologically) slight and processually (ontogenetically) significant. What the participants brought to the event that instigated such a shift was in a sense no more than a new intention, or perhaps even less distinctively, a new tonality that infected the work to produce something new. This is not to suggest necessarily that what it shifted to was in itself significant, but that the way that interfacings performed such a shift was of philosophical and artistic interest, in that it provides a potential tactic towards the thinking of more autopoietic, and therefore open-ended systems of interactivity, suggesting a potential machinic, ‘minor’ art event, concerned less with signification than a collective becoming.
