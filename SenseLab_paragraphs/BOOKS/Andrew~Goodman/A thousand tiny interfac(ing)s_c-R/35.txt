I want to suggest that it was through these particular interfacings that the machine of Re:Positioning Fear underwent a process of concretization. Processes of concretization shift systems from a limited, linear or closed functioning towards self-regulation and sustenance, and, consequently, towards a ‘solidarity of openness’ (that is, an increase in self-generative capacities). Re:Positioning Fear shifted from a fairly linear production that was to a certain extent its externally instigated functioning, towards the self organization of a new event that was less reliant on the artist’s conception of the event or on the original conceived utility of the technical objects. That is, the system moved from a more ‘abstract’ configuration, to a self-modulating model. The work’s differential tension became an intrinsic component in its production and consequently its processes became more circular. That is, the machinic components invented more co-dependant ways of interacting, and a ‘recurrent causality’ evolved that is characteristic of concretization. This individuation was shared between components, drawing them into concrete machinic process through the evolution of a shared associated milieu.
