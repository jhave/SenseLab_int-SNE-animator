As Andreas Brockman writes, the work initiated a dynamic ‘social inter-facing’, constructing a ‘fragmented and heterogeneous system of engaging different publics in a variety of specific ways’. Here Lozano-Hemmer, as he often has, employed the bodies of the participants as disruptive ‘performed’ interfacings within a machine composed otherwise of technical objects. This melding of technical objects with the unpredictable input of a public presents one possibility of providing the technical elements with an expanded potentiality, with the interfacing body play the role of ‘transducer between machines’. Here the connection between biological and technical objects was a tactic to generate difference, not collapse it, to produce ruptures or gaps in the process of ‘dephasing’, (in which a stable identity is delineated from ongoing processes of becoming).
