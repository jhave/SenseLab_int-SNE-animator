There is indeed much to be critical of in the privileging of the interface. As Massumi notes, it can promote a naïve excitement in ‘the joy of connection’ and undifferentiated flows of information, an unquestioning, utopian promotion of ‘interface, for interfaces’ sake’, that fits in perfectly with Capitalist models of circulation and surplus-value. To this one might add the cybernetic conflation of biological and technical of which Simondon is so dismissive, which Massumi describes as the ‘industry philosophy’. This extension of the ‘prosthetic function’ of the interface, is utilized as a method of controlling, ‘a relay point in the dissemination of human ordering activity into space…transform[ing it] into a realm of expansion onto which the human projects itself’, with real difference erased as the body ‘disappears behind a techno-logical shield’. This subjectification of the technical object, Munster has pointedly termed ‘interfaciality’, a codification as face to face, rather than body to machine relation.
