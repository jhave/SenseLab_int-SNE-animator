An art-event might be such a machine: regulating and producing affectual flows, a ‘machinic of expression rather than a signifying apparatus’ , a producer of movement or difference . This, I want to demonstrate, positions interfacing as a prime creative force-form, for, as Deleuze states, ‘difference, potential difference and difference in intensity [is] the reason behind qualitative diversity’. Seeing interfacing as a machinic action implies a shift in designing art events to emphasis their machinic potential: their productive capacity or capability to produce difference, rather than for their aesthetic qualities. It is this operation of the interface as a differential machine that the rest of this paper addresses through an unpacking of Re:Positioning Fear: Relational Architecture 3.
