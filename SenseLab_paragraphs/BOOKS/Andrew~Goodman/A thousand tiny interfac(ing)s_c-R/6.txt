Philosopher Brian Massumi has argued that the interface is an unsustainable concept within a process-centered world. As a ‘privileged site of mediation’ within a system, he argues, the idea of the interface as a prime site of creativity and interaction denies what in process philosophy might be seen as the relational nature of all entities. Massumi’s philosophical stance emphasizes the ‘primacy of processes of becoming over the states of being through which they pass’, that is, the fact that any entities that are interfacing with each other are themselves composed of relations. As such, discrete interfaces are problematic in that they might be seen to imply a world inhabited by ideal, internally stable objects, between which interactions occur. The interface’s role, in such modes of thinking, is to rejoin entities that are by implication discrete, and the complexity of continued unfolding and relation to the dynamic virtual or potential is then greatly diminished.
