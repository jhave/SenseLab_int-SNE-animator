If parasitic action was in a sense a continual performed splitting of relation, the interfacing that occurred in Re:Positioning Fear might also perhaps be thought as producing difference through connecting, through incitation or a ‘dynamics of infection’ that worked to prolong and complexify. That is, through a folding of technological objects and bodies in interfacing something new was produced (art). As Murphie writes, this is a doubling that technologies can perform, in this case the body becoming-with the lights, the façade becoming-with shadows, portraits becoming-with movement and so on. This folding, rather than collapsing difference to produce a new homogenous history or façade, produced through multiplication new singularities that were performed alongside, throughout and in the gaps of the previously existing iterations. Folding could be seen here to be powerful in both the creation of actualized and potential foldings that the interfacing opened up; a bifurcating of future unfoldings that resonated within the event.
