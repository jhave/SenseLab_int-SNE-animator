Parasitic machinics produced not a linear evolution of the work, but rather enabled ‘processes of connectivity and interpenetration...[and] the fostering of specifically transversal connections’ [34]. This parasitic action of interfacing was an agent of difference in that it continued to re-express (transduce) relation. It kept the event always on the point of splitting and moving into multiple new forms, suspending it in unfolding differentiation. Again, this is not unusual within works such as this designed to accommodate interference. Perhaps what is notable here is the degree to which such disruptions overtook the original structures.
