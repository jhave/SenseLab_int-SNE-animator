Interfacing here was a performative act by which the machine continued to re-fold its internal systems. It was also a machinic action folding elements outside itself into its workings, and these actions created, as Deleuze says, a ‘forced movement’ or ‘internal resonance’ within the system. Thus it was a tactic that re-immersed or re-saturated the event with the virtual as it implicated machinic components in each other’s becoming through an ongoing process of variation and re-articulation.
