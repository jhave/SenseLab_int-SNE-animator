Here Space-shifter makes explicit the vibrational forces surrounding and interpenetrating the body, the body’s ability as a conductive surface to transduce vibration and the diffractional resonances with and resistances to the power of the external vibrational rhythms that are folded into the body’s own rhythms and speeds to create a third shared potential, a parasitic body disrupting prescribed boundaries.
