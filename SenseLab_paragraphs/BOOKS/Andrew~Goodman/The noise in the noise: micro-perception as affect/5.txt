And yet… This is a plant – it has no ears, no brain. How is it that it listens, with what does it hear, how does it pay attention? And, one must ponder, how is it that it knows what it hears when it has no brain to perceive with? Perhaps, just as the brittlestar has no eyes yet is all eyes, it is all ears – literally – its whole surface attuned to the potential of a frequency, sensitive to the particular oscillations of one vibrational speed for which it has an appetite.
