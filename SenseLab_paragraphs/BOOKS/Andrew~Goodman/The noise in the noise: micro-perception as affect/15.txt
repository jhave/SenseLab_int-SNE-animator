Entering the environment of Space-Shifter one is bombarded by strange voices - part language, part guttural exclamation â€“ that saturate and resonate every surface, as much unsound as sound in their violent a-rhythmic shaking of the entire space. Floor, walls, air, speakers, sheets of metal and bodies are invaded, vibrated, penetrated and turned outward, made into surface. Metal buzzes with secondary resonances, feet become ears as they oscillate with the floor, waves of vibrations bounce of windows, walls and flesh taking on new and singular speeds through their interactions with the differing viscosities of surfaces. Each surface (re)performs (expresses) these vibrations in its own way, transducing according to its own affordances. Thus a speculative vibration launched into the space by the speakers proposes to these various surfaces a multiplicity of responses, combining their various and singular capacities to resonate into a machine that produces vibrational difference.
