Micro-perception places an essential rupture (parasite) within representational processes, a gap, within which the participants ‘perform’ some new version of themselves as part of the artwork/event. Shape-shifter tentatively both bridges the gap between ‘sound’ and ‘unsound’ as it makes evident their interconnectedness, and extends awareness of the unresolvable nature of this gap into clear perception, so that one is suspended within this process of perception-from-the-field. This, I would suggest, is ethical in that it works to increase various bodies’ abilities to affect and be affected, to engage and make relation with, to propose new potential for interaction.
