But as vibration is always as an event of difference, disrupting any continuum that it converts instead to a rhythm of contrasts, so in its actualization as waves in space it must also always operate diffractively. Diffraction is the way waves combine when they overlap and the apparent bending and spreading of waves that occurs when waves encounter an obstruction. As waves, sound then ‘intra-acts’ in this manner, individual wave patterns engaging in disruption and interference with one another, entangling in complex ecologies, always immanently expressing their differences. For example, as a sound wave generated by speakers in Space-Shifter hits and reflects off a surface (returning as a repetition but of a different speed) it will diffract with the incoming wave, producing new modulations that then also interfere and combine with both incoming and reflected waves, producing further modulations and so on – each is implicated in the individuation of all the others. Such noisily productive enfolding, disruption, complication and interference can be encapsulated in Michel Serres’ concept of the parasite – the noise in relation that is its creative force, a third, mobile position that complexifies, blurs distinctions between cause and effect and destabilizes exchange.
