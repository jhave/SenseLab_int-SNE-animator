The dance of the pitcher plant and wasp hints at the micro-perceptive potential enriching heard sounds – the transversal agency of sound-as-vibrational force coursing through ecologies as the vibrational diffraction of enmeshed relational difference. At this affective level, interactions – immanent relations – with sounds are not limited to the ear and the brain but stretch across the entire surfaces of bodies attuned to the sensations of their particular ecologies, a ‘listening’ independent of cognitive capacities and body boundaries. Sound, this strange pitcher-wasp symbiotic relation seems to indicate, contains, or is contained within, sonic excess: a silent, contagious life as force and as potential force, enveloping all in the ecology of the unheard.
