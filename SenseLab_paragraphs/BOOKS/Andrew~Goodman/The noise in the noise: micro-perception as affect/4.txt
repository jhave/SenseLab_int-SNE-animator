The pitcher plant and the wasp have come to an arrangement: when the wasp enters the plant’s flower and buzzes at a specific pitch the stamen release their pollen in an emphatic burst of rhythmic (vibrational) sympathy. No other pitch will do, the flower is indifferent to all other notes. It waits; it listens, attentively, for the wasp’s particular calling card.
