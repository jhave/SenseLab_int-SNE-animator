Micro-perception, can be understood as not being merely smaller or unrecognized perceptions – though the physical presence of the unheard begins to indicate some of the potential of micro-perception in relation to sound – but rather, as Massumi asserts, as ‘perception of a qualitatively different kind’. It is, as he explains, pitched at the level of affect, ‘hitting’ the body, not with a perceivable content but as a noise or interruption, thus it is a ‘purely affective re-beginning of the world’. Affect is here a primary creative force, that is, Fristch argues, it is the ‘dynamic unity’ of an event as it is also its extension or excess: ‘pre-personal, pre-individual and non-concious but real in so far as it offers potential for action’. As such, he argues, affect questions easy distinctions between event, subject and field. It remains in excess of its effects, retaining the capacity to effect.
