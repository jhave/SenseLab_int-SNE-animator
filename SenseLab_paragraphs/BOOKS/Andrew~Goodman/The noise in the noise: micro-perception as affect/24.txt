Space-shifter proposes all as ears/transducers – vibrational ecologies nested within ecologies. This is a doubling of the surface into a field-body machine, an in-between alive with productive potential – a ‘sound envelop’ (Didier Anzieu, The Skin Ego) that is as much a sieve as container, a topological space/brain, a ‘sensate surface’ of connection. The force of this sensorial meeting of surfaces is a vibrational interaction that leads us out of ourselves, as Lingis says, and into an experience with the world.
