How is it then that from this ‘noise’ of micro-perceptions diffracting and multiplying we can perceive sound and construct a useable set of vibrations? Clear perceptions, Deleuze argues, are actualized out of the potential of the micro-perceptions that form their virtual – the multiplicity from which they concresce: each is a singular configuration of ‘compossible minute perceptions’ that yields a perception as a ‘zone of clear expression’. These micro-relational vibrations form an affective entanglement, without necessarily being distinctly expressed in and of themselves. It is the act of perception – of productive resonance with vibration - that cuts into this virtual plane, actualizes a particular expression of the relations between micro-perceptions. That is, the perception expresses some diffractive combination (a relation between, expressed as a movement) of micro-perceptions in a particular way that yields a focus, but retains also some relation to all the micro-perceptions of the multiplicity. In each perception the multiplicity is alive in a process of ever-diffracting evolution in each heard or felt sound – a future-feeling driving further individuation.
