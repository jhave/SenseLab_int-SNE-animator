The heard and unheard components of the sounds affectively engage the body with vibration in ways that create new contingent bodies of components of the body-artwork assemblage (machines within machines). The vibrational excess of sensation experienced by the skin-as-ear drum over what sound is perceived by the ear itself envelops the body - creates feedback loops of skin and world - which create a shared vibrational zone, an intra-active ecology of diffractions. Surfaces are implicated in each other’s becoming(s): speaker surfaces affecting and affected by the vibrational capacities of the metal plates, floorboard oscillations meeting and conversing with vibrations of shoes, skin and walls bifurcating each other’s projected vibrations in the shared space in-between, bodies remade as speakers, receivers, reflectors: resonating surfaces.
