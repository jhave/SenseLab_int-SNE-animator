But the human body is receptive to a much wider spectrum - outside of this heard frequency range lies, as Steve Goodman evocatively terms it, ‘unsound’: the infrasonic and ultrasonic. To this list of the imperceptible we might add, as Roads does, the subsonic – sounds too soft to be perceptibly heard – and ultra-loud sounds – those that are ‘felt by the exposed tissues of the body as a powerful pressure wave’ more than they are recognized or processed through the ears. Such vibrations affect the body at a base level of force that disrupts and stimulates multiple sensory capacities: the pain of high volume shock waves forcibly vibrating flesh, the infrasonic beat of a sub-woofer reaching you through the soles of the feet, the prickling sensation on the skin of high frequencies, the physiological effects of these frequencies on in stimulating neural activity. To this we might add the emotional effects of such unsound: the anxiety or edginess that might be evoked by either the very high or loud, the coercive effects of deep beats, the lure of the just-too-quiet to be heard. As affects these unsounds are known to us through their formative effects on our emergent bodies.
