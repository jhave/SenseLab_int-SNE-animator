As such the parasitic actions of wave diffraction more than multiply the vibrations to be experienced through diffraction, they are a micro-perceptive machines that produce a multiplicity – a virtuality - to the sound event, a system of potential disruptive production of ‘new rhythms, resonances, textures and syntheses’ that is immanently produced with the audible: an excess that is potential of its machinic play.
