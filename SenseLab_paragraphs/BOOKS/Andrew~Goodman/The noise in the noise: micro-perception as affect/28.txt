Micro-perceptive sounds are parasites on cognition, on the hegemony of perceptive reduction of sensation of vibration, and on the easy distinction between listener and the listened-to (receiver and received). It requires of a body that it compose organs to cut or actualization perception from a virtual plane of vibration, but it also keeps it on the edge of the virtual, still at its most open to different combinatory possibilities, suspended in the not-quite decided. This is the parasite as creator of ‘fuzzy’ relation.
