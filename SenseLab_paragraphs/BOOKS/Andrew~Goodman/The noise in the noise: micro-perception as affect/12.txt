At the same time as it is a pre-bodily force of the world, it must be recognized also that micro-perception is always implicated in the bodily, in that it acts on and through a body, shifting it through the creation of a felt difference pre and post micro-perceptive event – an affective attunement - affects that can be known as such only through their effects on bodies. Such bodies – be they speakers, walls, pitcher plants or ‘organisms that person’, have an affective ‘appetite’: that is, a potential to affect and be affected. Each, in its own way, performs a particular way of ‘knowing’ the world – a specific engagement with certain vibrational frequencies: the human ear to vibrations roughly between 20Hz and 20 KHz.
