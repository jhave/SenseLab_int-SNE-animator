Micro-perceptive sound then might be seen to offer potential as one such transductive force, disrupting boundaries as it drives creativity through differential resonance/connection. Understanding the act of hearing as one of transduction potentially alters our whole conception of the act. We do not even, one might argue, ‘hear’ the sound per se – rather, the sound waves activate a sympathetic resonance in the mechanisms of the ear, which in turn are transduced into electronic pulses in the nerves and then to neural firings in the brain. This suggests that the act of hearing is intensive – the sound in the environment is a prehension in WH’s terms, but the actual hearing-event is self-contained, self-actualized in a separate event that is internally driven and satisfied. In this sense sound does not pass into the body as such, but there occurs sympathetic resonance and dissonance between the two systems.
