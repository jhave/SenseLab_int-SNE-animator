In Shape-shifter it is the foregrounding of the disruption of vibrational wave by vibrational wave, and the resonance of differing speeds of the bodies intensified as conjunctive surfaces, that gives this richness of the virtual from which the participant struggles to perceive (a process not only foregrounded but stretched or preserved). It is the vibrational ‘aliveness’ of the event that the body of the participant comes to feel itself explicitly implicated in.
