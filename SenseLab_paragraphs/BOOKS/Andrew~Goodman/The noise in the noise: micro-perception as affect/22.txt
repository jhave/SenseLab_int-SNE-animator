Due to diffraction we can say that a vibration in Space-Shifter always also produces parasitic vibrational forces immanent with its actualization, and doubles by producing also parasitic disruption on all other vibrations. Space-Shifter proposes to construct vibration-surface assemblages that form parasitic machines operating on multiple fronts: producing difference within waves through diffraction as a multiplication, a driving towards novelty of the event. I want to propose that the experience of Space-shifter employs the parasitic potential of micro-perception as creative force.
