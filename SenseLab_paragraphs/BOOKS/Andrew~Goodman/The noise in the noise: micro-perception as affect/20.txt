To begin this, we need to first understand something of vibrational diffraction and its role in producing difference through parasitic disruption. Sound as micro-perception is sound understood in its larger iteration as vibrational force, a ‘variation in pressure over time’ encompassing all the perceived elements of a sound that will be contracted - tone, pitch, rhythm, volume – and the unsound, the micro-perceptible remainder. The basis of all these components of sounds is as vibrational difference - questions of speed and interval of oscillation, and their modulating difference.
