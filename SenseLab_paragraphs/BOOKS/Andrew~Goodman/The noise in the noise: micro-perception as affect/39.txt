A ‘nomadic’ music suggests shifting ideas of sound design from completed or wholly realized sounds to mobile assemblages of micro-sounds as micro-perceptions, enabling a shift from a representational model to one of production. That is, to a sound perceived that is actively produced though combinations of micro sounds and the parasitic actions of diffractive resonances of their differences in machinic operation with both the means of broadcast and reception, which are in themselves conflated.
