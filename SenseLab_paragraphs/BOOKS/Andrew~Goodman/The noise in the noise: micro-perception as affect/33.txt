The dynamic (unheard) virtual of the perceived sound actively disrupts its stable status as ‘object’ as it becomes instead the product of differential relations of affects expressed in conscious perception. There is always a ‘more than’ that is a forward movement drawing the sound towards further perceptive concrescence. Shape-shifter draws these unheard relations into a clearer zone of expression (as it positions also what would habitually be clear into a zone of indeterminacy). This acts not to provide a more stable picture, but rather the opposite, it makes evident the dynamic complexity of vibrational forces present and makes felt something of their relation to the perceived sound in a way that disrupts clear, distanced or stable readings, as it invites us to suspend ourselves in this individuating process. One is thrust into (or emerges tentatively out of) a seething ecology of sensations  – the body drawing vibratory sensation from its various surfaces-as-organs to construct a perception. In this respect the work might be seen to be ‘ethical’ in that it cultivates sensitivity to a wider range of forces instigating sound events, encourages awareness of a ‘vitality’ of nonhuman composition and the ability ‘to become perceptually open to it’. ‘Perception’ of sound is revealed as contingent, in process, and sounds draw the participant into implication in the processes of diffraction and production.
