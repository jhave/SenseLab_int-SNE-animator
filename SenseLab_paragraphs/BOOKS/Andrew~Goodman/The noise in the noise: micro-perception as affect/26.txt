Both audible and inaudible elements of a sound also set up diffractive patterns with each other, a ‘hypersonic effect’. This parasitic noise operating on the audible range produces timbres, just as they must act to parasite unheard vibrational modulation. This production is not only tonal colour, but also rhythmically this multiplication produces a syncopation – surfaces acting as attractors in the system of modulation of beats  - an affective ‘rhythm machine’ organizing relations between pulsating bodies. Rhythm here is playing out the problem of the disjunction of differing vibrational speeds, a gathering of these differences on a plane.
