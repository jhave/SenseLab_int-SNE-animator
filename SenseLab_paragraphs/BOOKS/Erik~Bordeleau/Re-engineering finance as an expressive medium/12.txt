Currently, every process of value creation is forced to plug into an exploitative monoeconomy, a core system that flattens out all other forms of value. Like monoculture relies on one crop, monoeconomy relies on one form of value. The resulting financialization of the social has fostered spiraling indebtedness, the decreasing price of labor, and erosion of the welfare state. Yet, from households to cities, from software to trade, the work and very being of people are what backs the underlying value of finance. This unrecognized backing means we are tethered to the current instruments of finance as the sole abstract means by which we access new value. These financial forms depend on us for their vitality, and yet we depend on them as well, having no other means of accessing and sharing value without them.
