We want to change this state of affairs by promoting relations of equity between the different economic spaces. By doing so, we conceive of the economic spaces built on top of the platform as partners, rather than subjecting them to the extractive relations that characterize the contemporary financial paradigm. Equity acts as the horizontalizing force through which all econauts have access to, share in, and harvest this derivative value made available through the interoperability of heterogeneous abstract metrics. By offering the possibility to participate (i.e. have actual stakes) in occasions for financialization through equity relations, the platform enables the collective steering of financial dynamics and mechanisms for the purpose of collective redistribution and overspilling of values. It does so by concretely giving econauts the ability to issue their own tokens (and other kind of instruments) — that is, providing the capacity to index those values they want to share and sustain according to metrics they determine. This unprecedented move furnishes liquidity to the social and relational insensible production of value, and allows for the circulation/distribution of that liquidity in an ecosystem that collectively acknowledges those values — for the collective livelihood of that ecosystem.
