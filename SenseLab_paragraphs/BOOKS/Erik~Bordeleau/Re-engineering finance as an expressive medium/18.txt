Bitcoin introduced blockchain technology and cryptocurrency to the world, creating a decentralized network of trust, optimized for resiliency, verifiability and anonymity. Ethereum then built upon the consensus-based decentralized architecture of Bitcoin, adding a Turing complete scripting language with which to build applications. P2P crypto-currencies, smart contracts and second-generation blockchain tokens are introducing new ways of coordinating vast networks, as well as new ownership models based on mutual stakeholding in the protocol layer.
