Every digital platform, from goliaths like Facebook to the fringest of forums, creates a space of encounter and gathering, generating values of different types. We use the term economic space to designate the material and immaterial system of coordinates and attractors that gives shape to how people create and interact with resources, assets, values and their different modes of expression and representation. We conceive of these economic spaces as non-Euclidean. The term may sound strange or even extravagant, but non-Euclidean economic space has a specific meaning.
