Following a crucial insight developed by Randy Martin and further extended by the Volatility Reading Group, we think of financial derivatives as a technology to amplify the power of autonomous organisations, once it is used in the context of self-created economic space and made accessible through easy UIs and ready-made templates. These financial instruments organise — weave together, distribute, branch — economic flows, and thereby create new modes of relation, modes which were previously unavailable, impossible, or even nonexistent. By operating the instruments of synthetic finance, one gets to arrange the attractors of one’s own behavior, to shape the rhythms and patterns of the economic spacetime where behaviour itself expresses. With the Space platform, it becomes possible to express “the way we are social with each other”, the mutual indebtedness and collective stakeholding that compose our common wealth.
