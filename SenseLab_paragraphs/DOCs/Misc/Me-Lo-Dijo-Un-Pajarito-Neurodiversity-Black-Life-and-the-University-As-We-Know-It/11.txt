What has shifted in the university as regards neurodiversity is the steady entry into the bounds of its edifice not only of neurodiverse bodies, but of accounts of what neurodiversity brings. Those bodies that “pass” have been there all along, “functioning” at the limits of what constitutes the docile body they, we, have been taught to mimic. The other bodies, the ones classically excluded remain excluded for the most part, but there are exceptions, and these more visible exceptions are troubling what it means to be included in the edifice of learning. They are making themselves heard, teaching us how to bring facilitation into the classroom, reminding us of how inaccessible most of our practices of teaching are, how unaccommodated the non-docile body remains despite the many academic discourses that circulate supporting its presence. It is not the numbers of the visibly neurodiverse in the academy that is making the difference I am noting – I  have never had a classical autistic actually enrolled in one of my classes (though many have attended on Skype, unaccredited), but the growing realization that they are there, that they require accommodations most classrooms cannot provide, that together it is urgent that we imagine – tent on the edges of the room to facilitate non-frontal modes of attention –  what else teaching and learning could be. These experiments in sitting together differently, our faces not the center of attention, our words typed and not spoken, and hands stimming, our bodies jumping, have affected my sense of what what the learning body can look and sound like (including my own) and it is this learning, allied to language's otherwise rhythms, to the stims and tics and poetic utterances that come of engaging asymetrically with language’s modalities of communication, that move me to write with and against the university as we know it.
