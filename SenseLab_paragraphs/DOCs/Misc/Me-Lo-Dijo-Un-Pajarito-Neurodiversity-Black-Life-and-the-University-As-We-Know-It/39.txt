The outside is an inutitive concept for the more neurodiverse amongst us. It is what accompanies all experience in the making. What leaves those traces that still vibrate on the edges of what we call objects. It is the edgings into experience, the colourings of time, the echoes of futures on the cusp that interrupt that chunking neurotypicals continuously seek in their search for categories. It is the world that isn’t yet quite there before the chunk, the world that that accompanies without quite situating itself, a kind of continous refrain that orients the not-quite of all form-takings. It is the intensities that sound that so many don’t seem to hear, those intensities that are continuously getting in the way of the human voice, that privileged site of human expression, the intensities that whisper to us that the world is lively and living beyond the space the human takes. The outside is not where our teachings have focused, though those of us who teach art have an affinity for it. We may speak in terms of hunches, of feeling, of affect, of tendency, of force – all of these synonyms for that which participates but cannot be circumscribed. This is not the knowledge we’ve been taught to recognize, not the knowledge of forms already captured. The outside is not the formed matter, the segmented, the archivable. It is the anarchic share of striated knowledge, the share of experience which resists scripting yet nonetheless affects what the script can do. Anarchival knowledge, neurodiverse knowledge, is not outside form so much as in the cleaving between form and force. It is what calls knowledge back to its edgings-into-experience. It is the diagram, the force of form, of knowledge where knowing meets unknowing.
