The invention of socialities is a study in living, a living study. It speaks often in pronouns intermixed – it is not unusual to hear autistics speak of themselves in the third person. A cold coming on, Adam Wolfond writes: "I think my body jumps because I am feeling sick. I think I have a cold in my boy nose. I am really wanting razor sharp always feeling body to be very calm and I want the body to wash away like the water you use. I want the water to always give me answers about how to stay quiet in my body. My body is always trying to stay calm. Talking as you do is away from the way my not very calm hated body talks. Hated is calming way of Adam and always questioning and asking people." At once I and Adam and boy, Adam and the cold co-compose, water the teacher that may give the directions to ordering the body within neurotypical parameters. Because having, being a moving autistic body is dangerous in a neurotypical world. Not only will it get you sidelined (as unintelligent, as deviant) – if you happen to be autistic and black, it may also get you killed.
