Bodyings are always new, but they donâ€™t create new kinds of human. They decimate the human as we know it, undoing it of its sovereignty, of its (white) neurotypical body. Bodyings are the socialities through which we, those who benefit from the whiteness that turns bodies into human givens, should always have known ourselves, not as the center of the universe, not as the perspective from which everything is oriented, but as a certain quality of the more-than, always radically singular in a way that exceeds the form a single body can take. Bodyings are collective before being individual, social even when solitary. The human never works alone, and never is without an ecology of practices that far exceed the bounds of our skins.
