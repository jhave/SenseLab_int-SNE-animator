Power works from the outside, but never from the outside-in: “It is always from the outside that a force confers on others or receives from others the variable affection that exists only at a given distance, or in a particular relation” (1988: 86, translation modified). An outside without inside is a force without a form. Form is a constellation of effects that body, here, now, in just this way. While there is no question that power also contributes to how a form-taking occurs, Foucault’s insistence on the importance of the outside is a reminder that power always also carries an excess, a more-than that is not captured by the form itself. “There is therefore a becoming of forces which remains distinct from the history of forms, since it operates in another dimension” (1988: 86, my translation). Bodying is an example of this: a body is a coming-into-itself that orients the effects of power toward a certain taking-form. What makes it a bodying is that this taking-form composes with registers that are rife with other potential orientations. Bodyings are not simply form-takings, they are the activation of the force-of-form toward emergent shapings. These emergent shapings have histories and geneologies and futurities. How they come to be what they are, here, now, matters. But this “just now” is always also more-than the shape it has momentarily taken. Consent not to be a single being: move the relation.
