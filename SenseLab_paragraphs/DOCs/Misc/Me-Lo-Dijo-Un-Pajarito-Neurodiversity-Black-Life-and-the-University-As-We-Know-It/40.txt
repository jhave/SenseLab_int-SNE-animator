When knowledge begins to escape stratification, when its form begins to blur, its anarchic share surfacing, its alignment to power also shifts. Power and knowledge begin to compose differently. It’s not that knowledge is no longer irreducible to power (Foucault’s point, after all, is that this irreducibility is what gives the potential for resistance), it’s that the irreducibilility begins to scintillate in ways that give knowledge the breadth, the force, to subvert the striations that usually constrain it.
