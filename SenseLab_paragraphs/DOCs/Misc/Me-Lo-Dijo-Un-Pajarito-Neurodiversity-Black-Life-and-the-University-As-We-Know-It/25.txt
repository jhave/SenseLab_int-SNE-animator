There is a certain resonance here with accounts from Black Studies coming from scholars such as Fred Moten, Stefano Harney, Sylvia Wynter, Frank Wilderson, Alexander Weheliye, Jasbir Puar, Ashun Crawley and others around the concept of black life. Frank Wilderson writes: “Though it might seem paradoxical, the bridge between blackness and antiblackness is  ‘the unbridgeable gap between Black being and Human life’” (Wilderson 2010: 57 in Moten 2013: 749). Blackness, Moten writes, “must free itself from ontological expectation, must refuse subjection to ontology’s sanction against the very idea of black subjectivity” (2013: 749). This is not to say that black bodies are not sites of power’s contestation, but to emphasize that the “paraontological distinction between blackness and blacks allows us no longer to be enthralled by the notion that blackness is a property that belongs to blacks (thereby placing certain formulations regarding non/relationality and non/communicability on a different footing and under a certain pressure) but also because ultimately it allows us to detach blackness from the question of (the meaning of) being” (Moten 2013: 749-750).
