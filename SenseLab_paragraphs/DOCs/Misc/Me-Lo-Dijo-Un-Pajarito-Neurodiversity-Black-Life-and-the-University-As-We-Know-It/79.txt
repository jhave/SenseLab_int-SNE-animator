I want to attune to the thing that the university gives away, or rather, that already gives itself away through the university’s vestibule. I mean to engage with the outpouring of what is held, to think in the midst of what it means to be held by the university, in the hold of and as the university, even when such meaning as explanation is necessarily inadequate to account for the unaccountable cut, the inexplicable dissensus that tears Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s Tropical Malady apart, while also holding together, in fugitive, while also holding together, in fugitive, diasporic consent, the flights enacted by those who refuse to be a single being. In my encounter with the hieroglyphics, oral and phantom vibrations of this otherwise university, what I find are traces of an irreducible homelessness (which is to say the force and problem of blackness, and its question(ing)) common to the enclosed, the disciplined, the unloved (those of us who have been said to be no-body, to have and to be no-thing, to be impoverished, to be poor in the world)” (Rose-Antoinette).
