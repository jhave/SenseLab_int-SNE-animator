The diagrams for life-living activated by the emergent socialities of neurodiverse life are never perspectival. The diagrams are always askew, asymmetrical, unbound by forms that would constrain them. They are wild, anarchival, messy. These diagrams, fashioned of knowledge always still in the making invite us, incite us to connect to how else we can unknow, unown the language of the order-word as it has been passed down, neurotypical generation after neurotypical generation. 
 
Fred Moten asks: “Is there knowledge in the service of not knowing, of study as unowning knowledge?” (2013: 242). The unknowing, the unowning of knowledge takes courage. An abyss awaits where passages have not yet been invented.
