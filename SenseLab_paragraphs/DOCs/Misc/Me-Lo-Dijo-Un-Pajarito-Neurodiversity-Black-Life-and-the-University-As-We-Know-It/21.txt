To work with the circulation of power, it is necessary to move beyond body to bodying, beyond the notion that there are pre-existing individuals that are powered by a hierarchy that measures their movements. The university is not a field that operates through such cut and dry hierarchies. The university is a diagram of power through which “we” are created and recreated as power/knowledge bodyings. “We” are the university, emboldened to become-bodies under circumstances we co-compose. Or, at the very minimum, we are a field of forces that makes it possible for those tendings-toward-bodies the university promotes to keep agglomerating. It is “we” who make its thinking possible, even if only by remaining in its midst. And it is “we” who pass or fail those for whom the qualities of bodying the university presupposes and creates are insufficient to survive, and to thrive in its framework.
