The asymmetries the university produces are reflected in the asymmetries of its "we," asymmetries of duration and scale. Placing the power (or repression) in the individual won't begin to address the complexity of the bodyings that chew at the joints of its foundations. To speak of us, the “we,” as one, as identifiable, as measurable, would be to underestimate the creativity of our movements. It would make us human, all too human, when in fact our bodyings are transversal, collective before they are individual, more-than. It would also underestimate the power of capital that runs through each artery of the institution, connecting to speeds and durations also always more-than human. Any “we” is always already composing at the interstices of these uneasy collaborations between different valences of the more-than.
