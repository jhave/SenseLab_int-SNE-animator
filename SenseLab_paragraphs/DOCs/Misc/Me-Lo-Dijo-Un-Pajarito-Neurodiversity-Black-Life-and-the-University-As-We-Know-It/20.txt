Power is never individual. The individual is, at the very most, the expression of its passage, not its operator. These teachings of Foucault's are often backgrounded in analyses of power that would still situate power within the bodies that wreak destruction or suffer its consequences. It is important, in thinking the systemic nature of power in the university to clarify how power operates, how it is at once ours and beyond a "we" that preexists, how power is a mode of circulation more than it is a targeting practice. Power is what moves through the diagrams that co-compose us. As Foucault writes, “the individual is not a pre-given entity which is seized on by the exercise of power. The individual, with his identity and characteristics, is the product of a relation of power exercised over bodies, multiplicities, movements, desires, forces” (1972: 73-74).
