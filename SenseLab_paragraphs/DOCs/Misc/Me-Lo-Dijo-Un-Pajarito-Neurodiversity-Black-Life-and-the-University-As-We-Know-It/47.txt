Emergent sociality edges into experience as the force which unmoors expectations about the relationscapes that compose us. It speaks from the corners, from the ledges and edges and thresholds of experience still taking form. It flyes off the bodying with sparks, it stims and tics and hollers. It melts down when the world is just too much to take, the tensions of the world speeding like lightning along the bodyâ€™s feeling-alwaysfeeling surfaces. The world is too much and yet it is lived, fully, again and again to a limit unconceivable for most neurotypically-inclined. Neurodiversity invents life. Life-living.
