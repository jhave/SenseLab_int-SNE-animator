Black life is that which must be constitutively abjected – and as such has represented the negative ontological ground for the Western order of things at least for the last five hundred years – but can never be included in the Western world order, especially the category of Man. Phrased differently, there can be no black life in the territory of Western, humanist Man, which is why the existence of black life disenchants Western humanism (2014b: 5). 
A similar account moves through the writings around neurodiversity: “Autistic bodies […] these are bodies that not only defy social order, but fail to acknowledge social order’s very existence. Autism, then, poses a kind of neuroqueer threat to normalcy, to society’s very essence” (Yergeau 2017: 36). A more-than defies the concept of the human in both cases, a more-than that deeply unsettles the human as he is defined by the (white) discourses of neurotypicality. The human as the omnipresent category that holds dominion over knowledge in every walk of life.
