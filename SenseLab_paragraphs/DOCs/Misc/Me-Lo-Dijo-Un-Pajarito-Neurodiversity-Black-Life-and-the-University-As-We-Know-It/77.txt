I want to engage with what it is to be broken, to be broke, to live in and as the break, the invaluable wealth that the university regards as inexpensive and unexpandable, the demonic grounds and lands against which it institutes itself, presuming that life and land can be individuated out of their flesh and made sense of. To be sure, the university’s (inter)disciplinary arsenal exists, and has always existed, in the service of repressing the incoherence, the excess it figures in this otherwise, unthinkable blackness. The university is meant to individuate you and I, us, as proper subjects in possession of their faculties” (Rose-Antoinette).
