In the manyness of language, order-words are the mechanism of orientation that keep language in check. For Deleuze and Guattari, the order-word is the “elementary unit of language” (1989: 76). “We call order-words, not a particular category of explicit statements (for example, in the imperative), but the relation of every word or every statement to implicit presuppositions, in other words, to speech acts that are, and can only be, accomplished in the statement” (1989: 79). Order-words keep the saying in check. And yet, textual disarray is continuously unmooring language, unfastening it of its order-words. The emergent sociality of textuality is just too complex. In an interview with Fred Moten, Stefano Harney writes: “The one thing that I was thinking about as you were talking about the text being a social space is it’s exciting for me when we get to that point where the text is open enough that instead of being studied, it actually becomes the occasion for study. […] I think that this notion also applies in the social space of the text itself, even where the study is not yet apparent” (109)
“There is no individual enunciation. There is not even a subject of enunciation” (Deleuze and Guattari 79).
