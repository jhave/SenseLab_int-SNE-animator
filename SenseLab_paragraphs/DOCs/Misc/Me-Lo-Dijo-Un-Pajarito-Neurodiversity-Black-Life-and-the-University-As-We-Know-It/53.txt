When allied to language, emergent socialities are collective assemblages of enunciation - agencements collectifs d’énonciation. The French is necessary here to mark the specificity of the concept of agencement, often lost in translation. Agencement is not a form in any sense of the word (neither is it an arrangement). Agencement assembles – it is the movement-toward, the orientation that creates the conditions for a process to “take.” Collective assemblages of enunciation are machines of language, mobilisors of potential that motor expression toward articulation. They remind us that the content of language can never be abstracted from its expression: “what comes first is not an insertion of variously individuated statements, or an interlocking of different subjects of enunciation, but a collective assemblage resulting in the determination of relative subjectification proceedings, or assignations of individuality and their shifting distributions within discourse” (1989: 80). Sociality before, and between, in the relation.
