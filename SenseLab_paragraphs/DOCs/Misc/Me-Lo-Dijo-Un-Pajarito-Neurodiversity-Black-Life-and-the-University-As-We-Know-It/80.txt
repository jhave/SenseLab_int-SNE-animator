I have never learned so much, never studied quite this way. I am a student. I study and this is my crime, that I hear in the words of the others who study the need to listen differently. I know some of us will get through. I am a professor, I made it through the gates, passed every single hurdle until I hit the highest ceiling. I thought it would protect us. I thought it would make it possible for me to squeeze you through the membrane. But they didn’t let you through. We didn’t let us through.
