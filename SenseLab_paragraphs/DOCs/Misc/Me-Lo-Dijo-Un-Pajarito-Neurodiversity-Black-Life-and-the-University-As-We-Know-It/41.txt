Perhaps, at the point of scintillation, knowledge is no longer the right term. Study is a better term. Or research-creation. These are thicker concepts, I think, for the texture of what I am trying to gesture towards, when I speak of knowledges unknowing. But for now, I want to hold on to the possibility that the term itself, that knowledge could still be carried forth as that which has the capacity for doing the work differently, if only to emphasize the trouble neurodiversity brings to the academic institution, trouble that most often erupts around the question of who knows how to know.
