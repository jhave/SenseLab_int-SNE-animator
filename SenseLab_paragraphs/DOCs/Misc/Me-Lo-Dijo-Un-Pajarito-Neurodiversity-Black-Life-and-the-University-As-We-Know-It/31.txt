Research-creation, as SenseLab has argued over more than a decade of practice, can be an alignment to the ways in which study itself is a practice. It can be a mode of inquiry that asks what (other) forms learning can take. It can refuse to privilege the materiality of language over other materialities while at the same recognizing thinking as a creative practice in its own right. When practiced this way, research-creation creates the conditions to ask how the theory-practice split continues to give knowledge-production a certain linguistic overtone, understanding practice more as that which needs to be studied than as study itself.
