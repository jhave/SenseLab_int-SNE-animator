Bodying need not include an alignment with humanism, with existing modes of defining what it means to be human. This is something I learn from autistics such as Tito Mukhopadhyay, Adam Wolfond, DJ Savarese, Amelia Baggs, Frank Bissonnette, Donna Williams, Lucy Blackman and so many others who remind us about the more-than that animates the field of experience that is life-living. Through their writing, each in their own way engages a reorienting of what matters in experience to include the constitutive field of the more-than in the edgings of the not-yet. Amelia Baggs’s In My Language (2007) perhaps still stands out as the most chilling account of how nonspeaking autistics are excluded from the realm of the human, their personhood extracted precisely because of the breadth of more-than human feeling their language, their living, includes. In her 8-minute video, in which the first four minutes are spent listening to and smelling and touching the objects around her, and the next 4 minutes are spent typing on a voice-activated computer, she says: 
It is only when I type something in your language that you refer to me as having communication. I smell things. I listen to things. I feel things. I taste things. I look at things. It is not enough to look and taste and smell and feel. I have to do those to the right things […] or else people doubt that I am a thinking being, and since their definition of thought defines their definition of personhood so ridiculously much they doubt that I am a real person as well. 
There are an infinity of gestures coming out of the neurodiversity community that repeat this experience that neurotypical folks have a much too limited idea of what constitutes experience, a perceptual dearth that doesn't allow for the vividness of the more-than of worlds in the making.
