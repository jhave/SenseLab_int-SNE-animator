Ido Kedar writes: “In ABA years I lost hope […] I felt I lost many years in this lonely endeavor. ‘Touch your nose.’ ‘Touch tree.’ ‘Touch your head.’ ‘Look at me.’ ‘Do this.’ ‘Sit quiet.’ ‘Touch red.’ ‘Good job.’ ‘Hands quiet.’ ‘No.’ ‘Great.’ ‘No.’ ‘All right.’ ‘No.’ […] My life is better now. […] I’m communicating with more and more people now. Though I still get sad, it’s true, I’m not hopeless. Now I’m living in a flascard-free world. I’m never touching my damn nose again” (2012: loc 1301).
