Sociality is perhaps the connection here, between black life and neurodiverse life, sociality as an emergent quality of bodying, as an emergent force for the more-than that is life-living. Speaking of entanglement and what Denise Ferreira da Silva calls “difference without separation” in the context of singer Bessie Smith, Fred Moten writes: “I think of Bessie as an effect of sociality – she was sent by sociality to sociality, in that way that then allows us to understand something about how the deep and fundamental entanglement that we are still exists in relation to and by way of and as a function of this intense, radical, constant differentiation.” Is sociality not the bodying, the quality of black life, the force of form that activates what Moten calls the “radicalization of singularity” of a difference without separation?
