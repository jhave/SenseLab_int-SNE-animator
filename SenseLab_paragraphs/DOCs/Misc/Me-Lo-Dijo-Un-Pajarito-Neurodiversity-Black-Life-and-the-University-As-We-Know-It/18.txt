Difference will always be accepted to a degree. As long as the norm is upheld it will always be good to have a few exceptions, especially when those who enter that space clearly mark themselves as different. But she is not one of those. She doesn’t want to speak in the name of her difference. She doesn’t want to teach you how to know her, how to write about her. She won’t speak for all indigenous people, for all black people, for all queer people, for all autistics. She won’t explain. She will resist citing you. She isn’t interested in "according to." She won’t be aligned, she won’t be colonized. Not because she is a rebel. But precisely because she operates in another mode, in the mode of the more-than which listens to undercommon ways of cawing. From the perspective of this more-than always yet to be composed, to be speciated, she won't presume the symmetry rebellion presupposes. She won't presume neurotypicality.
