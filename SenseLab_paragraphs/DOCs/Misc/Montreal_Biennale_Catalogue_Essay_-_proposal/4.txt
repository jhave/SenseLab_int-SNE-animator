The essay will revolve around the question of the futurity in the present. If it is possible to "look forward" toward the future, it can only be because there is something of the future in germ in the present. How can the future-present be conceived? Our first response is: as potential. But this does not so much answer the question, as generate new dimensions to the problem. How is potential "seen"? But of course, potential as such cannot be seen with the eyes. What kind of eyeless "vision" makes felt forces of futurity? What is the difference between experiencing a present potential and judging a future possibility? If there is a sense in which the present is pregnant with futurity, what does this say about our notions of the linearity of time? What other ways are there of thinking about the form of time? The very question implies a multiplicity of time-forms. This raises the question of art: can art not just reflect the times, but actually create time-forms? And can it not just take time, as a form of labor or of leisure consumption, but make time? If art can make time, in what way does it qualify as an experimental speculative practice? Our exploration of these issues will lead to a questioning of the meaning of the contemporary. What is it that is contemporary about "contemporary art"? What is the relation between the contemporary and the untimely (the nonlinearity of creative time-forms)? How do the categories of "art contemporain" and "art actuel" as they operate in the Quebec context relate to the issues raised? Finally, what does a creative politics of potential "look like"? In what way does art, as an art of time, connect to the political?
