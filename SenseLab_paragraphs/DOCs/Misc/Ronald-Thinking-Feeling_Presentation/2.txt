In the room where I am working now, writing, composing what is supposed to serve as a preliminary work for a philosophy of experience, I am suddenly forced to think and to feel the presence, oh so tiny, of a creature balancing, very precariously, on some filamentous structure. Giving the fact a closer look, the arachnid invites me to rethink the terms of co-habitation of the environment she and I are both sharing. I have become aware of its presence, either by reason of its corporeal displacement, or on account of its form that I have been accustomed to, and that I have usually been repulsed by. Be that as it may, actualizing in the corner of my eye the presence of such an individual by my sides, I cannot be but disturbed, newly aware of the fact of being perceived. The fact being that such a creature moving, living, vibrating in what I used to perceive as my own field constitutes a choc, however small, to my thought. The spider occupies the environment as much as my field of perception does; Iâ€™m having trouble to get over its proximity, of how close it is and we co-exist. I fail to substract the web from both my direct perception and the most vivid reminiscence of it. This is enough to disrupt the mode through which I was used to perceive my single presence, and now think the latter in coincidence or in occurrence with the non-human.
