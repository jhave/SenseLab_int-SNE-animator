Not all the surfacic elements existing within the perceptual field of the invertebrate are of equivalent use-value: the spider has a special concern for the folds, the holes, the discontinuous, the non-linear, providing it a set of affordances. A set of affordances is a derivative from the concept of niche which is nothing but the how, the style, the quality of the animal’s living. What color, what tonality, what affectivity the environment the spider and I co-compose will take depends on whether what each experiential conjecture perceives is attributed a negative value (an obstacle), or interpreted as a surface of propulsion and orientation. Whence, the following proposition I make: the space-office I organized and elevated to the level of my human subjectivity contains more or less obstacle tones for the animal I am living with.   
 
« We may say that the number of objects which an animal can distinguish in its own world equals the number of functions it can carry out. If, along with few functions, it possesses few functional images, its world, too, will consist of few objects.” (1957: 49)
