If we are to speculate somewhere, it is at the scale of the relations—not ours, but all relations, more than human, machinic—to think and to feel with. The question at stake is ethological as much as it is ecological. Perception isn’t the property of any particular subject. In virtue of its eventness, perception cannot be attributed to one form of life at the expense of another. Our proposition, under the imperative of an ontogenetic apprehension of reality, is to begin with what William James calls a “pure experience,” it is to follow the process of emergence of an event. How is the event of perception, in the making of itself, made felt? And how perception may in return grasp or prehend what is always in the making, in-the-forming of its-self? How may perception attune to the continuously processual and transformational? The question of the how of perception, the how of thought is a technical one. It is the question of what it is that constraint such or such faculty to push its own limits, to press toward the next, of what it is that forces to think-perceive—in sensation—more than what we actually select. What a perception can is not up to volition, to an intentional consciousness to decide.
