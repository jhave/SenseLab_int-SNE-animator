From the performative facets of what reverberates as an image spring, also by means of their interweaving, the animal milieu and the human milieu. A window is an opportunity for me to have a perspective on the freshly snow-covered street, but also maybe, in the meantime, an opportunity to enjoy the shimmering rays of the sun setting; for the arachnid, the opportunity to weave its cobweb, as both a trap and a network. The spider and I perceive these conjunctive surfaces, perceive these molecules, waves and vibrations insofar as we discriminate their affordances.
