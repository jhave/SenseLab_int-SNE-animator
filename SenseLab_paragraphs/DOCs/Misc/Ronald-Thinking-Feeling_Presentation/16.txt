Whatever the perspective adopted, the existence of the space (for me becoming a writing environment, this office-milieu) is not correlative to the multiperspectivism that runs through it. In fact, the environment from which I abstract a use-value I call office doesn’t have, from its own standpoint, a surface more useful than another—and it is a very common fallacy to reduce the environment to what it means to one’s subjective form of representation (as does phenomenology and its eidetic reductionnism to the human limit). We will content to say that the event does not self-constitute and “endures” its own problem neither for me, nor for anyone else, but rather for itself, compromising my very subjective aim.
