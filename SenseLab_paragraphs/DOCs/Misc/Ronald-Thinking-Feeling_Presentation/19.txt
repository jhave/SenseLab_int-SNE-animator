What does it mean to be a spider? How does it feel to be an orchid? Our aim, of course, is not to think or to perceive like these species subjectivities, to think or to feel like the perspectives we are more or less familiar to : the Being of the thing is the least interesting question we can start with. The conjunctive term AND is our substitute for the essential certitude IS. What is really crucial here, not only from a speculative but also a pragmatic standpoint, theoretical as much as practical, is not to make these strange, unfamiliar perspectives transparent and intelligible to ourselves, than to think and to feel with them. We shall succeed here not to understand, nor to comprehend the intensive relations, the alliances human and non-human environments inevitably co-create—if by understanding one seeks to accentuate the anthropological rupture, at the expense a coming-multitude, of a becoming-other—but to transversalize, to fluidify them more than ever. The move we operate here should not be confused with a behaviorist psychology. Rather, it is one that moves toward a compositionist politics. An impossible one, for it is always to come.
