The moreness, the surplus of the environment itself is of an immanent relational order. It does not exist in act, but in germ: its existence is not in the mode of a possible form, but of a formative force. What is latent in the environment-office is its capacity to be practiced and interpreted, its force of perception. It is not useful to one particular type of action and anticipation. It is a ready-to-become either this or that milieu, this or that point of view, this or that world. What the environment can do and afford is not limited to what “I” can do with it. Readers of Spinoza cannot but sanction this postulate. Although an affordance is relative to the dimension and the nature of the perceiver, we must resist the casual characterization of the force-field to perceive itself in terms of relativism. The force of perception of the office is not relative to my transcendental ego, it is not relative, in its own right, to any of the perceptions-actions considering and measuring it in accordance to their own needs and necessities. The environment-office—the appearance that I have generated—radiates beyond my own limit. I have failed to put it at the service of my own purposes. It has a vaporous, evasive sense of itself. It doesn’t stop at the scale of my personal actualizations, at my reasoned argumentation, with the invention of the cryptic Self. The style of existence of any situation, the mode of satisfaction of any-field-whatever is of not-only. That is why any lived occasion of experience is but left unsatisfied. The world is irreducible to its conditions of possibility. Its reality cannot be presumed. The world isn’t just waiting for you. The world immediately, empirically unjustified. Surviving the personal attributes, the emotional contents (my arachnophobia for instance), that may wire or connect with it.
