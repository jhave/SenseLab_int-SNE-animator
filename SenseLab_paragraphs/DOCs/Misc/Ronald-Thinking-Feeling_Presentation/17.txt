An event is not what it is because of other events, but because of the grasp it realizes of those other events, the way in which it "prehends" them, and the aspects under which it takes them into account as it produces itself. An event itself, as such, thus never has the power to define what its action will be, or its effect, or its influence on something else. The aspect of itself that will be taken into account, and thus contribute to the explanation of the account, did not, as such, preeexist this taking-into-account. Action, effect, influence: all these terms that seem to designate « external » relations, in which a transformation is explicable by something external, are relative to endurance. » (Stengers 2011: 186-187)
