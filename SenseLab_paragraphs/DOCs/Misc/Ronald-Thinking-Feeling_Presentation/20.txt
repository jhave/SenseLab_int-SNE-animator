A compositionist politics would rupture conceptions of movement as an a posteriori gesture, a compositionist politics would create time by generating the irreversible, the impossible. It is to emphasize that thinking, as much as perceiving, requires different techniques or modes of existence that are able to grasp or prehend what already saturates the field of attention. You are always in the midst of a complex, metastable ecology. No much space for solitude. A compositionist politics would inject not movement—for it would participate in it—but more potential into the field of experience; it would space as much as it would time perception, allowing for more, always more. That injection of potential would be the highest exercise of a speculating perception: un-limiting the joy, the hope, the pleasure, the affect that is nothing but a life (Deleuze). Again!
