Where I tend to neglect a (too) vertical surface, offering a very feeble degree of utility, the spider, on the other hand, perceives a surface of locomotion. The multiple corners of my apartment activate, from her to me, from percipere to percipere, a use-value which varies depending on whether it is a place to build its habitat and delineate its territory, for me a place where I can hide myself, where I can immobilize an object (as I fold matter to make myself a habitat, sheltering myself from extreme weather conditions and the views too intrusive). An angle thus formed is likely to be carrying multiple meanings, preexisting or prefiguring the actualisation of any existential kind. What is to be remembered is that, in itself, the fold of the wall is potentially more than its perception-action, in excess of a subjective calculation. Is it not also true that my body—even though it is a thought that worries me quite a bit—may at any time become its landing site, appearing as a useful surface where it can grow?
