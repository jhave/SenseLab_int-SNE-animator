But how does the spider represent the space to itself, the environment in which I appear among other things and beings? To what extent the perception of the spider I have in my back limits itself? Would it be possible that it perceives and activates the environment the way I do? How do I look, or how do I feel like from its perspective? And could it be possible that its field of action-perception gets thicker and thicker by reason of the same objects? There is much evidence to show that a certain image of my body, a certain sensation of my presence (vibrant), adds itself to its perception, contrary to mine. I cannot feel and think myself the way it does, given the fact that I sensuously appear as a constituent, an ingredient of what it prehends, somewhat, as an « array of adjoining surfaces » (Gibson 1950: 6). There’s no question that the animal makes of the surfaces composing our common environment a use different from mine. It is very likely that what strikes as an image from the point of view of the spider, appearing as a usable extension and maybe permitting a comfortable posture, is completely mute from my own perspective (I tend to discard it as an useless information). For her, the spider, neither the chair, nor the book, not even the screen of my computer entail the same interest. But, wait. What interest? For how could it be that what is significant for me, foregrounded by my perception-action, is also what is meaningful for her? How could a space organized, structured by the human principle to fit its needs and desires convey a similar meaning from the point of view of the non-human?
