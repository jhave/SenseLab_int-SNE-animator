Nonetheless, the office where I work is not the office of the spider, nor the office of the yellow orchid standing on the dresser in front of me, nor the office of the ants coalescing toward the piece of bread that fell on the floor during my breakfast. Each existential occasion activates and experiences the environment in its own way, in accordance with the perceptive organs that he, she or they have in their possession. Each occasion thinks and perceives the office in a different manner, with its own speed, each mobilizes its own procedures, but as far as it concerned, the office itself integrates or implicates all the perceptions-actions without any segregation: the existence of the environment-office is not relative to the type of perception actively justifying or tweaking it according to appetitions or necessities. Each existential being shall interpret the world differently in order to act and to think with.
