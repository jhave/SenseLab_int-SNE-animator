Where and when does an event really start? For example, does it begins when a donor for a fundraising arrive at the soirée or does it begin when he or she is affected and moved by the ambiance, the people supported? So then he or she can stepped by from the scripted event that’s supposed to be played. So then, the mediation can be dropped to embrace the immediation. In fact, there is not such more boring thing, night and moment when the script of an event is followed all time, letting nothing else happen than what’s already planned. No room for spontaneity, novelty, surprise, only uncommitted play for the encounter. This essay will discuss the conditions of emergence of the micro-events that compose the scripted event which in the end is a pretext or a lure for the « real » events to happen. Some techniques, worries, state of mind and constraints – not an exhaustive list because some might pop up during the event itself – will be presented and put in tension with what’s expected to let something else take place. The aim of this essay is to understand how the “real” start is crucial for the feeling of potentialities of the more-than event and its actual and virtual activations. In this process, some components of the immediations concept will be hopefully drawn.
