Description of the Activity:  The objective of this workshop was to provide the participants with an experimentation on relational touch and movement. I shared my work on embodying practices - the fundamentals of therapeutic massage and the awareness of movement.Â  The therapeutic massage and the awareness of movement are practices that aim to provide people (Senselab community and general public) with instruments for self-care and an approach to the experimentation of the singularity of movement within bodies.
