 Joana Chicau [PT] is a designer, with a background in performance - classical ballet and contemporary dance. In her practice she investigates the possible connections between – and coexistence of – choreography and media design, aiming to open the possibilities for new aesthetic, energetic and social dimensions in design production processes.  In her work she experiments with open source graphic tools, and the combination of programming and choreographic languages. The project has grown into diverse live performances and coding demonstrations of her methodology/ research and recently taken the format of ‘rehearsals’, a temporary stage for experimenting with coding and choreography.  website: https://jobcb.github.io/
