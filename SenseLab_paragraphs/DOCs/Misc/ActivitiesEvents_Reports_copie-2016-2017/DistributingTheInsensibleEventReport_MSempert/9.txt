Outcomes: 
	Five different book ‘forms’ emerged from the event, in-forming the generative, ineffable qualities of the anarchive: to always be in process, in motion, carrying the wonder for future possibilities. One of the five books that emerged from the event (“The Go-To, How-To Book of Anarchiving”) took on a ‘static’ form (i.e. published by The SenseLab through the Creative Commons).
	Noteworthy Individual Outcomes:
	> Three lyric essays (to be included in my PhD dissertation) composed from concept-germs that distribute the insensible sensibilities of the event; 
	> Fresh articulations potentiated into my acupuncture practice, esp around notions of affect, body, and an ethics of care. To be carried into workshops/seminars/talks with other acupuncturists who are also challenging Cartesianism and the tendency for Traditional Chinese Medicine to slip into reductionism and lose sight of the essence of its medicine: the body as anarchive.
