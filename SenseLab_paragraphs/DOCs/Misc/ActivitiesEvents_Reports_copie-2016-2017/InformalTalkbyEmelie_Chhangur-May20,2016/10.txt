Emelie Chhangur is an artist, curator, and award-winning writer based in Toronto. She is known for her process-based, participatory curatorial practice and the creation of long-term collaborative projects performatively staged within and outside the gallery context. Chhangur has developed an experimental approach to curatorial writing with an interest in how texts perform to create unique interpretative experiences. Over the past decade, she has been committed to finding inventive ways to enact activisms from within an institutional framework, questioning the nature and social function of the contemporary art gallery through embedded criticality and new methods of gallery "in-reach." She currently holds the position of Assistant Director/Curator at the Art Gallery of York University (AGYU), Toronto and is the founder of the AGYUâ€™s residency program. Chhangur makes single channel videos, installations, and performances that are shown nationally and internationally.
