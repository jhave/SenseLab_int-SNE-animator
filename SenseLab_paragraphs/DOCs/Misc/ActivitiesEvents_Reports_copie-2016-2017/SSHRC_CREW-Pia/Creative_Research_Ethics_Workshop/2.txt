The Creative Research Ethics Workshop (CREW)  was an ethics-in-action collaboration involving creative practice researchers from multiple universities in Melbourne, Australia.  Australian universities exercise regimes for the governance of ethical conduct in research that assume the capture and control of research activity into segments of pre-defined relationships. These regimes can act to diminish the potentiality of research-creation in the academy. This is not only problematic for research-creation, but also for research ethics-in-action more generally, which is always and only active in the event. The CREW set out to explore this problematic and unfurl alternatives via the practice of creating innovative “platforms for organizing and orienting live, collaborative encounters.” 
Starting in August 2016 with a two-day intensive workshop, the group explored ethics as a practice through readings, and encounters with specific creative practices. We developed a set of shared understandings about the intrinsic collectivity of ethics, the importance of slow negotiations of difference and situated particularities, the value of face-to-face dialogue as part of ethical deliberation, and how an ethical disposition might evolve through cultivations of enchantment.
This continued and expanded through weekly gatherings, leading to contributions to a conference concerned with the ethics and the arts (the iDARE conference) at the Victorian College for the Arts in late September. This contribution involved transforming an exhibiton space into an event platform for hosting workshop/performative events, and the production and dissemination of a conference bag/kit of ethical know-how ‘cultivators’.  
The group continues to assemble events that are concerned with these issues.
