Description of the Activity: The two day workshop was centred around an informal presentation by Sarah Cefai (The Feeling of a Place) and the activation of four propositional techniques for the mobilization of  new pedagogies. These techniques were concerned with: the immediation of more than human affect; post-human feminisms; writing and citation practices approaching writing as relational social space; the creation of conditions for the emergence of fugitive mobilizations immanent to the event. 
The propositional techniques/platforms for relation included : 
WaterBios (Or, Semi-Random Acts of Autobiography), Astrida Neimanis (with Kay Rozynski) ; 
2 x Conceptual speed-dating (readings: Erin Manning ‘Against Methods’ and Elizabeth Povinelli ‘Transgender Creeks and the Three Figures of Power in Late Liberalism’, Lone Bertelsen, Kalvero Gulson, Andrew Murphie and Stephanie Springay ;
Hello Birdie!  Playing With Avian Affect, Mindy Blaise and Affrica Taylor (Common Worlds Collective).
