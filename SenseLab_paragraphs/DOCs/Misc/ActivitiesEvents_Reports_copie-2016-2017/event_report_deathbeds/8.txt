Description tirée de http://deathbedssymposium.blogspot.ca/ :
« Circumscribing those zones of immediacy necessitated by an expectation of expiration, whether private or collective.  Modalities of heightened attention, accelerated signification & hyper-causal interrelation states & things.  & that there is a thing –– a “body” –– presumably present, the cause for alarm, determined to imminently & irrevocably shift, even as or if its form might appear to change very little.  So the symposiast's occasion is for engaging anticipation –– a holding-of-space or pre-occupation –– in/amongst settings/formats in partial repose, but expeditiously. Or theoretically, colloquially implicative. »
