The collaboration between SenseLab and ECSA is an attempt to rethink and create value – a new economic space – out of the turbulent flows of metastable collectivities. Or to put it schematically: how do we anarchive the value stored in money-form in order to distribute it anew? By opening up the monetary technology and experimenting with the design of its constitutive elements, we can develop new modes of psycho-social collective individuation. This is fundamentally an ecological problem, one that requires assuming perspectives and operating within a dense web of partially inclusive/exclusive entanglements. This ecological transformation of money enables folding and unfolding of n-dimensional relationships that dissipate value in impersonal, generative ways. Ultimately, re-designing money and financial processes aims at making a shift from the conservative neoliberal subject of interest to commonist and transindividual metastability.
