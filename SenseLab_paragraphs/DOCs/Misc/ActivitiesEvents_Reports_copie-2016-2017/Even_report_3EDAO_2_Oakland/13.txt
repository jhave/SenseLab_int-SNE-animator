Open Source the Economy OS
In the tradition of the Open Offices of Robin Hood Cooperative, ECSA organised an extended weekend of intense open workshops in Oakland November 11.-14 under the title Open Source the Economy OS. We believe that economic, social and technological trends are converging so that we can design and build tools to take more control over the operating system of the economy. Unexpected breakthroughs happen when software architects developing distributed computing and smart contract platforms, thinkers of finance who can work its ideological and organizational potentiality, legal hackers, political activists and social experimenters capable of engaging in such design, artists who are imagining new economic worlds come together in an inclusive atmosphere.
