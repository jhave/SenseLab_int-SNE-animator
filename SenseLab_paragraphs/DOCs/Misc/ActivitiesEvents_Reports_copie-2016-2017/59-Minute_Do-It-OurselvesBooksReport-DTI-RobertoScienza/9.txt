Description of the Activity: During the event ‘Distributing the Insensible: Performing the Anarchive’, the 59 minute do-it-ourselves book was a collective bookmaking session that consisted of 59 minutes (real time) to a team to make a short book (tyically 24 pages). We made six books out of these sessions and published them online (there is also an additional retrospective book on the guiding concepts of past immediations events). The books were made with photos, cellphone images, short texts, poems, key concepts, conversations, ideas and simple designs. It is important to highlight that English is not everyone’s firts language in SenseLab so there is a lot creative using of English and there was no standardization of such language.
