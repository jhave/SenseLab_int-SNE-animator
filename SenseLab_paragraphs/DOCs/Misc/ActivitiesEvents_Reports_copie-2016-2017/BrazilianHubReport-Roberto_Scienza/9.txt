Description of the Activity: Since May 2016, weâ€™ve been reading texts that interest the portuguese-speaking members of SenseLab (mostly brazilians) and then gather to discuss these texts. It was (and still is) an interesting and dynamic reading group that does not follow any chronogram. We just skip to a new text whenever we want to; collective interests are what move us from one text to another. If a discussion we are having can be clarified by reading a book suggested by one of the members we just go on and skip to this new book. We first take a close reading of the text and then make comments on it to start discussing a concept, a doubt, an idea or a thought.
