Outcomes: This conference was a very enriching experience for me once I was able to understand a little bit of Whitehead’s work along with the reading groups we did before the conference. It was also very interesting to understand how Whitehead’s thought still echoes today and how it can be applied to Art-making and Ethics. The paper presentations and propositions were very well received by the participants, who were interested in the different approaches and destinations that Whitehead’s thought can take us.
