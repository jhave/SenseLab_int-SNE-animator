Description of the Activity: A Whiteheadian Laboratory was a conference on the work of the British Philosopher and Mathematician Alfred North Whitehead. The conference had as its center the following question: How do we make ourselves a proposition? A proposition, according to Whitehead, is something that awaits for its logical subjects to feel it. It is a ‘’lure for feeling’’ for a collectivity to come. Brian Massumi and Erin Manning gave us a public lecture around the theme. During the three days of conference, there were paper presentations, a game of conceptual speed dating, and a few propositions, reflections and discussions related to Whitehead’s thought.
