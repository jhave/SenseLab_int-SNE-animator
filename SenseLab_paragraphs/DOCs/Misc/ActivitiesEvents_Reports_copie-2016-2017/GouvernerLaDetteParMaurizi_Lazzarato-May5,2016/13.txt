The seminar has been conducted in French with English moderation.   In this talk, Maurizio Lazzarato presented an overview of the main themes of his upcoming book " Wars and Capitalism", co-written with Eric Alliez. Building on both Carl Schmitt's argument that the economy is the continuation of war through other means and his previous work on debt economy, Lazzarato particularly interrogated the pivotal role of financial capitalism in indexing race, class, gender, sexuality and subjectivity to the logics of both military and non-military warfare.  Maurizio Lazzarato, born in Italy, lives and works in Paris.
