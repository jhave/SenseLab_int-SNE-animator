Description of the Activity: This event will wonder about other ways of thinking-feeling the contemporary and its imperceptible share. How can the contemporary’s potential be “traced” back and forth? What is the relation between the insensible and the untimely? What is the difference between experiencing a present potential and judging a future possibility? If there is a sense in which the present is pregnant with futurity, what does this say about our notions of the linearity of time? What kind of eyeless “vision” would make the forces of futurity felt? What other ways are there of thinking about the form of time? What does it mean to share–across the texture of togetherness–that which cannot be reduced to a single being? What does it mean to distribute that which cannot be given as such? Distributing the Insensible will be designed towards an ethics of care: one that carries the force of the propositional as a lure for a sensibility to come. How can that force be tended?This is the question of the anarchive.
