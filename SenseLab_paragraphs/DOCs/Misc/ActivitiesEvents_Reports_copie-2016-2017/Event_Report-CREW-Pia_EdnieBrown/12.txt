This research exhibition and associated events was funded by an OLT project grant (2016-2017). It was part of a national, scholarly conference, iDARE held at The University of Melbourne, VCA. Three conference keynotes, Professor Jane Rendell (UCL, London), Associate Professor Steve Loo (UTAS) and Oron Catts (SymbioticA, UWA) were actively engaged in leading two hour long, public discussions in direct response to the exhibition.
