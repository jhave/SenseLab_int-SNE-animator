The Creative Research Ethics Workshop (CREW) was concerned with how the immediations of research-creation can potentialise and activate ethical conduct in research. It was approached through techniques developed in prior Immediations/Senselab workshop, and involved creative practice researchers from multiple universities in Melbourne, Victoria. Starting in August 2016 with a two-day intensive workshop, the group continued and expanded through a month of weekly gatherings inside the Occupied exhibition at RMIT University’s Design Hub, leading to a series of contributions to the iDARE conference ( HYPERLINK "http://idare.vca.unimelb.edu.au/" http://idare.vca.unimelb.edu.au/), including an exhibition, workshop/performative events and a conference bag/kit that operated as ‘seeds’ to activate questions and dialogue about ethical know-how.
We started with questions such as: What if the development of ethical expertise was approached as an integral part of creative practice research? How best might we tailor a process of creative, ethical deliberation? And, could this help leverage an enduring cultivation of ethical know-how? Practitioners opened up their practices for discussion and explicated their approaches to a range of challenging, delicate and thought provoking issues. We developed a set of shared understandings about the intrinsic collectivity of ethics, the importance of slow negotiations of difference and situated particularities, the value of face-to-face dialogue as part of ethical deliberation, and how an ethical disposition might evolve through cultivations of enchantment.
