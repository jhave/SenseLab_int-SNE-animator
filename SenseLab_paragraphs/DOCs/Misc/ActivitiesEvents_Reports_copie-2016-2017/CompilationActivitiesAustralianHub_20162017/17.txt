The event resulted in a new kind of ‘box’ proposition made from a felting, knitting and weaving process developed by participants over the event from the roll of rope present at the December 2014 Immediations event. The ‘box’ contained a number of other propositions and fragments from this event to be relayed to Aarhus by Lone Bertelsen.
