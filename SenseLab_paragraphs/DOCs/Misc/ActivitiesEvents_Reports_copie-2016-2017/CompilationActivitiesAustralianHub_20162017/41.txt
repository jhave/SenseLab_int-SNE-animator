Enabling constraints: the flavour can be expansive but needs to have consistency. The flavour needs to have the potential for launching an island, which only a collectivity can inhabit. The flavour needs to allow for a simultenaity of durations, especially as expressed by Deleuze's idea of a simultenaity of presents (in 'Peaks of Presents...from the Cinema II extract I posted up here on the hub): a present that has passed, a present that is passing, a present that has not yet passed. Think flavour as interval. A flavour, for example, could be a whiff of photo, combined with a section of rope and some zest!
So,please bring along a flavour....let's see how an anarchive tastes!
