Description of the Activity:
From a range of perspectives across the arts and sciences, this panel will discuss the ways in which embodiment operates within and arts works, which take on a dynamic evolving "life" of their own. The panel will attempt to make explicit the “more than” which cannot be determined by initial conditions. In this indeterminism there is an inherent embodiment, which is why it is such a radical a development in science and so different from classical scientific perspective. 
The scale of evolutionary time impinges upon but can also be affected by the scales of action and modes of sensing that accrue and intensify in the shorter timeframes of inter and intra-actions. These processes and their durations impact upon a system’s viability. The panel will discuss the mechanisms involved in the evolution of dynamic systems, whether an organism, a person, an affective field or an artwork, which would address the frames of reference that include: 1) Dynamic and Enactive processes that mutually co-evolve, co-construct relationships from which an individual, a collective and an artwork emerge; 2) Exaptive capacities that reuse cognitive processes that separate and join internal states and external conditions and 3) Adjacent possibles that point to the way Art might be understood as a catalyst for producing alternative environments ready-to-be-made.
