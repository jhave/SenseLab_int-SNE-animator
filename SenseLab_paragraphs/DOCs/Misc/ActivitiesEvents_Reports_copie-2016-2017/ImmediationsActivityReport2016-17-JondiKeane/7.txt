Description of the Activity: 
This paper explores the ways in which our movements are mediated, imagined and performed necessitates transdisciplinary and creative research techniques. This paper examines the collaborative interactive artwork PAN & ZOOM to explore how performative and embodied experiences of spatiality and mobility can be induced and produced. The artwork amplifies mobilities instilled in the global languages of cinema, photography and mobile media to open up spatial affects and alternative experiences of movement. Audiences become participants in constructing movement experiences, where spatial and perceptive movements operate across actors, scales and sites. Using a variety of literature from mobilities, philosophy, creative arts, Actor-network theory and geography, the paper contributes to emerging discussions in mobilities on creative research and the capacity for arts to engage audiences through applied and practice-led techniques. We explore how media and art practices can induce new affective movement practices and perceptions of mobility. Through the examination of an interactive artwork, we argue that new capacities to move within mobilities emerge from creative technics which, in turn, make it possible to extract affective resonances that inform and transform our daily lived experiences of movement.
