** Relation to Immediations project
Each of these outcomes has been in dialogue with the ideas processes, approaches and techniques under consideration and collective inquiry through the Immediatons grant project. My specific interest concerns the relationship of an organism to its environment, reconfiguration of sensing, the experience of concepts and the experience of space and time (spatiality and temporality). These areas of inquiry are either the content of my written work, public lecture and conference and presentations or shape and guide the research creation / practice-led research in which I attempt to materialise the condition by which we come ot understand the complexity of our lived experience.
