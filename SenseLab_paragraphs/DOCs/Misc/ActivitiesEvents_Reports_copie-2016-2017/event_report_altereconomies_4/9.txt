Fourth of a series of meetings in preparation for the summer residency with Askeli Virtanen and Pekko Koskinen, members of Economic Space Agency, whose mission is to design P2P finance as a terrain for new human interactions. Their mission is a social platform where people come together to create finance: to share stakes and ownerships, open joint opportunities, risk & speculate together, align mutually benefiting interests, bootstrap things into existence out of nothing.
