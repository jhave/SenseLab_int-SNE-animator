Five (5) days to practice being and becoming-animal through the Body-Mind Centering (BMC) and to embody Developmental Movement Patterns (also referred to as the Neurocellular Patterns). Echoing Brian Massumi’s What Animals Teach Us about Politics, the workshop explored our Development Movement Patterns and their phylogenetic animal connections through the proposition of experiencing “pre-vertebral cellular life” to “vertebral crawling” stages in physical proximity, extending then to co-created improvisational scores and compositions.
