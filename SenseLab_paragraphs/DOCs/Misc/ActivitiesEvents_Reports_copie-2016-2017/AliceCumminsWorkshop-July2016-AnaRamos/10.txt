Engaging with this somatic work allowed for a direct perception of the event’s subjective form. The concept of immediation was at the heart of this exploration through the practice of a shared field of moving and playing, allowing thus for the emergence of a group-subjectivity conveyed by the event of coming-together. For the participant-percipient, this practice takes form along two axes. First, there is the act of embodying the group-subject event: “participation” itself. Second, there is an awareness of a distinct “event intelligence” (what Whitehead would call mentality) taking form through an auto-organization of feeling and flow of creativity, embodied in touch and movement.  Hence, every participant could sense the qualitative rhythm of something greater than itself and conjointly in-form this evolving formation. For instance, the “pre-vertebral cellular life” experience was especially able to bring the sensation of being at the heart of relationality, of inhabiting relation as an almost tangible space. There was a capacity, in the event, to bring awareness to the multiple layers of our being – both actual and virtual – doubled by a subtle perception of the multiple layers and different durations of the event.
