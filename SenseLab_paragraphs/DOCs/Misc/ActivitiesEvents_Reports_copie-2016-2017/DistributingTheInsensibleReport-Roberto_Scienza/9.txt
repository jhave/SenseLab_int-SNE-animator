Description of the Activity: Distributing the Insensible: Performing the Anarchive was an event in which many members of SenseLab were in Montreal to think-feel the Contemporaneity and its potential propositions. We built since september something that we called an anarchive. During the anarchiving process propositions and performances were made and several gatherings for collective thinking and doing. In December, already during the event, we gathered for close readings of texts, discussions, films and performances. We produced an expressive number of books of many types, forms and contempts and we proposed (and attended) to propositions related to the event. There was also sporadic potlucks so people could meet each other beyond Academic barriers.
