Outcomes: We had to develop a product by the end of the event. This urgency to produce was, although demanding for some people, also really stimulating. During the event we had questions around what is a book and what a book can do and we produced an expressive number of books of many types, forms and contempts. These books reflect the thoughts that were emerging in the event. It was also a very interesting and enriching experience to meet more SenseLab members and to see, read and specially to listen to their partipations during the event.
