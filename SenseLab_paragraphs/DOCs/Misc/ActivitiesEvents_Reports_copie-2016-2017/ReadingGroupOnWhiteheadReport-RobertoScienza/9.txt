Description of the Activity: Three months of close readings of Alfred North Whitehead’s work before the Whiteheadian Laboratory – a Conference that part of the SenseLab attended in Claremont, California, USA in December 2016. Twice or three times every month from september until november 2016 we combined to read fragments of Whitehead’s books like ‘Process and Reality’ and ‘Religion in the Making’ and then gather and discuss these texts at SenseLab (some of us phisically and others by Skype). We mostly speculated around Whithead’s philosophical concepts once understanding these concepts definitely can help one to understand Whitehead’s thought and to sense how his philosophy works.
