The research-creation activity involved first a brainstorming session with the Immediations Anarchive research group to discuss modes, methods and approaches for creating archives.  This led to a facility tour of the Post Image Lab to explore digital print options, available resources and technical support.  The activity culminated in a hands-on cyanotype printmaking working at the New City Gas Artist Studios.  This analogue, camera-less printmaking technique emerged out of interest creating direct action archives of objects, artefacts, motifs, documents, words, maps, and images.
