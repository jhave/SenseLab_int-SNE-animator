This installation was a direct outcome of some of our thinking with the larger SenseLab community about state sanctioned violence against the Black community. It grew from earlier conversations about race, social justice and affect. This installation inspired conversations at the World Social Forum about how people perceive the social emergency, the moment, and what to do as activists and artists. The installation was also used during our 2017 Social Emergency Response Center.
