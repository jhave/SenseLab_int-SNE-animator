As part of our on-going thinking about the social emergency, we moved from our first written piece, A Case for Social Emergency Procedures, to an installation aimed thinking with people and coming up with more specific social emergency procedures. We prototyped two visuals—based on familiar emergency procedures—to help people recognize and respond to social emergencies. We began to test them with artists and activists at the World Social Forum in Montreal during the summer of 2016.
