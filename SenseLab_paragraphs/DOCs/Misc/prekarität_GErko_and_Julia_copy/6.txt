There is a form of power exploiting the precarity in its doubleness. Precarity as Bourdieu and other sociologists argue, is a form of power (Bourdieu, Precarity is everywhere), which controls the future in its openness. The cutback of state security and welfare systems paralyses the precarious individual. Thread is the only generic force. Crisis becomes generic. But it does not allow for the new: The Openness of the future is used as the greatest thread by neoconservative politics. 
Precarity becomes a technique of gouvernementality by transforming the openness of the future in a state of total closeness at the very same time: Everything can happen but nobody can do anything about it. Precarity becomes a milieu of thread by occupying the potential for change.
