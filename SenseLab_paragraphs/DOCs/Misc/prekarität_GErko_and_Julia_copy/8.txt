How to create precarious experiments? 
Become multiple: be excessive, mutate, express.
Create situations that are neither over- nor under determined. 
Create liquids, which allow crystallization. Mind the precarity of the liquid: neither too thick nor too thin. 
(But:) Don’t be harmonious (too).
Don’t create experiments that represent the world or falsify a given thesis. 
Create machines instead.
Interfere with your experiments: become part of the resonance, the rhythm of in/stability. Rhythm creates diagrams not representations.
Experiment with the uncertain: The World is not a whole, no system unites it all, so there are no laws of nature to be represented by the experiment but singularities to arrange. 
Create “milieus of resistance” to the closing of the openness of the future.   
Alter forms of power to forms of resistance: Deleuze writes in his book on Foucault about Life as resistance to Bio-Power. Also affect is a form of power and resistance. So:
Move from precarity as a form of power to precarity as a form of experiment and resistance. 
Don’t rule with crisis, don’t rule with harmony.
