3. Experiment!
Why experiment precarity? Experiments do not represent the ecological system, its rules and laws. They cannot be reduced to the sciences, they are in between science, arts and the social. Ecologies itself experiment (Darwin, On the Origin of Species) and experiments are ecologies. They are created by precarious milieus of change. They create precarious milieus of change. They are movements toward the openness where the unexpected can happen instead of reproducing the already known.
