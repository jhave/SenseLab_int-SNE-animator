What is an affect? Where does it take place? How does it constitute the self? Specially in Les données immédiates de la conscience, Bergson points out two sorts of multiplicities : confused and distinct. The first one refers to immediate consciousness and is related to the affective dimension of the body. It comprehends those elements of experience which constitute the body at a virtual/abstract level. They self-organize themselves as heterogenous synthesis – sensations – which act as qualitative multiplicities. The second kind of multiplicity takes hold on the reflective level of consciousness. It involves the symbolic activity of representing things and thoughts in a distinct manner. What happens there is like the peak of an iceberg in the complexities of experience : it is directly affected and constituted by the affective dimension of consciousness. Then we no longer refer to sensations, but rather to emotions as they are “the sociolinguistic fixing of the quality of an experience” (Massumi, 2002 : 28).  These two dimensions of the body – affective and reflective – work conjointly to form the self as an ongoing process which only death stops, not at all pre-constituted, but always becoming, adding to itself. To ask what it means to have a body and, as Spinoza, what it is capable of, requires to start by acknowledging these two dimensions. What Bergson asks us to do is to consider qualitative duration as a foundation of all affective phenomena. This grants us with an alternative mode of understanding reality : one that links thinking and feeling in a rigorous manner allowing thus for a consideration of the autonomy of feelings. We can then seize the act of prehension as an event of body-worlding in which knowing takes place in a complex relational field composed by affectional facts.
