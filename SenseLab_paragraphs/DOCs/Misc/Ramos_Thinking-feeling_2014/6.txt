Biography
Ana Ramos is a Ph.D. candidate in the department of communication at the Université de Montréal. She is also member of the SenseLab, a platform of experimentation of the thought-in-movement engaging in collaborative practices focused on research-creation, micropolitics and philosophy located at Concordia University in Montreal, Québec. Her current research is dedicated to a better grasp of the invisible processes which act as a foundation for experience through the concept of the virtual. What interests her the most is the diversification of modes of perception through means as immersive technologies and the techniques of the body. Her most recent publication is “Du dôme au milieu : notes” in Archée, revue d'art en ligne : arts médiatiques & cyberculture. Her forthcoming publication, in the same online journal, “L'événement-dôme” establishes the Satosphere (an immersive theatre built at the Société des arts technologiques, Montréal) as an autonomous entity emerging as an animated process.
