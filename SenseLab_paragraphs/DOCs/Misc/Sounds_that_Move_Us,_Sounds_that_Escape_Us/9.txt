Orienting around the sounds of alterity (of the alterity that is the share of our more-than humanness, of the alterity that is black life, of the alterity that is neurodiversity) this course will be an experiment in listening to that which we do not yet know how to hear, or to that which we hear much too clearly (and can’t fathom how others are not hearing it). It is a course that asks us how we might create conditions for a different kind of hearing, a hearing-with or a hearing-across. Culling for key texts from the Black Studies tradition as well as texts from indigenous, palestinian, neurodiverse and queer scholars, we will listen to the interstices between the words and ask not only what else we might be able to hear but what the stakes are when learning begins to include what it works so hard to exclude. Through art and cinema, through philosophy and cultural theory, we will explore how else this learning might happen.
