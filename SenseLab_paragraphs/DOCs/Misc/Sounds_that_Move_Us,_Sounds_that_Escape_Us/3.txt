In a recent talk given at Concordia (March 2017), poet and scholar Claudia Rankine told a story about a tall black woman waiting in line at the post office. A white man walked ahead of her. The woman at the counter said “sir, the woman behind you was there first.” The white man said “oh! I hadn’t seen her.” The black woman said “you must be in a hurry!” He said “no, I just didn’t see you.”
