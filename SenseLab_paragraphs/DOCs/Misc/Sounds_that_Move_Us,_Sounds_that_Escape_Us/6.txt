Culling for key texts from the Black Studies tradition as well as texts from indigenous, palestinian, neurodiverse and queer scholars, we will listen to the interstices between the words and ask not only what else we might be able to hear but what the stakes are when learning begins to include what it works so hard to exclude. We will also listen to each other to hear the differential in the account of what is missing, of what is left unheard.
