This course takes as its starting point the realization that we are always missing things. We are not hearing them. Not seeing them. Not even noticing we are not noticing them. We will ask: what is it that we are missing, and how can we attend not only to the fact that we are missing it, but that there is a politics to what we are (not) hearing, (not) seeing?
