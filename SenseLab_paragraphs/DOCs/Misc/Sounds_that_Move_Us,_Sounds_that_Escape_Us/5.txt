Orienting around the sounds of alterity (of the alterity that is the share of our more-than humanness, of the alterity that is black life, of the alterity that is neurodiversity) this course will be an experiment in listening to that which we do not yet know how to hear, or to that which we hear much too clearly (and canâ€™t fathom how others are not hearing it). It is a course that also asks us how we might create conditions for a different kind of hearing, a hearing-with or a hearing-across.
