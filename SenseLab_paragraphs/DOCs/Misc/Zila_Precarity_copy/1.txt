We endure to create, to resolve and after all it is a system of wishes in which our children are wrapped and thrown in the open to be engulfed by a mist of poisonous. Wishes revolve dirt to inseminate a conscious wakening to just awake and to be embraced by a bear hug, hidden by softness and pretend we are fine. A change must be around. An incorruptible dream  is to force to reorganize a fragile system of affectiveness.
