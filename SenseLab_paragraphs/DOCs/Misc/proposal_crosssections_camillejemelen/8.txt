The black and white film photographs stand for the witnesses of a traumatic experience. Featuring no human presence, they freeze in time the last physical traces of what has turned into an absence, reflecting on the indexical quality of photography. Deprived from the presence of who was once loved, the gaze becomes tactile and enters on a level of intimacy with the absent subject for the last time, through the objects and place. Darkroom developing and physical alteration of some of the images re-create and reinforce this tactile connection to experiential memory.
