The Choice is a mediated intimate reflection on the end of a love relationship. Memory, affect, language, time and space are discursively brought together, creating different layers of signification and sensoriality. This artistic project emerged out of the need for a personal catharsis toward mourning of what could not be apprehended as a rationally understandable phenomenon. I am particularly interested in the audience reception of the work, as both parts solicit the physical, affective and sensorial participation of the spectator.
