After she completed in 2013 the Graduate Diploma in Communication Studies, Camille Jemelen is currently doing research-creation in the MA in Media Studies at Concordia University (Montreal, QC). Her artistic practice is articulated around performance, dance, photography and video, and addresses questions in relation with experimental film, self-narrative, performativity and feminism. Her MA research-creation project is looking at screendance and experimental documentary, working with a French modern dancer around the topics of embodiment, politics of ageing bodies and transnational collaborative processes.
