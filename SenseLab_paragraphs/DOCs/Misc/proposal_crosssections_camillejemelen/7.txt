The interactive database film was made using the open-source Korsakow software. It is an experimental self-narrative that proposes a non-linear experience of a fragmented, lacunar memory of oneâ€™s love experience through visuals and voice-over. Digital photographs illustrate different places and details that were once experienced along the relationship. Each of them is associated either to a literary quote from a novel, from a poem, from a song that where encountered at different moments of my individual affective constitution, or to a personal piece of writing related to my affective experience. Personal experience of loss is associated with larger and maybe more abstract concepts under the shape of words that the viewer has to click on according to her/his own feelings, to move from one image to another. The film intertwines French and English, reflecting on the language of love in relation to literature and linguistic identity.
