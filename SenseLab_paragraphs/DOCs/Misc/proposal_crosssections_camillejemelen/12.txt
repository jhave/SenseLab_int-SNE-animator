Only a computer and Internet connection are needed for showing the Korsakow film. I would like the sense of tactility of the photographs to be shared with the spectators. The photographs would therefore not be hanged, but rather randomly disposed on a flat surface, allowing the viewer to touch them and look at them under her/his preferred angle. A not-too-small table should be enough space to show both the film and the photo series.
