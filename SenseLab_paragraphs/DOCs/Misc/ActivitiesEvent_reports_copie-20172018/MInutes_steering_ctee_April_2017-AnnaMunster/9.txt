Erin informed us that an international network of programmers is currently being created between Montreal, Aaarhus, Melbourne and San Fransisco to work on digital and online aspects of the ‘Ecologies of Practices’ stage of the project. Work will be done to link the ‘Anarchive’ digital and analogue material and transition it into stage 3 of the project.
