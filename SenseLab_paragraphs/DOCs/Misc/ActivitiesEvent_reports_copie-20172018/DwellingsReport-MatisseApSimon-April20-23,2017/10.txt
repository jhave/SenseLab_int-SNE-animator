Dwellings was a performative, immersive response to the complex Indigenous-Canadian relationship that addresses the history, realities and dreams of the Indigenous house and home, and its effect on the land and on our bodies. Over centuries there has been a massive displacement of our Peoples from their homes and homelands. This performance acknowledges this history and tries to bring forth the possibilities of home and land. Small audience groups “migrated” through a series of unconventional performance spaces on campus to experience themes ranging from the sacred to the abject. Led by Theatre professor Ursula Neuerburg-Denzer, in collaboration with Indigenous visiting artists Emilie Monnet (Anishinaabe/French) and Floyd Favel (Cree) the project includes works by Kanien:keha'ka media artist Skawennati, and Kanien:keha’ka scholar and storyteller Kahente Horn-Miller, Bear Clan. Dwellings connects Concordia students, faculty, researchers and artists across disciplines and communities including Centre for Oral History and Digital Storytelling, Matralab, Indigenous Futures Cluster + Obx Labs for Experimental Media, Topological Media Lab, and ending in the SenseLab. The final section at the SenseLab was a place to collectively process, listen and end the performance event with participation in any form necessary with and beyond the given prompts. The creation process was inspired by acts of indigenous resurgence joined with collected seeds of thought from the other performance spaces. The audience members engaged with clay that was collected into an installation over the course of the 7 performance nights as well as eating traditional Cree bannock and tea.
