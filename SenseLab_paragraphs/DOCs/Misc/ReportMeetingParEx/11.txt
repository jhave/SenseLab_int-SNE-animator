It led us to a description of our Public Kitchen Event in August, in collaboration with the DS4SI. The emphasis was put on the potential for collaboration and participation, as both Immediations and the Parc-Ex community partners have similar interests. Also, Charlotte gave weight to our proposition by mentioning Mike Hornblow’s performance in Indonesia and Australia, and our previous experiment with the "lack of information booth" in relation to Society of Molecules. Then, after our description, Martin asked, “how are we going to do that?”, concerned about the resistance we might find on the part of the Hassidic communities in Outremont. We don’t know how, but we know we will learn from the experience, we will perceive the procedures in their incipient forms. But this is a crucial question: how are we going to do that?
