Different forces and fields of intervention were sitting at the table. Some working more specifically with the 18-30 age range, others with women or children.
 
After a round-table introduction, Martin Huturbise, who has been designated by the City of Montreal to initiate a participatory event within the communities of Parc-Extension, moderated the discussion. Martin works at the Maison de la Culture and is in charge of the program Hors les Murs. The aim of the project is to be a prototype which can be extended to another areas in Montreal such as Petite-Italie or other areas for example. 
 
On the agenda: choose one project out of the two presented by Lynn and Prem.   	 
The idea, as Martin was saying, is to “mobilize the maximum of citizens” from the different communities living in Parc-Ex (more than 120) around a single project/activity. The true intentions or motivations being not only to dissolve the feelings of exclusion, isolation, uselessness, that some have and express on a regular basis, but also to talk about the history of Parc-Ex, its dynamics, its movements and stories. The activity is concomitant to a wider initiative taken by the City of Montreal entitled "Chacun son histoire".
