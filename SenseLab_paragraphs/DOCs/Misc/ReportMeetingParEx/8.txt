Several tangents were expressed with the collect of recipes:
-do a recipeâ€™s virtual map with infos such as photos or stories to express from where the recipes are from (locate a corner for example)
-to situate recipes in a timeline with the preferences of different generations to notice the little changes in the recipes through the situation in North America that sometimes do not provide the original ingredients. 
-the deconstruction of the recipes to emphasize the ingredients and their different locations in the neighborhood or in the city.
-to locate where ingredients are cultivated in the different community gardens.
