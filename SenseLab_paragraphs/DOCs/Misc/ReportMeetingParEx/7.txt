For Lynn and Premâ€™s project, groups will be formed (young adults?) and asked to collect recipes (audio&video recordings of how to make such or such dish), will post them on a website designed for that occasion. Merchants, neighbors, pedestrians, will be interviewed and invited to share their favorite recipes. This is where we mentioned the previous work the SenseLab did with the SAT event, where we involved a Mile End/Outremont merchant to assist us in gathering fruit for our string-dying experimentation.
