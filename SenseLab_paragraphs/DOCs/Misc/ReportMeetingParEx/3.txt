The meeting took place on June 12th 2013, at the Maison de la Culture de Villeray/Saint-Michel/Parc-Extension. It was primarily conducted in French, which raises interesting questions around how we and DS4SI will communicate with communities for the August event. How does language enable/hinder accessibility across communities, particularly those where French and/or English are not their first language?
