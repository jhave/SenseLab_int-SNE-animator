A visit of the community gardens is also planned. It was suggested to create a Parc-Ex Youtube channel--if not existing already--(where the videos can be posted). In so doing, there are expectations that the participants feel proud of what they're doing. Many communities, and especially new immigrants, would be surprised and happy to realize they have more ingredients, spices and food practices in common than they thought. Two recipes can look very different but use the same ingredients. Food is a convivial way of introducing and tasting a piece of someone’s culture.  
 
In 2010, the district of Parc-Extension celebrated its 100th anniversary. As someone said during the meeting, “now it’s time to think about the future”.
