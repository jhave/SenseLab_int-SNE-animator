We listened carefully to both projects presentations. The project on food was the one that metabolized the largest consensus, as there were some concerns that MineCraft would only appeal to a certain portion of the population, namely the 18-30 age group (which nonetheless constitutes more than 50% of the population), excluding other generations that have no idea how to use the technology. The activity around food is also more mobile. In contradistinction, the young adults are expected to be less interested or involved in the food-making process, than in eating the food when it's ready. Young adults and teenagers are often less patient and enthusiastic toward the process. It is likely less exciting as an activity in their eyes. One of the people sitting at the table, Sonia, mentioned a previous "collective kitchen" experimentation she had with children. This is something they are going to provide us with more information about, as there have been collective kitchen’s conducted in the ParcEx community previously. Lynn and Prem then inspected a kitchen onsite. We’re looking forward to hearing more about this.
