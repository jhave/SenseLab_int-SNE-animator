Building Movements 
Melbourne
June 17 2013
We  attended  to the  notion of constructed environments (buildings, clothes, landscapes, interiors) as active participants in ecologies  of  lived  experience.  There  was  particular  interest  in  how  we  can  more  explicitly approach  our  environments  as  spatial  research  devices,  i.e.: how  constructed  environments  can offer key questions and provocations in any research enquiry.  The workshop had an open-ended format that allowed a group of creative practice researchers to take some collective steps toward the Immediations project. 15 participants.
