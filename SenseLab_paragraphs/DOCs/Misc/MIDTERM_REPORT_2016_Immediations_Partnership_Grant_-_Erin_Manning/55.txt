SenseLab was invited to organize the international Whitehead Conference held every two years at the University of Claremont. Part of our call:  “What would a conference look like were it to take Whitehead's propositions about propositions seriously? It would look more like a laboratory of speculative thought, we propose, than a ‘marketplace’ of ideas. A matter of fact in potential, directly experienced, is enacted, not exchanged. What would it mean to make the conference form "propositional" in the way that process philosophy understands it? How would that reorient what Isabelle Stengers calls ecologies of practice, within the academy, as well as in the academy's relation to the world's awaiting collectivities-to-come?” 25 members of the SenseLab will join as well as 20 invited guests. This is a collaboration with the Whitehead Consortium and Claremont University Whitehead Chair Roland Faber. 45 participants.

The final international event of the series “recomposing experience” will focus almost exclusively on conceptualizing and creating the anarchive. While it is likely that the anarchive will take the full period of the grant to come to full fruition, it is our aim to create a material proposition that will be ready to launch by Dec 20.  This proposition will take the form of both a book and an online platform. 60 participants are expected from all hubs – Europe, Brazil, Australia, Canada/US.
