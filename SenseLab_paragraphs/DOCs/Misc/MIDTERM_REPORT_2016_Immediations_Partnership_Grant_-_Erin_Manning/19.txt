As initially proposed, we have worked on the two main themes outlined for the period from 2013-2016: “recomposing experience” and  “the anarchive.” Moving across both themes, we have focused primarily on the question of value in the context of research-creation (this has been the topic of many of our reading groups, as well as of our weekly making/thinking sessions). This has recently shifted to include a focus on alter-economies of exchange. This study of value is central to any consideration of how knowledge is framed and evaluated, which is a key issue in research-creation. Our work on the anarchive is directly concerned with this question. If, as we proposed in our original project, the archive is a way of framing existing forms of knowledge, platforms for activating what resists formal capture are necessary. Research-creation, we propose, is intimately engaged with such forms of knowledge that trouble existing categories. Considering the anarchive as the share of the event which exceeds archival capture but nonetheless alters the conditions of future events, the first three years of the grant have  been focused on how to become attuned to this share of experience. As we move toward our half-way point, our goal is to build two initial versions of the anarchive – one analog, one digital. This is the focus for the period from September-December 2016.
