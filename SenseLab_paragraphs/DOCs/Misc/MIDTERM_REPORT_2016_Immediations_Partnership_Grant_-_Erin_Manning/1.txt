1. General Overview
Immediations: Art, Media and Event was conceived as a large-scale partnership between 11 universities (14 academic research centres), 17 community partners, 21 co-applicants and 2 collaborators. Its goal was to formalize and solidify an existing network of collaboration (SenseLab - www.senselab.ca), while extending the collaboration to new community partners. Since the inception of the grant, we have extended this partnership to new universities (Humboldt University, University of Amsterdam, Babes-Bolyai University) and are currently working on adding several more: Leuphana University (Germany), University of Weimar (Germany), Universidad de las Americas Puebla (Mexico), University of Naples (Italy), Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina (Brazil), Universidade Catolica Pontificale SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil) and IT University (Denmark). Each of these partners is allied to a new co-applicant, in all cases professors whose investment in the Immediations Partnership Grant has been exemplary. A new community partner in Montreal (Usine C) has been added. In the spirit of strong collaborative ties, we have also given up a few partners, either because they were no longer active (due to institutional closure) or because our planned collaboration reached its end.
