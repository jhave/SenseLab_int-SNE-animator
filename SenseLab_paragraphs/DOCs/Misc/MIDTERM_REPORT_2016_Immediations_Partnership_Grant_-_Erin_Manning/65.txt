Beyond Method: Infra-hub explorations
Cholula, Mexico

A Mexican hub is growing, though not formalized yet. This hub has been seeded by scholars in Mexico City and Cholula, who have been listening to our Skype sessions and travelling to Montreal whenever possible. Events in Cholula have been scheduled to support this strong interest. These events are directly concerned with the question of research-creation. Key questions include 1) how is value ascribed to process? 2) how do methods figure in the practice of research-creation? 3) what kind of decolonizing process must be considered in relation to re-valuing research practices?
