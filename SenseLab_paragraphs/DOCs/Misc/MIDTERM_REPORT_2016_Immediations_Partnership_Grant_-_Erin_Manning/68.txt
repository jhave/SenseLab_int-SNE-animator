Mols, Denmark
May 30-June 3 2015
The Immediations@MOLS organized by the EU Hub focused on the joint exploration of landscapes and water through research-creation workshops on sound, smell and water drawings, readings and performative engagements with the Mols landscape through a number of techniques. It extended the engagement with Urban Fabric(s) into experiments with material and political engagements concerning landscape and water and with an interest in developing anarchival techniques of event-ful continuity. 21 participants.
