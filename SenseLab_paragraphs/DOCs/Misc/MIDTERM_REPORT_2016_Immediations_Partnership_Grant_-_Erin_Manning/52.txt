Techniques for Neurodiversity
Montreal
March 12-19 2016
SenseLab welcomed Tito Mukhopadhyay and Adam Wolfond, both autistics who use text to communicate. Our time together began with a celebratory launch of Tito Mukhopadhyay’s Plankton Dreams (Open Humanities Press, 2015), where Tito led us through several neurodiverse thought experiments. Key questions that will continue to affect our research on “recomposing experience” include:
What kinds of modes of existence does neurodiversity bring into being? What techniques do the neurodiverse make operative to orient themselves (and others) in this predominantly neurotypically-inflected world? What else might the world look like (and feel like)  were neurodiverse techniques foregrounded in pedagogy, art, research-creation? What if neurotypicality weren’t the best place from which to collaborate with existence in the making? 25 participants.
Tracing the Anarchive
Mols/Aarhus Denmark
June 25-30 2016
After a year of anarchival exploration in each hub, an event was held in Denmark with the European Hub as well as emissaries from Canada and Australia, to unpack and explore the anarchives from each hub. Work on the concept of the anarchic share (Alfred North Whitehead) directed the event. An anarchival seed was sent back to each hub in preparation for the December 2016 event in Montreal. 25 participants.
