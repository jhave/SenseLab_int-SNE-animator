Physical Lectures
Montreal
Nov 13  2013 / March 12 2014
In collaboration with SenseLab, the Topological Media Lab and the dance department at Concordia. The goal of the series is to shift the format of a lecture in order to edify an exciting type of somatic forum. Rather than creating artificial bridges between processes of the physical diffusion and written publication of knowledge, "Physical Lectures" seeks to fold the articulation of both physical knowledge and theory into a cohesive physical-intellectual experience. 10 members of SenseLab, 150 participants.
