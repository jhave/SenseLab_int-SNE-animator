We have removed the following partners:
1. The Reversible Destiny Foundation because the founders have both died.
2. Aarhus School of Architecture because unit is being shut down.
3. Kolding School of Design because co-applicant Thomas Markussen has left the institution and joined our partnership at Aarhus University.
4. Artivistic because this partner is no longer operational.
5. Oboro because we have come to the end of our proposed collaboration.
