Following the objectives we set in place, we have worked consistently over the past 3 years to create techniques and platforms for organizing and orienting collaborative encounters that test the theory of immediation. In this, our focus has been on exploring the range of practices that orient research-creation, developing strong accounts of research-creation and exploring the theory of value and evaluation that research-creation brings when it comes into contact with academic institutions. All of these are practices of the event as it is described in our original document. Aligning the concepts of immediation and event, we have pursued the proposition that events are by nature unmediated: they activate the terms of their own emergence. How research-creation becomes an event, and what that event can do, have been key questions. This perspective takes research-creation beyond its alignment to artistic practice, opening it toward its trans-disciplinary potential. If interdisciplinarity was the orienting force of a shift in university practices in the last century, research-creation as an event-creating practice has the potential of redefining what the university can do in the 21st century.
