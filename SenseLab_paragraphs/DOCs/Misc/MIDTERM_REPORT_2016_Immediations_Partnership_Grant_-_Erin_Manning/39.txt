2013-2014
Once a month. Led by Co-Applicant Alanna Thain, Co-Applicant Toni Pape and Immediations Collaborator Ilona Hongisto This series approached the question of immediation by presenting documentary films that do not simply  represent or ‘document’ a  preexisting  content,  but that  contribute to the  creation  of  new realities.  The  central  concept  explored  in  this  concept is  that  of fabulation,  developed  by philosophers  Henri  Bergson  and  Gilles  Deleuze,  understood  as  a  creative  relation  between 
filmmaker, camera, ‘ social actor,’ and the viewer. 10-20 participants.
