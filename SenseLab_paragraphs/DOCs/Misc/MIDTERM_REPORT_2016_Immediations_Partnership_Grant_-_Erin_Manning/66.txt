Exploring formats of material experimentation generates new modes of thinking. Based on this assumption the material experimentation labs form a crucial element of the Zurich nodeâ€™s continued testing of artistic research contexts (two conference visits in Brussels and Geneva in 2014) and the development of research creation techniques (methods). The material experimentation labs inform the EU-Hubs general interest in material thinking in relation to practices of immediation and anarchiving. Experimenting with specific material, engaging a public in a series of collaborative situations
provides insights resonating with the embodied constitution of experience as one of the key problematics of the Immediations project. 12 participants.
