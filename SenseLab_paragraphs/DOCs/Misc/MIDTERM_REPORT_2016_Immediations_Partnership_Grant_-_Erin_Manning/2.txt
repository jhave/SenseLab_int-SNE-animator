The premise of the Immediations: Media, Art and Event as we defined it in the original proposal is that research-creation occurs at the intersection of different practices working in a variety of materials and media, both linguistic and non-linguistic (sound, image, movement, embodied interaction). Each of these intersecting practices comes with its own history and methods, and produces research results specific to that tradition. However, working together they are able to produce research results that could not have been achieved separately. Research-creation not only generates new knowledge; it generates new forms of knowledge that are essentially collaborative in nature. Our proposition was that in order for this collaborative innovation in forms of knowledge production to succeed to best result, the participating practices must find effective ways to rub shoulders in immediate, active contact with each other.
