Monthly. Knots of Thought is a mode of working-thinking between disciplines that pushes us to make perceptible the captures, blockages, intercessions and interruptions in our academic and artistic projects. The invitation is to share these knots, not necessarily to unknot them, but to explore collectively how a knot gives texture to a project. How is a capture an opening? Might we say that all thought unfolds from knots? What is a knot of thought? What strategies have we taken to tighten or unravel these? How do we work from them, cut into them, and open out new ideas from their densities, into new intensities? In tandem with Movements of Thought, this series invites participants to explore the strange performances of knots of thought. With partner Usine C. 20-30 participants.
