Event organized by SenseLab to commemorate the work of Partners Arakawa and Madeline Gins (Reversible Destiny Foundation) after Madeline Ginsâ€™s death in January 2014. Held over a 5-day period at Glasshouse in NY, we invited friends and collaborators of Arakawa and Gins to share their archive with us (through sound, performance, writing, story-telling). This archive is part of the anarchiving project. 18 members of SenseLab, 50 wider public.
