As Table 2 below demonstrates, since the inception of the grant in 2013, there have been continuous activities in all hubs, including the new hub in Brazil, which now hosts a reading group. This has given us the opportunity to develop our conceptual framework with rigorous detail in more than one location at once while keeping a strong connection between hubs by either co-organizing events during the same time-period, coming together as a whole, sending emissaries to other hubs, or working across hubs through virtual platforms. When we began the grant it was already a regular occurrence that members from other hubs participated in Montreal-based activities by Skype. This practice has extended to all hubs and has become an important way of relaying practices underway in other time-zones. Student exchanges and residencies across the partners institutions has also proven to create strong relays between the hubs.
