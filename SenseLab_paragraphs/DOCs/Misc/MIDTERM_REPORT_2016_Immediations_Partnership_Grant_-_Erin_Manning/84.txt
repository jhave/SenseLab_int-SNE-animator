Led by Immediations Collaborator Jaime del Val. The activities related to the Immediations theme on "Recomposing Experience." The installations and performances were designed to create an experience of the sensory extension of the body fostering a different relation to space than is usually the case. The event was an experience-based investigation into the way in which digital media can alter the sense of what a body is and what it can do. By creating this experimental relation to the body that takes it out of its usual framing, the project fosters a heightened awareness not only of untapped bodily potentials, but in contrast to these, of the limits of the normal parameters of embodied experience (the role of surveillance and other mechanisms of power in formatting day-to-day experience). In collaboration with Concordia Black Box and Hexagram. 20 participants.
