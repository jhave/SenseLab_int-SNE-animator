International event in 2 parts. Part 1: Lyndal Jones’s Avoca Project, north of Melbourne. Working within Jones’s project on sustainability, we explored the ways in which experience extends beyond the built environment to ask where else the archives of existence might be found. Part 2: NIEA, Sydney. In the university art gallery, we set up a propositional exhibition called Knotspace where we began to inquire into the archive we had built during the first event. 60 participants.
