3. Visiting Researchers, Artist Residencies
SenseLab welcomes regular visiting researchers, doctoral/MA exchange students, professors and 
artists. While we do fund 3-5 residencies/year (to Montreal or to other hubs) most residencies are self-funded. We integrate visitors both into SenseLab and into the Immediations Partnership Grant. This is one of our best outreach tools, as the visitors subsequently return to their own institutions, often connecting to the nearest SenseLab hub. Most visiting scholars and artists continue to collaborate with SenseLab long-term.
