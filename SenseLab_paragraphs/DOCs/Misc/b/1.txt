The unpaid internship is a procedure for precarity:
1. It puts those who cannot afford to work for free at a professional disadvantage, unable to acquire the prestige value of an internship. As they inevitably preselect candidates from a familial level of prosperity, unpaid internships actively reproduce social inequality. This is particularly disconcerting when such internships are offered in government agencies.
