But we can also observe this much closer to home, with respect to the Montreal student strike in the spring of 2012: the neoliberal dystopia where the “user pays” for access to any and all social interactions productive of knowledge and is made docile by the burden of debt was confronted by a social movement dreaming of an expanded commons that would encompass university education. Utopian futures clash. Ours and theirs do. There isn’t space for them all. Whose future, then? I suppose this is the first question that must be asked when thinking the politicality of time.
