For this reason, many theorists have called for ridding ourselves of a future that stifles the virtual potential in the germ of the present. Bifo calls for doing away with the residue of futurist utopias that still condition our activist movements. Only, after the future, he says, can a revolutionary society be constructed. Lee Edelman says, for (us) queers, there is no future. The future is for those who procreate (it). The heterozexualized present produces a procreational futurism in its own image. Procreation is the God who governs over the present; it holds the generative in its death grip, always folding it back onto the reproductive unit of the family (human family, art grouping, genre, etc.). Procreation demands that all newness bear a traceable lineage, bear the historical marks of its contemporaneousness. That the contemporary be read as such. That the contemporary claim its place on the family tree (genealogy of art).
