To unpack this proposition, think of the present not as a discrete instant following so many others on a timeline but as a remix. What we call the present is a remix of countless temporalities: the immediate past as the swing of the present, distant memories that return to color to the mix, the circadian rhythm that courses through you as an embodied expression of the Earth’s rotation, working hours as the call for efficient action, history as an authority looming in the background, expectation as time traced ahead, … . Think of the contemporary as the commingling of all these temporalities, the con-temporary as the textured “withness” of times.
