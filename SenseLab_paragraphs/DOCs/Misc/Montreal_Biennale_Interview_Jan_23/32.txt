Such a form of writing, I imagine, would need to write with a sense of openness to the work of art’s capacity for becoming-other in a different perceptual ecology. We could only ever write about a sliver of what the art is doing or can do, in order to respect its immanent futurity/uselessness. Such a form of writing, would need to dis-engage completely, I would imagine, from an argumentative style, from a mode of writing that argues for what a work is doing. Because in arguing for what a work is doing, means to ignore the inverse, to ignore everything that it is not doing but could – when activated differently, next time (in the future).
