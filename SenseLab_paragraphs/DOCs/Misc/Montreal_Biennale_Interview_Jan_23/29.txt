Good point. It seems then that the art of futurity, the futurity in art, is bound to a kernel of uselessness in art, a kernel that art maintains in the face of all sorts of instrumentalization. I suppose, from this perspective, that all art then has a useless quality, even art that has been put to the most uses. Because even such ‘useful’ art is still useless from the perspective of the not-yet-stirred up.
