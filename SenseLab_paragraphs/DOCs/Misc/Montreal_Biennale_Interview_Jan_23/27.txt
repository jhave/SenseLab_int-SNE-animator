What if art was queer to the core, engaging in only non-reproductive conjunctions? What if we gave art a vasectomy or a tubal ligation? What if art could no longer reproduce, pass on its forms of intelligibility, its way of being read, its clichés, its historical lineage? If art could not reproduce, wouldn’t it then have to advance on a generative register? Wouldn’t it have to generate new modes of valuation, in the absence of the possibility of reproducing old ones, in order to make sense in and of the world? Maybe art could only make sense as the passionate sign that you mention, passionate signs that carry possible worlds that they’re all wrapped up in. Without passion, would signs ever be able to carry with them new modes of valuation? Without passion, would the envelope wrapping the sign in potential even hold together? Without passion, could the sign ever be felt?
