But the Quebec student strike wasn’t a utopian imagining of a far off world. It was about how the prospects of the future make people feel now; about how the future is felt, immediately, in the present. The strike was intimately bound to the de-potentializing of the present, a present impoverished through debt, debt that chains its debtors to an eternal repetition of the same (a life of labour, repeating the motions of paying off debt one day at a time). Options blocked, potentiality impoverished, and yet desire erupting. New potentials arose in corners of the social field that could not have existed were it not for this original de-potentialization. Ce que nous entendions depuis les scènes de la relation c’était le hurlement, le mouvement de l’Ineffable, l’écho du chaos-monde se frottant aux cals de la résistance. The blocked, re-directed desire had to flow somewhere, and flow it did. Up against someone else’s future bearing down on ours, desire poured out of classrooms and workplaces and onto the streets. Desire for something else poured into the mix.
