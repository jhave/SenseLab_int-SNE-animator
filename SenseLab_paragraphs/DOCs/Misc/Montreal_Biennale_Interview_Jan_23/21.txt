For one thing, it means that art’s futurity is felt as urgency itself. We have called this desire, desire as that which needs to move, to flow. Another way to think of this is as time travel, movement, such as the mobilization of the student strike, as a repaving of our psychic landscapes with a renewal of potential. All sensed potential is thus a form of time travel, with the following imperative built in: “Et toi, comment assures-tu ta propulsion vers l’à-venir?” How does one enter the flow of desire, sustaining its urgency as a holding open of potential?
  
Despite the punctuality of art events, such as a biennale, the best art is always untimely as just this sort of time machine. Or better yet, a time machinics. Art is not an object or machine to be manipulated to specific ends. It is an invitation to travel with the flow of desire, the desire for something else. Machinics are rather invitations to connect, to alterify, to travel in time. How often is the response to this machinic lure its capture in machines of reproduction, the camera or iphone propholactically held up as a seizure of the heterochronic “withness” of art’s futurity. A postcard to a future self—I was here. How could we pervert this reproductive fidelity into an emergent alterfication of the self, which is only ever an alteration of the entire terrain of potential?  Put another way: comment voyage-t-on dans le temps? Il faut choisir ses capsules aion, à l’épreuve du temps chronologique. Il faut aussi s’assurer d’une bonne dose de vibrante futurité, sans quoi la temporalité maligne du futur antérieur risque de nous engouffrer.
