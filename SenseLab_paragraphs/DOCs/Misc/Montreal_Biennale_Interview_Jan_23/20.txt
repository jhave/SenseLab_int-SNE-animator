We are talking about relations to the other that are immediately self-relations to the future. We are talking about reclaiming the future for collective potential. Pourquoi ton abstraction doit être « self-detached » pour qu’elle puisse voyager? Tu dois fermer l’écoutille de ta capsule si tu veux voyager dans le temps. So: utopia never? If art’s futurism is thought of as utopian or dystopian representation, the future is held at a distance, help up for evaluation, measured against what we already know. A future at arm’s length. But when something moves us, this distance fails: it gets under our skin. What does it mean to claim the here and now as the siting of the future, to feel the remix as the jostling and displacement of our own cells?  After all, nothing divides and multiplies the individual so much as its own relation to the future.
