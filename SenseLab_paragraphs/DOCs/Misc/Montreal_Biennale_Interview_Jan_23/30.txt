How then, do we conceive of the relationship between what art stirs up – eventfully – and what it is used for? It seems like an ambiguous dividing line between the point where art stirs up movement immanent to its own existence and the point where art is deployed for its use-value. Perhaps the uselessness and usefulness co-compose in most situations where art is encountered. Example: avant-garde, non-representational art in a gallery that claims its own useless autonomy is already made useful by the gallery institution. How to avoid rendering uselessness an ideal, abstracted out from its being-made-use-of in the worlding it engenders?
