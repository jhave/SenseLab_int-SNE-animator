How can art speculate on the potential of the present (its immanent futurity) in a way that doesn’t use up the future? In a way that doesn’t over-determine it or instrumentalize it? We know all too well from contemporary finance capitalism that everything, including the future, is already speculated upon: minds, bodies, people, land, ideas, communication, etc.
