I would say ‘all of the above’ if art isn’t thereby subjected to just another project for the future with its own agenda and timeline. Yes, if all this can help make art less servile or useful. 
We have contrasted futurity, open-wide, with the narrow visions of a laid-out future. Accordingly, the arts of the future, futurisms, are useful, goal-oriented. Arts with a cause. The art of futurity, contrarily, cannot help but be useless because it doesn’t yet know what it’ll stir up.
