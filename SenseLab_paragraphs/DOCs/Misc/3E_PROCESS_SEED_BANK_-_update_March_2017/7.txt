There are many questions that this proposal raises that bear on how we design the properly economic aspect of our project. Would the funds be donatable in fiat currency? If so, where would they be held, how would they be administered (would 3E have to incorporate to be able to have a bank account), and how would decisions over use of the funds be made? If the 3E space really does interface with the dominant economy, these are problems we will have to resolve one way or the other.
