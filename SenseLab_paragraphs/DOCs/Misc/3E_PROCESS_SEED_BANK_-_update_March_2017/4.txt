The proposed smart contracts coming out of New York assume the "magma" principle outlined in the working paper "Adventure Capital and the Anarchive" posted earlier. As suggested in that paper, they operate at the edge or "membrane" of the 3E space. There are three types, two kinds of "entryway" and one we were calling an "endtroduction" (but I think needs a more intuitively understandable name that is specific to it â€“ perhaps "turnstile"?).
