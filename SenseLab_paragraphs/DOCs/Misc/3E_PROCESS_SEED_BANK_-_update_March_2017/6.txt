The second kind of entryway is the same as the first, but with a gift of funds. A person could donate funds, but like their own presence, the donation would not register until they also make a gift of process as outlined above. This rules out uninterested donations (gifts of cash by people who are not in any way involved). Once the gift of process is made, the financial gift is registered and enters the collective pool. At that point, the person donating the funds no longer has any individual ties to it or any power over it. It is a pure gift to the collective.
