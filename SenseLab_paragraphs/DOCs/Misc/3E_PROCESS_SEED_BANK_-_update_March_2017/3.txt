The discussions and brainstorming of the meetings led to our first success in imagining how smart contracts might work with our process. Smart contracts are necessary for the 3E platform to interface and become interoperable with other ECSA economic spaces and the Agoric cryptocurrency providing the general economic environment they share (see ecsa.io for information). We had earlier shied away from smart contracts because they tend to reintroduce the kind of transactional, exchange-based organizational mode that we are trying to move past. ECSA has always maintained that they could be conceived of in much more open and relational ways than might be suggested by the word "contract," and a part of our task that we hadn't made much progress on until now was to find ways to implement them that worked for our project.
