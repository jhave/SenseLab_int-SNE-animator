An alternative that avoids the mainstream banking system might be for the funds to be converted into Agoric, and from Agoric into Bitcoin, and then spent as much as possible in Bitcoin. This would have the advantage of supporting the Agoric currency. It would require the 3E project to have an Agoric wallet and a Bitcoin wallet, both of which once again raise governance and decisionmaking issues, for which further smart contracts would have to be invented.  A third alternative might for the funds to be converted into Agoric, and then (or perhaps just a portion of them) from Agoric into our cryptocurrency, Occurrency. This would support our currency. It would also open the possibility of having the gift not be a pure gift â€“ the person donating could receive some of the Occurrency for themselves, so that the donation also has an investment side to it. This would move toward making making Occurrency function not only as our resource, but as a money market (giving it the character of "commodity money," or currency that is itself traded and speculated upon).
