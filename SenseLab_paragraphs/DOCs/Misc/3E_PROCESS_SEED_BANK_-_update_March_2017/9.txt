The third smart contract will probably have to be a bundle of smart contracts. It would set the operating parameters for Occurrency, under a different aspect than the commodity money aspect just describe. As outlined in "Adventure Capital and the Anarchive, " the intensities of our creative process would be registered as the process passes thresholds of form-taking. The qualitative intensities of the process would be registered immanently to the process, but also be quantified in a way that spins off value externally, into the surrounding ECSA and mainstream economies. The registering of the processual intensities would  periodically "mint" a certain quantity of Occurrency. This would be Occurrency under the aspect of "equity money": basically, more like a stock than a currency in the familiar sense of a medium of exchange. The creative success of our process would be the equity "backing" the currency and giving it value. Further thinking and consulting with economists will be necessary to ascertain whether Occurrency could function solely as equity money, or whether it needs to have a commodity aspect as well. The issue is convertibility: Occurrency has to be convertible to the ECSA and Agoric currencies in order to participate in the ecology of economic spaces. How is the conversion rate set if there are no market forces at work, given that our "equity" (the surplus-value of life produced by our collective creative practice) is so abstract and fleeting? The "turnstile" smart contract would constitute the protocols of Occurrency's convertibility and circulation (creating mechanisms for it to be converted into ECSA and Agoric, and perhaps owned and sold by individual investors/speculators in addition to the collective pool owned by 3E project as a whole). It would also have to manage how decisions about spending the collective pool were made and executed.
