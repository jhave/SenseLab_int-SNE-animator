This conference presentation will discuss how contemporary Global Art Cinema makes depression felt. In order to explain how this is so, I will advance a number of ways that films that visualize depression make the experiential state of this very film felt non-representationally. Yes, that means that I will foreground the affective qualities of the cinematic image. But more importantly, I will illustrate how the image’s affective qualities work to construct images of depression that complicate and complexify dominant definitons of what depression is (as found in the DSM-V).  An example includes: how the use of mise-en-scène (the plastics of the image) are organized in Oslo, August 31st (Trier 2011) in order to express the sensation of living in a depotentialized world, having lost mastery over one’s own life (as is the case in Jean Oury’s definition of melancholy).  
	In the second half of the presentation I will gesture towards some equally terminological and philosophical problems that these  film examples present us with, because in providing images of depressive experience that are unrecognized by official discourses of depression, then can they really even be termed images of depression? I will suggest that the term melancholy aesthetics (which draws on a long tradition within art history) can be revitalized through the lens of affect by accounting for the heterogeneity of experiential states that do not neatly cohere with any stable definition that attempts to describe experience. In this sense, melancholy aesthetics may become a field of possibility for thinking the experiential states of depression, and the many experiential states adjacent to it.
