So by the time thats over I’m tired as all hell but this roast ain’t gonna cook itself, so I’m here, I’m here...doing that all evening...even though its nice out. And these pip-squeaks coming home like their still children! Acting like their still children...when is they ever gonna grow up I asks you? ‘Sept that one, she’s alright, LISTENS at least, that girl listens with one ear, HEY can somebody listen to me please?? The bread’s warm, can you please set the goddamn table? Hello? Some respect!? Can I can get some help around here?! GUYS. Hugo, tell your offspring to move their asses and get this dinner on the table.
