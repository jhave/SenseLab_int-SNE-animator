Vincent, Alex and Nerio react to what they hear. Vincent has no idea what happened, and is quite amused. Alex does know, and feels sorry for Monica. Nerio thinks every party is being ridiculous. They respond in gesture, a combination of their task and their character specific response to what they hear. They play off each other.
