For the love of God! I says to him, we’re out of onions, go get onions, please. Yes yes sure, in a moment...And I come back and there are no onions anywhere in the goddam house! Okay, I says to my self, fine, ill use shallots. (family FREEZE until she speaks again) Yeah...sure...I can just use shallots. So fine. so I asks her, like a sweet little angel, let me tell you, I asks her, hey my love, can you cut these shallots for your Ma? Maaa, she says, I’m just going out. I says, first, these onions, please? She says, Ma, these are shallots, and I’m going out.
