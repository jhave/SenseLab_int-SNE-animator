Francisco:
Laura. This demonstrates poor commitment and a bad attitude. The hours set for you are not flexible, they are serious. You cannot leave early, unless in a grave emergency.  I have to be honest with you, when I woke up this morning, I realized that this could be reason enough to let an employee go. But I am willing to give you another chance. Consider this a warning.
And Monica. I know you are new, and that you were put in a less than ideal situation. But if you are to continue here please know that you are not to ever work a shift alone. That is against regulation. Im sure you had good intentions, but, please contact me in the future to find another replacement employee if there is another problem like this. And also, please, fyi, donâ€™t call in an employee directly without letting me know. Everything goes through me.
