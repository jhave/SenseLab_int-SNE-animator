So Im here cutting away and he comes home. Don’t say nothing in response to me. Smells like shit...Bruno, I says Bruno, your laundry’s on the bed can you fold those things?? Silence from that man, no words, just a dumb look. So I asks him again cuz if you get no response then thats what you do I mean you don’t just sit there without no response. So I says, Bruno fold that motherfuckin’ laundry. And then the screaming starts. Fuck sakes.
