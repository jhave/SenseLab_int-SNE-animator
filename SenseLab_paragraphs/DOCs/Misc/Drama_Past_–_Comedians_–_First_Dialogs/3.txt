Erika: So, what’s next?
Tim: What’s next? We just finished out exams, let’s chill out and not think about it!
Emilio: Well I know what I’m going to do now that it’s summer. Sit in the park and play chess. There’s nothing more satisfying. 
Antoine: Sounds boring. Monika and are thinking about taking road trip to the Martimes to get away for a bit.
Group: Wow!
Monika: Well…
Antoine: Oh yes, well it depends on if Monika can get enough time off of work, but otherwise we would really like to.
Erika: If Monika has to work I’m sure there’s something we can find to do around here. I could use some help practicing for my job interviews.
Antoine: [Laughs] I’m sure Monika will be able to get the time off once she talks to her boss. 
Vincent: [Approaching Claire] Speaking of getting away. My parents told me that I can have the cottage to myself next weekend. Who wants to come with me?
Tim: Next weekend? Too bad, my summer baseball league starts and I can’t miss the first game. Where’s the waiter? I’m going to go look for another round.  You guys are alright with a pitcher of blonde? 
Group: Yes, Tim.
 Vincent: But can the rest of you guys make it for next weekend?
Erika: It’s really bad timing for me Vincent. I’m going to be preparing for my job interview at the architectural firm.
Antoine: Well next weekend is exactly when Monika and I plan to take our road trip together.
Emilio: Thanks for the invite Vincent, but I really don’t want to be in party-mode next weekend. I think I’ll just need some alone-time to chill out next weekend.
Claire: [Softly and seductively] I’ll come…
