Open Scene: Erika, Emilio, Tim, Claire, Vincent
Erika: We did it!
Group: Cheers! Santé! Cheers!
Tim: To be honest, I never thought we’d make it. I swear I could have died a few times over the last four years. 
Emilio: [Laughs] Yes, I think so Tim. I’ll never forget that time I ducked into the dépanneur to get a bottle of water on my way to our African music class and you were in there arguing with the owner about the price of Red Bull. I could swear you looked like an addict on the brink of a breakdown.
Tim: I’m pretty sure I almost failed that exam because I couldn’t get my Red Bull in.
Claire: Oh, don’t blame the Red Bull prices Tim. We all know you never liked to study.
Tim: [Laughs] Some things never change. But who cares, a pass is a pass. Time to celebrate, the learning is all over now. Let’s drink up!
Emilio: Hey, where’s Monika and Antoine? I know they are study partners but I imagine that they would have finished writing their exams by now…
Erika: [Coyly] Hmmm, well maybe they wanted to stay and study together a little bit after the exam.
Claire: Oh please Erika, stop being such a gossip. I’m sure they’re just taking their time, as always.
Vincent: [Flirty] I know you’ve thought about it Claire, you know, what they do together…
Claire: Oh stop Vincent, you know I don’t think about that kind of stuff…
Tim: [Distracted] Oh look, there they come.
Enter Monika and Antoine
Antoine: Hey you guys!
Group: Hey!
Antoine: Congratulations everyone!
Tim: Here, let me get you guys a chair.
Tim gets a chair. Antoine and Monika sit in between Tim and Claire. Vincent comes over to sit closer to Antoine.
