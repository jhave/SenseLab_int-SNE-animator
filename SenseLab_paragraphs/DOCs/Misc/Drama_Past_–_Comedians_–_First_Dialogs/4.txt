Tim: Hey guys, I’ve lined up some celebratory shots at the bar. Get over here!
Emilio, Antoine, and Erika leave to join Tim
Claire: So are you and Antoine actually going away together? It doesn’t seem like you’re very into  the idea.
Monika: It’s not that I’m not into it…
Vincent: I completely understand Monika, sometimes friendships don’t need to become relationships, no reason to force it. I think you’re laid back approach is the right one. [Looking at Claire] I’m going to go grab that shot with the boys and then be right back.
Exit Vincent
Claire: I’m so excited! I can’t believe I’m going to Vincent’s cottage…just us two! After everything that Tim put me through, I think that this is the romance I finally deserve. I know he’s got a wild side to him when he hangs out with Tim but other than that he’s perfect. I’m going to go find him, I’ll be back.
Exit Claire
Enter Vincent
Vincent: Monika, did you see where Claire went? I wanted to talk to her about this cottage trip that it looks like we are going on. What a nice surprise, I never thought Claire would be into me because she still seems to hang around Tim all the time even though they say they’ve broken up. Maybe this is the real thing. But it’s scary to think that maybe my days of long nights and free love are over. I suppose that makes sense, we have just finished our university degrees.
Monika: Just one more night.
Exit Monika and Vincent together.
