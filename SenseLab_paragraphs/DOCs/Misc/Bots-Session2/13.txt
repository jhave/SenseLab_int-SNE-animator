"My tendency is (with Deleuze) to think the dividual before the individual." I really really get this, and appreciate it as a kind of meta-framing of the space within which we live. But then why do we focus on landing? Where are we landing from that we would need techniques of the impersonal? It seems we act as though forces capture us and we are inventing ways back into dividuation, inventing ways to remember the dividual first.
