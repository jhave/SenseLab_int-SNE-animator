And so in a way I find that we're in a perfect position because, strangely we have nothing to lose. The event is not something we can bank, so we can't create an insurance policy for it. Anything we build will bring the unthinkable toward more unthinkability, and if 3E is a place, the workings of the process will already have taught us so many more ways to think finance beyond the normative modalities that we will be more experimental no matter what. And if on the other hand, we disperse, and SenseLab finds its end, 3E will still continue to grow as a proposition. Or if we become rich, well then there's that to contend with! ;-)
