And in my question I guess there already a clue “Why was I not able to be ACTIVATED with such an event of economical and political implications?” And I think the key here is ACTIVATION and I would wonder so, what are the techniques for differential activation, what how are they! Can we craft some of them? like with the bots we’ve been thinking, klepto-bot, go-to sleep bot (as an elongation of a different rhythm entering the zone), etc… and I think there it seems like silly work but the main thing is that is trying to touch upon through BUILDING those else-ACTIVATORS. Posting a gif of a flashlight, flashing a feeling, rather than something within the economy of “hey, I think, blah, blah and feel blah blah.”  Not discarding that or anything of what’s been said really, truly, more thinking, ok, yes, and what wabout directing attention to this tip for a while, which is a tip where we rarely direct attention toward, so like, would that craft different modes of engagement? ah ufff, still babbling!
