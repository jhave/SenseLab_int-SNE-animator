so how do we consider the dividuation of the value already being harvested from a place like senselab? Not the stuff we're getting, but the value getting sucked up through the Concordia vents. Meister would have us find the "chokepoints" in that production line and work for an otherwise condition by seizing control of those capturing devices. Can we think the offering as different from the gift, a multi-valent already-happening zone of relation? In this view, the give-and-take of the offer happens as a series of cuts that happen to us (our dance of activity highlighting the mass of already-there and not making something where there is nothing). If we know that our actions and desires have already been captured in this or that way, perhaps an offering is needed to unhinge our dividualities from a single frame? Practically, I've been wondering about individualized users becoming de-individualized through an automated offering system that both generates money, a market, and a thresholding into magma.
