"but how would they become deindividualized once individualized?" Aren't the rituals of introducing someone else precisely deindividualizing our selves as a collective therapeutic process? and Recognizing that we need such transformations constantly?

What worries me most is the force of the event. How do things happen and keep happening? when only 4-5 of us are on slack regularly we know we don't have an adventure capital (not much capital would come of that kind of participation). So do we only participate when the stakes are quantifiable? Of course that would be preposterous - we do so many things without quantification. But still, the collective pull is not so strong outside of the intensity of an event. So what makes the everyday return to adventure capital happen (if it's this return that we need to generate the activity which will somehow generate the funds?). This has been the key worry for me since the beginning... Because, of course, if our only real lure is to see how much money we're making we might as well just buy stocks... Help!!!!
