*how different money would feel* yes, I guess there’s work to be done in that SHIFT of affective VALUE
and how to work though it TRANSVERSALLY would be of interest no? Idn (I don’t know for sure, just dropping some cake decorations perhaps).

"we will have invented a new form of value that can perhaps survive the quantification at the threshold." - this makes me wonder whether it will not even need to survive as it will change the nature of quantification as it enters.
re "transversally" - i hear it like many entry, exit points, remaking the borders and boundaries that move. From the computational-financial side, but not just. like it make me think: perhaps not just re-engineering moneyness from the design of the money but also the different engagements with the spaces and times that right now our current money so successfully occupies and orchestrates. money is everywhere so there is at least a way into money (into its re-making lab space) through everything, each in a different way.
