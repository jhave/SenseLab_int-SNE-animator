As many of you know, I think the gender politics are really important. At the same time, I think that if we're looking at re-inventing life living, at the dividual-individual movement, and also how emergent ethics-aesthetics take form through the DAO, then I'm wondering how might it foster an opening into an otherwise? That's not to say that we ignore the gender politics and tendencies, but how can we affirm an enacting processual creativity through adventure capital rather than ones based on pre-existing structures? It makes me think of Brian's "processual duplicity" and the "schizz"..
