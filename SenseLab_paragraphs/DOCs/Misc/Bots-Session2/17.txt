For some reason I keep thinking that the way to consider money is that to consider a change in the way in which it participates, like it what if it re-bounces on the outside, peripherally. Like you use money to ‘live’ in the ‘goods’ sense of living but you are not paid to do something in exchange for it. You participate in the thresholding rather than in a sharing. You participate because of an intensified field of attractors that rub a mode-ing. But you participate with an event’s appetite rather than from individual desire. Haha, I’m just cutting with unrelated thoughts.
