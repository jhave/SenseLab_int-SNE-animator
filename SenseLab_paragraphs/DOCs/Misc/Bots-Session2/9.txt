The reason for money at the beginning is no longer for me to be a libidinal pull, in terms of the 3E DAO (where the relations enabled are marked as enabled by the money). Rather, I'm imagining that money at the beginning is a kind of melting down of that particular monetary force. We deform the money by subjecting it, bending it to processes it is not designed for. Automation helps with sensation, somewhat, even from the outset. But it could be designed to be even more helpful, I think, maybe.
