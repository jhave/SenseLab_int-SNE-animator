uh! aha! you are pointing to a very very crucial thing. It is like the question that kept resonating in my mind after Trump was elected and I felt terrible and I started thinking “now, there’s no other choice, now we have to do a lot, a lot needs to be done, now it is REAL” And then feeling so terrible with this thought, thinking, “Why was I only able to be activated after something like that happened? Like, why couldn’t I feel the RELEVANCE of the work that needs to be done before that with such STRENGTH?” I asked this to Ronald once. And this resonates with your question here Erin of what moves the COLLECTIVE doing that does not necessarily need those modes of economic-political pressure? Is it possible? What, how?!
An ethics of relevance?
