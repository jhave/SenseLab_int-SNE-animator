I also, with Mayra, feel that to reinvent life-living (which seems to me the call of the collection we're reading, understand life and finance as absolutely imbricated) there has to be a full reorientation toward capacitation and away from preimposed forms of value (including the value of the individual). Will we be able to create the conditions for that to be an economy of surplus? I think we already are. Will that surplus become money? Now that's an unanswerable question!!! But when I feel most despondent (or confused) I wonder if that's not mostly because what we're trying to do HAS to be unthinkable. What I loved about Meister's text was the passage through Marx (who I don't know well enough) as a reminder that Marx was thinking at the absolute limit, conceiving things that had to continue to be thought at the limit (think Foucault's biopower, long before neoliberalism really was known to us, and DG's thoughts on capital in Apparatus of Capture, which are so incredibly prescient). To continue in that tradition (if that were even possible, BUT IT IS!!!) would be to move into thinking-orientations so unknown to finance that they would seem impossible, crazy, unthinkable. Why would money be born of the good life if that good life remained an appetite, and even worse, a dividual appetite????? But what if it did??? Who ever thought mortgages could be bundled to create money out of almost-nothing????
