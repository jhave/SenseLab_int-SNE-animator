"So I think there's something about knowing that money is in the event but letting its cycles of surplus lose themselves while other qualitative valuation tendencies take form and crystallise" - i wonder how different money would feel in the event if it had an expiration date? its deity-like pull is so tied to its form as an immutable constant of value.
catching up with many great thoughts above^^^
