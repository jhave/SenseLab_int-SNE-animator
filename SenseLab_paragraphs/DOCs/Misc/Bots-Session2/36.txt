perhaps. But to answer your earlier question, what I would say (and I am only speaking of myself) is that all ideas are welcome but what is even more welcome is help BUILDING (not just theorizing). For us to get a sense of what we're working with, we need the magma, and for the past weeks it's been a very small group of us trying to create the conditions for coding it (with Leslie). Once we have that coded, I think we'll have to try lots of things out, and fail a lot. And ask hard questions about money and how it comes in and what it can do.
