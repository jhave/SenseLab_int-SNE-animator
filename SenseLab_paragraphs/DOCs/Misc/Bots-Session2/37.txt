Hmm, so interesting Erin. I'm also sensitive to the individualization of money and what that does to behaviours in the collective (particularly from the point of view of someone that doesn't have much but has, as you say, capacitations that are emerging out of my participation in adventure capital). It can be hard not to prioritize qualitative valuation in our life-living for some of us already. I think that is also a necessary consideration when thinking about valuation in the collective - that some people are already enacting alter-valuation systems on entering into the DAO.
I'm wondering what might a different end of the process be as you say Erin? Would it be at the moment when capacitations take form?
