YES! And I think what you're saying about bringing in money as a material is connecting to what Joel was saying.
And I agree with that - I just worry that THAT will be the lure... Sort of like my saying that the grant will be cut got us making. All of us were making all along, but the COLLECTIVE wasn't making. And then the collective was making. So all of us are already feeling the lure toward the more-than - in parenting, in loving, in music-playing, in writing. But how do we feel this COLLECTIVELY in a way that also generates a lure from the outside, because the economy has to connect to other rhythms (beyond ours) if we really want to generate funds.
I imagine if we said: let's all put $1000 in we would get more involved. But we would also risk having made money the value of our involvement. How do we get around that?
and I am so in agreement, Mayra, that we need to learn with what we learn and not try to reinvent the wheel each time! And that's SO hard.
