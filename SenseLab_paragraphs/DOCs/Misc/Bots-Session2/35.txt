would it change it if the money was fractional to one's GDP?
and i hear you Erin, about derivatives. Dick warns about taking derivatives as too magical in their own right, rather suggesting as you do that they are, at the moment, a larger industry than our very asset economy (25 times larger!!). that's where all these billionaires are coming from, that's where all my debt is coming from. you are right, derivatives are not the pure answer. they are, at the moment, heavily spoken for (if i understand dick right)
