This we would need to consider together, I think. What concerns me (but perhaps this is not a concern for all) is that money used at the outset still suggests that it is only through money that the social relation is quantified. If what we're looking for is another way to think quantification (Brian has sent his ideas to Dick but we haven't had a response yet - and this is also what we need to talk about in NY) that comes out of quality (rather than the other way around, which tends to be how the market works) what would be at stake by putting money in first? Would it matter that the access to money would necessarily be different for different people (because of their relative wealth?). I am not sure at all (either way!). And, honestly, I haven't at all been able to think the shift from quality to quantity.
