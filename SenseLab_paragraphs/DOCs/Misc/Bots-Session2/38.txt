Another thing I was thinking of: when people put money into ECSA perhaps someone else noticed it was all men? It was either men themselves Â or their "fathers" (in each case it was the father that was spoken of). So that should tell us something about the value of money, I think. That some of us feel we have access to it (through our fathers!) and some of us don't feel like that risk is possible (or we don't ask our mothers!). So what is money doing when it is investing, even at the small scale that some of us invested for ECSA? Is it not also telling us once again where the power/value lies? Or telling us who can speculate? When I resist money it's really because of that. I actually have a particularly easy relation to money - I can't quite care about it. So investing wouldn't be hard for me and I wouldn't much care if I lost it. So is a percentage the way we want to go? Perhaps. But would that risk suggesting that we can be the sum of our parts again? Aren't there other ways in which we value (become value, become surplus). You see where I am going... None of this is worked out (by me) - just thoughts that might be useful in explaining my uncertainty.
