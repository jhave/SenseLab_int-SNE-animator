I like that @jemason that “money is everywhere… through everything”. I love @andrew_m’ saying “everything is everything” and to think transversality with this and to think, if we work with a piece of paper and color could we be working transversally with money valuing ways already in-difference? Hahhaa, or is that too much of a stretch? If we work with VALUATION modes in improvisation of movement or sound making would these teach us something? OR is that too much of a stretch too… And then, how to thinl the STRETCH itself as a doing, as a something… ok, I’m going back to work. sorry, wont’ keep putting my poor-cake-skills around here... for now… joyfully walking out
