and i mean that question to others as well. i don't want to waste people's time with practical ideas for generating value if every idea is going to necessarily be too....too...already perspectival, or too already making a plan for action when the conditions have to be met in its emergence. i don't mean "waste time" as dramatically as it sounds, ha. i think with adventure capital i've had a hard time knowing where to point ye ol brain. is it helpful to lay out practical actionable scenarios or is it missing the point by imagining too much within the current mechanisms?
