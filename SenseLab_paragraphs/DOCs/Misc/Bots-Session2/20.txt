Wonderful stuff! Love so many things here. For me around all of this, I'm drawn to the dividual- individual differentials as they pertain to the threshold out of the magma. I'm can see how it might feel that way, but I think that the collective pull is strong outside of the intensity of the event, it's just that the pulls anarchivally transmute and transverse and are activated in intersecting differentials.
