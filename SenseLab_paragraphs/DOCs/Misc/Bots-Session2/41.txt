aha!!!! great to hear that moms are involved!!! YAY!!!
and I'm of course in agreement, Anique! Just trying to think out loud about what money brings and has brought to SenseLab/ECSA because we have some pragmatic experience with it and might want to learn from it! So I am not against money (I hope we make a lot of it!). My tendency is just to approach its value-system with caution! ;-)
