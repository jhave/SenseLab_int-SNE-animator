I've also been thinking that escrow could be a good instrument for us. Because it holds thing in potential upon conditions. And we get to set the conditions. It would make it (in terms of user design) a kind of delight to donate to (pardon the word) because folks want to see these bizzaro schizo-cultural conditions be met, conditions that are almost unmeetable. But I guess that puts money in the activating place again.
