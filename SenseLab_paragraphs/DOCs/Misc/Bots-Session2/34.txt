I'm still struggling with the derivative. This is a question I want to spend some time with in NY. On the one hand, my tendency is to see them as pure potential (because there is that side to them, particularly when discussed by Ayache and Robert). But both of them (and all the other writes) still see the derivatives as transactional. Is that because it's too hard to think potential outside of transaction (when it comes to finance)? This would be a way to perhaps get at what else money can do. One of my hesitations, Joel, as far as money is concerned, is that the footing is to damn uneven. In the event, footings are different but we can create the conditions for their coming together (through readings we do collectively, attuning to some singular vocabulary we can build on, or through sharing food etc). But for some of us (for me, say) money has little meaning. I have a lot of it - some gained, some lost won't make much of a difference. But for others it would be a great risk (like missing a meal, or not paying rent). And so the money would not be a mass it would be individualize whether we like it or not. And this is something I've even found myself doing (expecting more of folks who get more money, for instance, on the grant). It's such a habit to quantify money and to respond to it according to its measures of value. That's why I liked the idea of money coming in (as a mass) at a different end of the process. Would that not facilitate new capacitations? And would money then not feel more shared? Because if that could happen, the money couldn't be returned (even conceptually) to the sum of its parts.
