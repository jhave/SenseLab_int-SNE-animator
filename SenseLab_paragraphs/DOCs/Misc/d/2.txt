This text has been elaborated by cutting, pasting and re ordering (spatially and temporally) three specific laws subtracted from the Civil Code of Québec, that have the word “precariousness”(and derivates)in their sentences. Each page of the text reorganizes the sentences and words of one of the particular laws that are transcribed in their original form below. In the case of the first two laws a selection of the entire text has been made.
