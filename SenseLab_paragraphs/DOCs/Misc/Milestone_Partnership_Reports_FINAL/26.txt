Yes, we have had sufficient funds. The in-kind contributions from partners at the time of submission were higher than 35% (we requested $2.98 million from SSHRC and received 3.36 million in kind from institutional partner contributions and 1.5 million from community partner contributions). We have since added The School of Architecture at Aarhus University as a partner  (32 500 Euros/year) and are in the process of adding Usine C in Montreal, the University of Maine and the University of Milwaukee. We will be able to attain our objectives.
