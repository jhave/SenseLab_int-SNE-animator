•	Level of participation of the partnership team (researchers, partners, students, etc.) in the research project  
As mentioned above, most students, artists, post-docs and co-applicants have been extremely enthusiastic. We do have 2 co-applicants (Gerhald Raunig, Kim Halskov) who have not been very active during this period, but they have been invested in terms of creating opportunities for their students. One thing we will have to do as the grant progresses is secure more funding for new students. Partner institutions are already engaged in securing local grants to facilitate events, and I will write grant proposals in 2014 in an attempt to fund more students and to facilitate a research project touching on areas of interest adjacent to our project concerning current pedagogical models that challenge the neoliberalization of knowledge-formation in the university.
