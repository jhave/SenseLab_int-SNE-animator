Our 2013-2014 events culminated in 5 book proposals being prepared for the Open Humanities Book Series (out of 12 received so far); an issue of the SenseLab journal Inflexions entitled BioPhilosophy, and two off-series Inflexions issues entitled Into the Midst and Anarchiving: Precarity (www.inflexions.org). Participants delivered 169 Invited and Keynote Lectures related to the partnership and focusing on key research issues of the grant, and published 15 monographs, including Stamatia Portanova’s Moving without a Body. Digital Philosophy and Choreographic Thoughts (MIT Press 2013), Nathaniel Stern’s Interactive Art and Embodiment: The Implicit Body as Performance (London: Gylphi Limited, 2013), Anna Munster’s An Aesthesia of Networks: Conjunctive Experience in Art and Technology (MIT Press 2013); Erin Manning’s Always More Than One: Individuation’s Dance (Duke UP 2013); Ilona Hongisto’s forthcoming Soul of the Documentary: Expression and the Capture of the Real (Amsterdam University Press 2014); Erik Bordeleau’s Comment sauver le commun du communisme?
