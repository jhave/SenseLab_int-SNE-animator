In our research proposal, our aim for 2013-2014 was to implement “local programs of activities (reading groups, invited lectures, exploratory research-creation workshops, etc.).” With our lead hub named as Australia for the first two years, we wrote that “the emphasis of this first period will be on building conceptual vocabulary related to the experiential aspects of immediation, on solidifying the inter-university network of collaboration, and on launching the collaboration between university and community partners networkwide. Residencies for students, post-doctoral candidates and co-applicants will take place at Critical Path and Artspace in Sydney and Avoca Project in Melbourne in preparation for a network-wide colloquium in 2014 entitled "Recomposing Experience." All of these goals were met. Below I will describe the activities in detail.
