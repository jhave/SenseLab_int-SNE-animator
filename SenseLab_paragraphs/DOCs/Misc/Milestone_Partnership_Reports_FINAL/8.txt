•	Provide a high-quality research training experience for students
The students named in Part A all received funding from the Partnership Grant either directly from the SSHRC funds, or from our partners. The students, post-docs, visiting artists and visiting researchers were involved in all aspects of the research project including the organization of events, the editing of Inflexions issues, administration and editing tasks with the Open Humanities Book Series Immediations, the reading group (this includes an online reading group in Europe and another one in Australia, with cross-participation between hubs), the weekly movement experimentation workshop held at the SenseLab, the mobile cinema proposition, Movements of Thought, and Knots of Thought. A weekly writing activation workshop was also organized for the students (and by the students) to facilitate the writing of their dissertations/books, work in process was shared with the wider SenseLab and they were encouraged to apply to conferences, exhibitions and events both individually and collaboratively. Studio visits were also organized for the MFA students and were attended by members of the SenseLab. We hosted 11 residencies during this period, 6 of which were funded by the Partnership Grant. The influx of professors, students and artists infused the SenseLab with a collective enthusiasm that culminated in several new collaborations. A speaker series was organized for the presentation of research projects, workshops were organized for the presentation of movement research and short exhibitions were organized for the artists. Two large-scale performances occurred, the first entitled En Attendant (February 2014), the second Une Vie – Sous Influence (June 2014).
