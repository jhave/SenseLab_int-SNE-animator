We have used our grant proposal as the formal contract of activities and have held to our budget. We worked collectively on both these documents and see them as a binding formal structure. When changes need to be made, we set up videoconferencing meetings to discuss them. There have been no outstanding issues. Each hub's local program of activities is planned and conceived with close reference to the original project description. Hub activites are coordinated centrally through online writeboards (SenseLab grouphub), tri-weekly skype meetings, and events planned on the same dates for all three hubs and networked at a distance. The journal Inflexions and the Immediations book series at Open Humanities Press present publishing forums for the ongoing presentation of research results.
