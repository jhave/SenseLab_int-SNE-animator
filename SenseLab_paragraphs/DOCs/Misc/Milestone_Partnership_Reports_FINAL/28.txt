•	Overall effectiveness of the chosen partnership
Our approach works very well. Each of the co-applicants in the grant has a strong investment in the project and a real commitment to teaching, supervision, interdisciplinary research and collaboration. This means that we are able to add students on a continual basis, fostering a strong research-creation community. We spent several years planning the grant and wrote it according to our collective concerns. This not only means that we are all enthusiastic to follow through with the proposed activities, but that we are excited about the kind of knowledge that will grow from the activities and projects we proposed. The Year 1 three-hub event was a case in point. While we all began with “Recomposing Experience,” our research took us in three different but correlated directions, each of which was intimitely tied to local concerns. It is our wish to make the work we do relevant to local constituents even while addressing common pedagical, political and artistic concerns. The collated CVs from participants demonstrate how central our research questions are to everyone, students and artists included. Community partners have also benefitted from our event-structure, which has drawn publics to their institutions and has enlivened their own research focus. We will work closely with the Australia-based community partners during our 2-month event series in late 2014, benefiting from our partners Artspace, Critical Path and Avoca.
