Monthly video conferencing on Recomposing Experience with a focus on minor practices and research-creation. 
	•	Building Movements Workshop. This Melbourne gathering aimed to draw together a local (largely Melbourne-based) community to tentatively generate a shared ‘body of actions’. The event was organized to coincide with PhD candidate Scott Andrew Elliot’s Melbourne Immediations residency. We attended to the notion of constructed environments (buildings, clothes, landscapes, interiors…) as active participants in ecologies of lived experience. There was particular interest in how we can more explicitly approach our environments as spatial research devices, ie: how constructed environments can offer key questions and provocations in any research enquiry. The workshop had an open-ended format that allowed a group of creative practice researchers to take some collective steps toward the Immediations project, and toward the production of a substantial exhibition.
	•	Building Movements Exhibition. The exhibition was a direct outcome of the Building Movements workshop. Taking the building as a site for research and experimentation, Building Movements worked directly upon a new RMIT research facility: the Design Hub, Melbourne, Australia. Through installations, artworks, and performance this exhibition probed and played with aspects of the building in ways that interfered with habituated approaches we might otherwise (more automatically) entertain. 
	•	Minor Practices Workshop. This was a workshop for all Australian hub participants hosted by the National Institute for Experimental Arts, UNSW in Sydney. The purpose of the workshop was to develop a series of techniques loosely structured around the concept of ‘minor practices’ of listening and improvisation. These techniques will become the basis for a month-long series of events, symposia and exhibitions for all participants in the Immediations partnership during November and December 2014. The workshop also set aside a planning evening to discuss the involvement of community partners in hosting and planning the year-end events.
	•	Anarchiving: Precarity. The Australian hub participated in this event from Melbourne from April 25–27 at the Design Hub, RMIT. The event developed improvisation and listening techniques that began in the previous workshop (Minor Practices) and shared these with the Montreal and European hubs via video conferencing. Australian participants used these techniques in relation to texts and protocols received from the Montreal hub in order to generate new sets of video, audio, image and written material for ‘an archive’—that is, a living repository of the partnerships past, current and ongoing activities toward research-creation. This shared material will become the Australian hub’s ‘book’ contribution toward ‘anarchiving precarity’ and will be exhibited as part of the archive of the partnership’s activities during November and December 2014 in Australia.
