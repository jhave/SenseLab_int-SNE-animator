â€¢	Mobilize research knowledge
Mobilization of research knowledge was ensured through meetings on skype every three weeks between members of the partnership, through collaborations between members (for instance Toni Pape, Erin Manning, Erik Bordeleau, Adam Szymanski and Ronald Rose-Antoinette are working on an edited volume on the filmmaker Apichatpong and the concept of the intercessor; Toni Pape, Alanna Thain and Ilona Hongisto are working on an edited book coming out of the AbFab screening series; Erin Manning, Brian Massumi, Erik Bordeleau, Toni Pape, Ronald Rose-Antoinette, Adam Szymanski and Alanna Thain co-wrote an essay entitled "The Present Feeling: Contemporary Art and the Question of Time" for the 2014 Montreal Biennale Catalogue; Erin Manning and Nathaniel Stern collaborated on an installation for Glasshouse Project in NY; and Brian Massumi and Erin Manning co-wrote Thought in the Act: Passages in the Ecology of Experience). Several other artistic and research collaborations were seeded, including a double panel of papers and a workshop that will present results of partnership research at the Cultural Studies Association of Australasia at the University of Woollongong (Australia, 3-5 December 2014). Co-applicants of the partnership also gave a impressive number of invited and keynote lectures (169) in that period, several of which resulted in new members being added to the network.
