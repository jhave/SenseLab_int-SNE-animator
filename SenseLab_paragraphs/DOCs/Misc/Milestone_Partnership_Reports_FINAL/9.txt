•	Fund research expertise that relates to societal challenges and opportunities
In August 2013, Immediations organized and funded a 3-day event in Montreal entitled Bouffe sur trois bornes / Three Mile Meal for which we received quite a lot of press (Montreal Gazette, 24hr, Le Devoir, CIBL radio). The event was co-organized with our partner Design Studio for Social Intervention (Boston) and involved setting up 3 public kitchens in Outremont, Mile End and Parc Ex in Montreal. Each kitchen offered food made by local residents (the Hassidics in Outremont, the South Indians in Parc Ex and the SenseLab in Mile End) that was shared with the public in the hope of fostering a conversation about mobility and knowledge between different cultures in Montreal. We had three “Lack of Information Booths” where people were invited to share their lack of information. The goal was not to solve the lack, but to engage in ways to think of how the lack of understanding need not impede forms of collaboration between diverse communities. The ethos of this event, where the questions raised concerned how knowledge is crafted in the interstices of research and creation, is a key aspect of all of our activities.
