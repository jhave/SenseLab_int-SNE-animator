Governance has continued as proposed in the grant with Erin Manning and Brian Massumi as the directors of the project. In 2013-2014, other hubs were represented by Anna Munster (Australia), Christoph Brunner (Zurich) and Bodil Marie Thomsen Stavning (Denmark), with student participation by Toni Pape (Canada), Amelie Brisson-Darveau (Zurich) and Laura Lotti (Australia). This same governance structure will stay in place for 2014-2015, with the exception of Toni Pape, who has accepted a position at the University of Amsterdam, and will now become a co-applicant with the University of Amsterdam as an added partner. He will be replaced on the governing board by Adam Szymanski (Canada). As mentioned above, because of our long history of collaboration, the governing structure has posed no problems. We have not needed to formalize with protocols.
