As is apparent in the collated description of events, we are fully engaged in the project, working both collectively and individually in addressing the central question of our grant: how is knowledge crafted in the context of research-creation and how might that knowledge be evaluated? There has been no need to activate hubs â€“ everyone is extremely enthusiastic about having the opportunity to do this research and have moved seamlessly into project activities. The activities of the first year have been undertaken across the partnership with next year's research-creation events in November and December in Australia clearly in mind. This year's activities were designed to prepare the ground, organizationally and conceptually, for the 2014 Australia meetings. As foreseen in the original proposal, these meetings will bring members from all three hubs together on the ground for joint experimentation and sharing of research results.The aim will be to synthesize our collective thinking up to this point on the "Recomposing Experience" research theme, and articulate that theme to the "Anarchive" research theme which the partnership has been pursuing in tandem with "Recomposing Experience." We have already started work on one of our central projects: actually building an "anarchive." Our main concern as regards the anarchive at the moment involves the question of how knowledge and memory are integrated in experience, and how an event-based approach can challenge the idea of archive as (dead) repository. Following the Australia meetings, the respective hubs will continue local activities for the remainder of Year 2, building on the results and momentum generated.
