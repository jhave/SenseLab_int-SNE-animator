In the Canada/US hub, the activities include:
Daily interactions at the SenseLab and meetings by video conference with the whole network every three weeks. As set forth in the original proposal, the focus in 2013-2014 has been on Recomposing Experience through the concepts of research-creation, anarchiving, choreographing the social, and precarity. Weekly workshops involved moving between philosophy, artmaking and local interventions with the community. All activities were open to the public and students were highly encouraged to join. Activities included: 
	•	Screening Series Absolutely Fabulated. This monthly series approached the question of immediation by presenting documentary films that do not simply represent or ‘document’ a preexisting content but contribute to the creation of new realities. The central concept explored is that of fabulation, developed by philosophers Henri Bergson and Gilles Deleuze, understood as a creative relation between filmmaker, camera, ‘social actor,’ and the viewer.
	•	Knots of Thought; This bi-monthly series in collaboration with Usine C is a mode of working-thinking between disciplines that pushes us to make perceptible the captures, blockages, intercessions and interruptions in our academic and artistic projects. The invitation is to share these knots, not necessarily to unknot them, but to explore collectively how a knot gives texture to a project. How is a capture an opening? Might we say that all thought unfolds from knots? What is a knot of thought? What strategies have we taken to tighten or unravel these? How do we work from them, cut into them, and open out new ideas from their densities, into new intensities? In tandem with Movements of Thought, this series invites participants to explore the strange performances of knots of thought.
	•	Movements of Thought. This bi-monthly series in collaboration with Usine C considers ways of moving and thinking through embodied experience, and of thought itself as a mobile interplay across disciplines. What is a moving thought? How may it open bodies to modes of lived abstraction, becoming more-or-less human, comprising images, material entities, and affective compositions? What techniques may be drawn from diverse practices in physical movement, and how may these be assembled in discussion with scholars and practitioners from other fields? Working alongside Knots of Thought, this assembly of thinking-together invites participants to consider what may be at stake for performing an ecology of practices in movements of thought.
	•	Omegaville Project. This collaborative project, proposed by post-doc Michael Hornblow, offers a platform for interdisciplinary collaboration around critical perspectives on planetary urbanism. It seeks to enact a kind of speculative futurity for embodied praxis within everyday experience. These ideas are mobilised through a series of events, works, workshops and symposia, at the intersections of video, performance, sound, installation, mobile and interactive media. The project peers through the lens of Google Street View, via cross-platform media, to pose the question, How may we come to occupy infra/planetary bodies that are translocal and untimely, beyond the boundaries of skin and skull? How may this occupation occur through an ecology of practices that is political and ecological as much as social and technical?
	•	Brain, Self and Society. Founded by Dr Najmeh, Khalili Mahani in July 2013, and sponsored by the Senselab, this project is a knowledge-transfer group that gathers around "popular" neuroscience topics to discuss the philosophical, sociological and political implications of "Neurotalk" and "neuroeconomics." The meeting idea was inspired by the work of the prominent sociologist, Professor Nikolas Rose in the London School of Economics (currently heading the Department of Social Science, Health and Medicine at King’s College London), and is a response to the growing presence of the neurocentric discourse in different academic fields, as well as media and even economy.
	•	SenseLab Reading Group. Our ongoing reading group is held every three weeks and focuses on the close reading of philosophical texts. The conceptual exploration is tailored to the specific concerns of the partnership research, and actively informs the conception and design of partnership event and publications. The typical audience is 25-30 people. Open to the public.
	•	Research-creation for Social Justice Workshop in Boston. From the 17-19th of May 2013 select participants from the Senselab joined partners from the Design Studio For Social Intervention (DS4Si http://ds4si.org/)for a weekend workshop. Welcomed by partners Kenneth Bailey and Lori Lobenstine, the founding team at the DS4i members of the Senselab were introduced to the mission of DS4i, a collaborative design studio which seeks to provide communities, organizers and activists with unconventional design-based approaches to urban problem solving, enhancing community strength, youth work, and anti-violence campaigns. Our mandate for the event was to begin the planning toward the 2013 collaborative 3 Mile Meal event.
	•	Physical Lectures. SenseLab event-series in collaboration with the departments of Contemporary Dance, Studio Arts, Music and Theatre, Concordia University. The goal of the series is to experiment with the format of the lecture in order to foreground the presence of the body and the role of nonverbal registers of experience accompanying discourse. Rather than creating artificial bridges between processes of the physical diffusion and written publication of knowledge, "Physical Lectures" seeks to fold the articulation of both physical knowledge and theory into a cohesive physical-intellectual experience. 
	•	3 Mile Meal Research-Creation Event. The event was based on the idea that as neighbours and citizens, we often lack crucial information about each other and about issues that are pertinent to the built environments of urban spaces that we inhabit together. "3 Mile Meal "posited that finding common ground through shared time and space is more important than information exchange, and that finding common ground through shared activities can lead to future collaborations that can be fruitful in enhancing our understanding of each other. 
	•	Time Forms Research Event; “Time Forms: Temporalities of Aesthetic Experience” was a four-day major research-creation workshop that explored the ‘when’ of art today, held at McGill University and the Phi Centre in Montreal from September 18-21, 2013, curated by Eric Lewis (Philosophy), Stephen McAdams (Music Research) and Alanna Thain (English and World Cinemas) of McGill University. Bringing together scholars, artists, curators and the public, this event investigated art events that intimately involve a temporal dimension, in order to explore different concepts, kinds and components of temporality in the experiencing of art.  In exploring such questions as: ‘what concepts of time are relevant to the experience of art?’; ‘what are the ways in which time plays a role in such experiences?’ and ‘what qualities are specific to time-based arts?’, "Time Forms" addressed art today as a critical site for resisting the homogenization of a modern “clock time” that subdivides duration into discrete and identical units.  Do aesthetic experiences give us unusual experiences of time, and if so, how and to what end?  How does art “make time felt”?
	•	Anarchiving: Precarity. This event culminated from a weekly workshop entitled Inflexions-Making held at the SenseLab where the concept of material thinking was introduced. On the weekend of 25-27 April, members of the Senselab collective met in the Eastern Townships for the Anarchiving: Precarity event. This event was one phase in our collaborative work that as been ongoing since the Spring of 2013 on the question of how to make a collectively constructed issue on precarity in a way that engages artistic forms outside of the written word. This event was jointly organized with the European and Australian hubs and simultaneously took place in Montreal, Zurich and Melbourne.
	•	Inflexions. From 2012-2014, Inflexions has published two in-series issues, two out-of-series issues, and has initiated a third set of in-series and out of series issues to be published in 2015.
	•	Immediations Book Series, Open Humanities Press. The aim of the Immediations book series is to prolong the wonder sustaining philosophic thought into transdisciplinary encounters through the principle of co-composition. A number of these areas of interdisciplinary co-composition include: art practice, aesthetic theory, political theory, movement practice, media theory, maker culture, science studies, architecture, and philosophy. We invite authors to roam it, and the first six books that we have scheduled for publication traverse these various approaches and disciplines.
