2. Describe any successes or challenges related to the partnership 
Since the core of the partnership has worked together for more than 10 years, we have had an extended period to attend to the challenges of communicating across such a wide network. No new challenges were noted. We continue of course to be challenged by the time difference (a skype conversation between Australia, Europe and Canada usually means the middle of the night for one party!) but this has also had the positive effect of encouraging the hubs to become independent as regards the organization of their own events, workshops, reading groups and to use our online hub (Basecamp). This local/global approach is further facilitated by students, artists and visiting researchers traveling between hubs (benefiting from the expertise of professors across the network).
