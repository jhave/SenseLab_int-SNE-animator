We held research-creation events in Montreal, Zurich, Denmark, Sydney, Melbourne and Boston [see Appendix 1 for documentation on these and other events for the 2013-2014 period]. Participants in the events included partners and co-applicants, as well as postdoctoral researchers [Erik Bordeleau (Canada), Toni Pape (Canada), Virginia Preston (Canada), Eldritch Priest (Canada), Louise Boisclair (Canada), Troy Rhoades (Canada), Ilona Hongisto (Finland), Stamatia Portanova (Italy), Katva-Kaisa Konturri (Finland), Michael Hornblow (New Zealand)], visiting artists [Maud Watel (France), Amelie Brisson-Darveau (Canada), Justy Phillips (Australia), Ally Bisshop (Australia)] students [(Mayra Morales (Concordia), Diego Gil (Concordia), Adam Szymanski (Concordia), Ana Ramos (U of Montreal), Andrew Goodman (Monash), Ronald Rose-Antoinette (Paris 8)] and visiting researchers [Soren Rasmussen (Aarhus U), Peter Weibrecht (Aarhus U), Ulla Vilhelm (Aarhus), Kaspar Levin (Copenhagen U) Rainer Mühlhoff (FU Berlin)]. These events also served to expand our network. New partners and co-applicants are currently being added to the grant in addition to those already added in 2013-2014). In 2013, Annette Svaneklink Jakobsen from Aarhus University, Denmark, was added as co-applicant and the School of Architecture at Aarhus University was added as partner. Currently underway we have the addition of Nathaniel Stern (US), Bianca Scliar (Brazil), Toni Pape (Netherlands) as co-applicants and Usine C (Canada), the University of Maine, the University of Milwaukee, the University of Amsterdam, and Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul as partners.
