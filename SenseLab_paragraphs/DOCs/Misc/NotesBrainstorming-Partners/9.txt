Mayra:
-shadowing technique
-idea of festival of all sorts with informality : a project that have to create something and challenge the notion of presentation to the public
– Timeframe proposed : March 2016 as the Launch of the festival and May 2016: Launch of Inflexions 9
-make paires between people to think about a project from a tittle chose by chance. Maybe way of challenging the notion of festival and performance
-set up a pairing with a partner
-alternative modes of festival (suggested reading of Murphie's piece on Performance)
-how do we create together?
-SenseLab as a place of making and studio practice – Ask people to come with a material 
-how do we reach the partners from within?
