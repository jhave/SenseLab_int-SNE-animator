-how to share a process – suggest close reading of Andrew Murphie's Clone your Technic and Alanna's intro to Inflexion No. 1, in relation to this question. If we are interested in 'selling the process' of Immediations to the partners, then 'how to share a process'  is a good place to start. 	
Murphie argues  for the sharing of technique, as the intricacies and nuances of a research process can not be described – they must me felt through directly engaging that practice. The first questions one usually gets are 'what did you do' and then 'how did you do that'. By sharing an cloning your techniques in a way that can be distributed in the world, we allows others to take up the 'how' of that research process  --- something that also touches on 'seeding a process' propositions and the anarchive.
--Explore not just what a partnership can be, but the how of a partnership - can we invent our own system of valuation for working with and engaging the partners, beyond normative frameworks of supply/demand of a service etc. Can we invent this is with the partners, through techniques of immediations, rather then from the outset ? Could 'knots of thought' be used as a potential technique for entering into those questions -- feeding off of csenge's potluck propositions at usine c, can we craft invitations that can activate co-composing forces with the partners, that foreground the“minor”of our relation, in a way that can be crafted into future ongoing practices and events? 
Could we think through 'minor' encounters, as well as 'major' planned events? --- the idea of inviting partners to stop by the 'studio' at senselab touches on this, or an already moving and aroundness, that allows for intersections and transversal emergences --- Mayra suggesting even as simple as running into them at a café
-treat techniques developed within senselab at reading group or other events as rigorous, and not disposable in the face of meeting a 'deliverable' or working with a 'public'. Again, how to work from the perspective of the event. Inflexions is an minor example of how we can work within delivery framework and publics, while developing and honouring techniques of research creation and the ethics/values immanent to that thinking/making.
