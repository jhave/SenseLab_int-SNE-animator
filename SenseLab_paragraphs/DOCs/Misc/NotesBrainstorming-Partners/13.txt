- suggest that we have readings to accompany each of our meetings, to establish some shared vocabulary around certain concepts guiding our work within Immediations, in relation to the partners. Treat this a technique that brings rigour to the discussion, and more clarity to the how of 'study', 'the event', 'techniques of research creation', radical pedagogy, fugitive planning etc, and what that means in relation to generating new forms of value, immanent to Immediations work in relation to the partners.
