Joel:
-Festival melting – kind of public gathering  (maybe spring 2016 with Usine C) - with Mayra, perhaps techniques aiming at the ‘anarchic informal’.
- small senselab/partner events: pairing someone from senselab with someone from partner institution introduce a walking technique to a group within public space, exploring the multiplicity of walking practices (at least 3 people I can think of that have active walking practices). benefit of walking to “selling the process” is its decentralization of either ‘culture’ of SL or partner institution, allowing an interstitial space to form in the movement.
	- Exploring the city and the different sites of the partners
-Launch of Inflexions 9 (April-May 2016) with a public face and hospitality (acknowledging that there will be many ‘launches,’ just wanting one that pseudo-narrativizes a solidity, embracing the unintelligibility of ‘perceived intelligibility’ - a place where conviviality and opening of process make a more gracious power-dynamic where everyone from different cultures can potentially land together or in corresponding rhythms.
-notion of non-performance-performance (Panoply Performance Lab, Brooklyn). Techniques of non-performance from different practices introduced/studied/played with as autonomous contagions (performance art, etc).
