Now, I’d like to show you that the fertile consequence of this image-proposition of life is permissive or enabling; and that art, any form of art is—in continuity with its actual existence—the transducer of a per-formative, redundant, excessive, superfluous capacity or activity. Art has an infinite patience for what supersedes it, for its superjective reality. It is inclusive, even in its most abstract instances, of what Whitehead calls « a feeling », a decisive element, an activity, that is a « generic operation » both procuring and violating its forms, even its most complex, structured ones. The object is not important (nor what it means). Its performativity is: the art, the life, the feeling it produces and transduces.
