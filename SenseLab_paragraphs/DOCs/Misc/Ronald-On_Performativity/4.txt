The world is propositional in the sense that it actively produces its own truth. It is at once what Whitehead describes as a « datum » or a « lure for feeling » (1978: 259), a reality whose mode of existence cannot be but experimented or felt in its effects, and the name for what « is made, just as health, wealth, and strengh are made, in the course of experience » (1907: 143), as William James would say. Propositions are meaningful insofar they have been experimented, lived, in-formed and transformed.
