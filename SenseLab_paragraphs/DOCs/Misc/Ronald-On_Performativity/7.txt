My thesis now is this: that, when we think of the power of life as a Nature-Schize, a cutting force, we are not required to think of biological life only; we are entitled also to consider non-traditional, unlivable lives and hold to their necessities. For, we are not properly thinking the speculative if we are not ready yet to feel the impossible, to feel the unlivable which forces us to live, which forces us to think, if we are not ready yet to think at the limit: the proto-aesthetico-political force of a life modulating all forms of life and their existential and enunciative modalities. And the next thing in order for me is to make plain to you why it has in its infra-empirical logic no deterent, though very influential, power, but a rather formative, constitutive one. Life, after all, is already a praxis, a pragmatism, a doing, it is, in and of itself, performative of the present (laboratory). Here, I express this idea in terms singularly close to those of William James’s radical empiricism and Gilles Deleuze’s « powerful non-organic life. » The technical question for us remains: how to perform the performative (what’s already doing)?; how to perform the speculative, that is, par excellence, non-economical (partial, unadjustable, anarchic sympathy)? These questions cannot be problematized and pushed to their limits if we don’t immediately acknowledge, in a very pragmatic way, that something is already at work in what we tend to claim as our present, however clear and distinct it might look to us; if we don’t fully and loudly acknowledge the indeterminacy, the untimeliness cleaving, life-cleaving those moments of our lives when we convice ourselves that no movement is actually possible. Thus, just as we face forward to the zone of ignorance immanent to the present, we don’t know yet what a body can perform, we don’t know yet to what extent it can be affected by the performative force of an original life, of an intensive and primordial appetition. And since it is primordial, « there is nothing to preserve, » (1978: 105) there is nothing to be left unchanged, fixed or stable, but the aftermath, the symptoms of its power of variation (Tarde).
