Pragmatism isn’t descriptive of the facts, but rather participates in their emergence, in their addition to reality. From a pragmatist standpoint, to the question « who is doing what? » the answer is always an intensity, an emergent reality. It is important to re-frame the problem at the level of the processual that we are experiencing, to move from an ontology of an individuated state of being to an ontogenesis of a primordial operation of individuation, or what I have decided to term here as a movement of trans-apparition. The trans-apparitional is the operation through which a phenomenon is made a phenomenon, it is the urge toward new forms and modes of experience; for there is no such thing as a finished appearance. It is more than what is here. The trans-apparitional only exists in the intensive mode of the problematic, of the dramatic. Not as a thing nor a being. It exists in the making, in an operative and sympathetic mode (cutting-off, decisional force). Trans-apparitional thought is the principle at stake in a pragmatic assemblage or agencement, in which each and every art-form necessarily implicates its own regime of individuation, its own situational potential, is referent to its own passion or appetition. Just as there is a meliorative « art of life », as Alfred N. Whitehead suggests, there is a speculative life in art that needs to be disclosed or felt in its effects. Trans-apparition is at once pragmatic and speculative. Never enough.
