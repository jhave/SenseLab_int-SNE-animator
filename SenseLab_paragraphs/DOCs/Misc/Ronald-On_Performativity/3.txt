In order to expand on the indefiniteness of our response, and for the purposes of my argument, I wish to adopt a pragmatic and speculative approach, with no possibility of restriction. During this quarter of an hour I wish you also to accept it as a postulate, whether you think it incontrovertibly true or not; so I urge you to agree with me today in suscribing very quickly to the following: that the performative body is both the score and the composer of a more primitive and less definite experience, of a trans-situational performativity. 
  
But before going into the micro-implications of my proposition, let me say a few words about the pragmatic approach adopted here. I’d also like you to adhere to William James’s definition of pragmatism, in contradistinction to rationalism: « The essential contrast, he says, is that for rationalism reality is ready-made and complete from all eternity, while for pragmatism it is still in the making, and awaits part of its complexion from the future. » (1907: 167) The word « future », here, is merely referent to the per-formative dimension of reality, to its imminent capacity to constitute itself, to appear—though in an anexact way—as a determination in the phenomenal order or plane of existence. Which is why, to quote Alfred N. Whitehead, « the imperfection of the world is the theme of every religion which offers a way of escape, and of every sceptic who deplores the prevailing superstitions. » (1978: 47) The futurity and incompleteness of the world are the nutrients of our own beliefs. Whatever exists keeps lurking in the interstices provided by the untimely, the limit to our thinking and making processes.
