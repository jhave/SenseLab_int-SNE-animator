The latent capacity of the present is inexhaustible. Its existence is in the mode of an energetic, trans-formative politicality. Politicality, here, has to be understood in tandem with potentiality, a capacity to generate new collectivities. Thus, the pragmatic questions that I would like us to think about this morning can be expressed as such: How to experiment it? How can we all co-compose with it, both with and beyond our body enveloppes? The answers are as indefinite and speculative as the virtuality of the present. Speculative because experience is necessarily beyond our economical and representational modes of perception. Monstruous indeed. What Iâ€™m advocating here for is not the usefulness (economicaly oriented), but rather the artful experimentations with the politicality already active and operative in the present.
