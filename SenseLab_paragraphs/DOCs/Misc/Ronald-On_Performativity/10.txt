The irrational force of a feeling is over and above law, it is the real Nature and Schize cutting off most of the en route or impending narratives. Even life when saying « yes » means « no » to most of our volitions and economical calculations. Enough of the enough. This, then, extends my objection to the general belief that the force of art is reducible to its mere sensible, carnal and textural existence. But it is our duty to fight this common truism and fully acknowledge the politicality and performativity at the heart of any artistic practice and cartography of the present. That politicality is not yet in the mode of a possible formation. It is not yet possessed nor excerted as a power over life and its forms of existence. It cannot be represented ; and it represents nothing. Yet, it is more than a thing. We cannot but suspect any correlation between the trans/per/formative capacity of life and the material and immaterial properties possessed by an individual or a group of individuals. It is no longer useful to ask what properties or phenomenal traits actual entities endorse or possess, if they are constantly and forcefully dis-possessed by the performative dimension of life. « Life, as Alfred N. Whitehead once said, is robbery » (1978: 105). And that’s the real cruelty. « It is the name for originality, not for tradition » ; « It is the clutch at vivid immediacy. » (1978: 104-105). A thinking or a philosophy of experience cannot be of nor about possessions, nor it can be in accordance with a doctrine of the preservation of the self, for, as we have already implied, neither things nor beings can remain as such, can be taken for facts or phenomenons. « Experience, as we know, has ways of boiling over, and making us correct our formulas. » (James 1907: 145) « So far as reality means experienceable reality, both it and the truths men gain about it are everlastingly in process of mutation—mutation towards a definite goal, it may be—but still mutation. » (1907: 146)
