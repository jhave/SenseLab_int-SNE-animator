The power of a life/art exceeds its own forms and possible modes of existence. Its immortality is not in imagination, it is as objectively real as its sensations. It is not a gesture for life nor on life, but of and along with it, a trans-apparition you might even sayÂ ; not only for those who are here and now, but also for those whose modes of existence are yet to be invented, recruited, lived and joyfuly experimented. What is not yet or no longer actual (surviving or superliving in the present) is still dressed with importance, still part of experience, although beyond our direct observation. The moment we inquire more closely into the power of life and its capacity to traverse all effective, in-act realities, body-images, things and beings, we immediately perceive experience in a more complex way: without any primary distinction, not yet full of objects, neither of subjects, as a per-forming, antipredicative experience; and so our essential, positivist certitudes about what the world is wither as soon as we realize it is still in its emergent, nascent phase.
