During the Undercommons events (July-August 2015), we suggested a decolonial experiment with literature. We brought literature (and writing practices) to the SenseLab because literature seems to be a decolonial procedure. It acts counter centralization, straightforwardness, and identity politics and imposes a border-thinking, an ambiguous and situational positioning, as the ones that are invoked by the decolonial epistemology. 
Gerko read and commented texts in German, Érik in French, Laura T. Ilea in Romanian. Darine Ameyed and Hanen Hattab brought some Arabic literature, Anique Australian texts. As a common basis of discussion, we had a paragraph from "Learning to Unlearn: Decolonial Reflections from Eurasia and the Americas” and two chapters from a book written by Nancy Huston, "The Tale Tellers. A Short Study of Humankind," in which she diagnoses human consciousness as an innately tale-telling one.
