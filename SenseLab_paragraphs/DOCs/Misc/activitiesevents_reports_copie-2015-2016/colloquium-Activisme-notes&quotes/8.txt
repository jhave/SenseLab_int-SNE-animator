By entangling our [conversation] process we seek not the method, but a way open to the eventfulness and artfulness of what cuts and intersects with the more-than of everyday life â€“ sites and encounters that invent their own techniques for study within the rhythms of the world and not solely within the walls of a classroom called-to-order. We seek techniques for thoughts to land and take off. We seek both openness and dissent (think of all the words that have been cut, displaced, taken out, for this sentence to appear as it does). By entangling our writing [thinking-together?] process, we seek to create the conditions for this way to germinate.
