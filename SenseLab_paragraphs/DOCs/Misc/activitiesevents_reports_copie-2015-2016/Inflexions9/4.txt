A call for works of art and/or philosophy that feel (or exist at) the friction point of two urgencies: the need for immediate macro-material, perceptible, collective political change (as exhibited in student strike activism in Quebec, Black Lives Matter in the U.S., Blackfulla in Australia, and Idle No More in Canada, among many others) and the need for micro-material, processual, and often imperceptible anarchic tendings of an already swarming political affect, a coming together beneath recognized political forms (as developed most recently by Stefano Harney and Fred Moten in The Undercommons and less recently in Deleuze and Guattari’s A Thousand Plateaus).  Submissions do not have to be limited to the examples above but can touch on any events in which the corporeality of the political is felt and put into question towards a further reshaping of its form. We understand “frictions” as the manners of grasping the concretisation of a political struggle and “fictions” as their aesthetic and theoretic propositions that overspill towards the more-than-concrete, diagramming alternative trajectories of thought and feeling.
