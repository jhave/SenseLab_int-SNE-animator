Laura T. Ilea’s talk, entitled “The Seduction of Barbarism. About Decolonial Thinking” was interested in re-inscribing subaltern knowledge in contemporary debate. It responds to stories that avoid a conception of history seen as a linear succession of events performed and narrated from the perspective of those agents who control knowledge. It made reference to Rodolfo Kusch’s Indigenous and Popular Thinking in America, analyzing some of the main debates in Madina Tlostanova and Walter D. Mignolo’s Learning to Unlearn: Decolonial Reflections from Eurasia and the Americas. It could be put in relation with other events dedicated to decolonial perspectives, expressed in Radical Pedagogies Inflexions 8 issue, in the September 2015 Conference on “Rethinking Politics” and in the August 2015 event entitled “Decolonial Experiments with Literature”.
Juan Pablo Anaya’s talk was entitled Masochistic Humor in Kafka’s ‘Letter to His Father’ and inquired on the one hand the relationship between humor and masochism. On the other hand, it asked in what sense is a masochistic humor present in Kafka's “Letter to his father”?
