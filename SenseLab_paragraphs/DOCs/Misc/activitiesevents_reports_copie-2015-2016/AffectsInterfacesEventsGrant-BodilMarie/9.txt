Description of the Activity: 
The activity consisted in a close reading seminar day to which all the research group members of Affects, Interfaces, Events, had prepared themselves by reading one text by Andrew Murphie, one text by Lone Bertelsen and one collaborative text by Murphie and Bertelsen. Two of those texts were produced within the framework of Immediations: Media, Art, Event. The Q & A section was followed by an expanded discussion on the concepts ‘affect’ and ‘event’ in relation to the sub-projects. It was decided that this collaborative reading should be followed by more readings and seminars with Bertelsen and Murphie and more Immediations-partners in the future.
