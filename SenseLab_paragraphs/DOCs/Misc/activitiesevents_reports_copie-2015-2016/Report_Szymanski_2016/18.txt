The conference paper at the University of Montreal explores the concept of therapeutic political aesthetics, particularly in the context of Indigenous cinema. The notion of the therapeutically political also appears in the talk on plastics and potential at the University of Amsterdam. The concept is presently being expounded through conference talks and workshops, and will form the an important current in the forthcoming 2017 issue of Inflexions on the politics of therapy and exhaustion, through which I will disseminate this research. This relates directly to the Immediations grant theme of Recomposing Experience, which deals with how experiential states are transduced through art and made aesthetic.
