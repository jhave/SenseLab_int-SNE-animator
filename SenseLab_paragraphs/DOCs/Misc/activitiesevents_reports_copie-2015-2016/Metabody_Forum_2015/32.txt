Metakinesphere is an analogue prototype for interactive/intra-active wearable architecture. A wearable structure made of flexible materials and translucent textiles that blurs the limits of the body and its legibility. A metabody, a body-space without recognisable form or function, that physically transforms in an elastic relation to bodily movement, bound by elastics to the “human” body which moves suspended in the relation to the architecture, while projecting its skin on the textiles through cameras placed on the skin and projecting the electronically processed voice. Metakinesphere challenges the reducibility of the body and its movement to any spherical or geometric form (Laban, Parmenides, or Leonardos Vitruvian man). Never aquiring a form, movement unfolds in indeterminate potentials. Hybrid of architecture, wearable and textile, this metabody is enacted as movement, metaformed and performed, an anti-object in permanent amorphogenesis. Alien bride and posthuman cocoon, it is also an hommage to the amorphogeneitc multisensorial performances of dancescientist Loïe Fuller.
