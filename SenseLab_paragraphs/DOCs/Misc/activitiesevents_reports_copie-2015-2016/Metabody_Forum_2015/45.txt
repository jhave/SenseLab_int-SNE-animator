Microsexes is a Metaformance â€“ ongoing process of transformation of perception - in which surveillance cameras placed on the skin become the eyes of the body, undoing the usual perceptual framing and with it the conditions of possibility of form and identity. The body becomes an amorphogenetic process of becoming, an unravelling of endless microsexes that defy binary and morphological construcionts of sex. JaiVal is an alien preacher, a microsex worker that disseminates posthuman affects through postintimate encounters for an ecology to come.
