Description of the Activity: The principle activity of the post-doctoral research is the preparation of 
A book manuscript (Gathering Ecologies : Thinking Beyond Interactivity) for the Immediations book series with OHP.  The book investigates the concept of an immediated rather than mediated experience in interactive art through three key concepts that relate to the concept of immediation : feeling (Whitehead), transduction (Simondon and the parasite (Serres), in order to expand interactivity. The research is framed within a research-creation framework.
Other related activities (described in separate reports) include : presentation of versions of manuscript chapters at 2 conferences, Senselab residency in July 2015 ; development of a book chapter for the Immediations anthology ; participation in Senselab reading groups ; gallery presentation of two artworks investigating concepts around force and transduction.
