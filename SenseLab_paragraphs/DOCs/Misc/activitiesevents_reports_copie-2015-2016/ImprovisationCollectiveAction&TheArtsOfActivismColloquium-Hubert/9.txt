Description of the Activity : SenseLab members proposed « Launching and landing », a workshop based on the relation between movement, thinking and improvisation. The workshop offerred an interesting platform for people to participate physically in a performance space, which is really original in the traditional space of a colloquium. Some techniques were tried there, some with greater success than others.
