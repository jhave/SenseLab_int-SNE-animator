Description of the Activity: 
A seminar on texture explored from theoretical and artistic points of view. The goal of the seminar was to generate a conceptual foundation of what texture in an urban context might mean. In a second step we used a mobile research developed by Am√©lie Brisson-Darveau and Christoph Brunner to investigate urban textures in Zurich and Hong Kong. The visit with students to Hong Hong included collaborations with Shannon Walsh from Hong Kong City University and Yanki Lee from Hong Kong School of Design and culminated in a collaborative exhibition.
