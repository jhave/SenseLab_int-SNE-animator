Description of the Activity: 
The Berlin-event was a continuation of previous research-creation activities and experiments carried out across Immediation hubs and events around the notion of the anarchive. It brought together different approaches to anarchiving which had been experimented with e.g. in Montr√©al and in a prior EU Hub event the same year at Mols/Aarhus. Working within the overall frame of the anarchive the workshop-seminar also explored how emissaries from other hubs can engage in and transform the activities set in motion. In addition, the event involved a number of students into the discussions and activities whom actively contributed to the unfolding of the event.
