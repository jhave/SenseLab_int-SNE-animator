Description of the Activity: 
Continuation and reflection of the first collaborative seminar at HZT in November 2015. The goal was to intensify anarchival practices and to generate stronger ties amongst the different research hubs in Canada, Europe and Australia. The research meeting defines a concrete follow-up including anarchival materials from the earlier EU-Hub meeting in Berlin. Practices, techniques and materials were received from Montreal and tested in a new environment and then sent back with parts of the research outcomes.
