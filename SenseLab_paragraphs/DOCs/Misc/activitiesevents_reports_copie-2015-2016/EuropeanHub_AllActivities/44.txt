The Ph.d. project is part of a Danish research group (AIE) working with Immediations-related topics and practices on an ongoing basis, and continously taking part in Immediations activities allows for the project to feed from and into future Immediations work. With interaction design and innovative design processes as a point of departure the project investigates the affective role of archives and (an)archival practices and techniques for affective relaying of collective events when designing technology. Building and experimenting with technologies able to capture, but not withhold, innovative processes the project activily investigates the role of research-creation in a participatory design context.
