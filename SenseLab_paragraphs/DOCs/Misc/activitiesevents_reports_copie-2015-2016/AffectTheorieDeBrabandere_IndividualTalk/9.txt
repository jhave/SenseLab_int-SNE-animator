Description of the Activity: The research presented during the talk developed from Stefano Harney and Fred Moten's 'The Undercommons', a text that was discussed at length by the Senselab over the course of the Undercommons event in July, 2015. The research that I presented at the conference took the form of a hybrid format, involving theoretical, poetic, material and video experiments. The combination of theoretical and poetic improvisation was largely influenced by the Undercommons text. I have since published a version of the presented talk in the Journal for Artistic Research https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/134510/134511 under the same title: 'Sticky Currents: Drawing Folds in Serial Exhaustion'. This research was also influenced by my participation in two earlier Immediations events in 2014 (Adapt-r, Brussels and the Un-conference, Geneva) where I collaborated with Senselab participants Am√©lie Brisson-Darveau and Christoph Brunner. I am further developing this research towards part of my PhD thesis at the Zurich University of the Arts.
