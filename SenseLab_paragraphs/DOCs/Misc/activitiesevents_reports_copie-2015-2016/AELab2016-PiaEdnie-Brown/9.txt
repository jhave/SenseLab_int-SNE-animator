Description of the Activity: 100-250 words. 
The AELab is an emergent creative practice research collective based in Melbourne, Australia, developed as part of the Immediations project. Core participants are staff and PhD candidates at RMIT University, with a wider involvement across other partner universities and senselab practitioners/academics.
In 2014/15 a web site was produced to provide an armature for the AELab. Initially called the Affective Environments Lab, renamed the ‘Architectural Ecologies Lab’ in 2016, the group is now moving to expand the acronym, AELab to refer to multiple simultaneous names : Affective Environments Lab, Architectural Ecologies Lab, Atmospheric Emergence Lab, Aesthetic Ethics Lab, and Almost Everything Lab. This multiplication of ‘name’ is an important part of the developmental trajectory, as it enables (paradoxically) a more precise description of the research emphasis, which concerns exploration of architectural and other environments as active participants in the ecological collectivity of events, motivated and informed by an ethics of vital materialism (after Jane Bennett). 
Formal events were held in February and May 2015. The Avery Green project became the primary AELab project for 2015/16 and two new Immediations related projects are currently being planned for 2016/17, along with a renewal of the web site.  A paper concerning the 2013 project Building Movements, was published in the Radical Pedagogies issue of Inflexions journal.
