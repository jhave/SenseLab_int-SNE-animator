Community Partners Involved (if applicable): None but this was funded by another SSHRC grant, on which I am a Co-Applicant for 2015-2016. This is an SSHRC Connection grant, “New Materialisms and Educational Research”, with PI Stephanie Springgay. Lone Bertelsen and I were able to invite Stephanie for an 18 month residency in the School of the Arts and Media at UNSW via the network of Senselab.
