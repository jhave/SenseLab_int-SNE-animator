Axiom I.
Gravity keeps me out from drifting to the moon. 
The force of imagination makes me walk on the moon. 
My motivation makes me draw the moon. 
My association sees the smile from a sickle moon. 
And yet my molecules cannot let me be the moon. 
Thankfully gravity lets the moon follow me on earth.
