I don't know how long I have to wait
No I am a person of punctuality 
I know that I like sentences and when people meet they talk in sentences 
I must applaud
The key is to learn from anything like the floor and walls 
I think every thing has to teach us something
 I believe in pan psychism 
That even a stone can think 
The brain for me can be just an atom for the stone 
Spinoza
I am rereading Ishmael 
I am wondering about the stillness of the unending ultimate end called death 
It is the beginning before it all began
The movement of life is just the temporary stage 
I just see how it all began 
The stone is the ultimate rest and I am ignoring the weathering 
You got it 
When the ambition ceases to move that is what stillness of stone like the absolute zero 
Knowing and yet not needing to tell is learning from the stone 
That is Hobbs social contract 
I reached my mathematics threshold when it became visual 
I simply liked the auditory design in the arrangement of the last line in each stanza
