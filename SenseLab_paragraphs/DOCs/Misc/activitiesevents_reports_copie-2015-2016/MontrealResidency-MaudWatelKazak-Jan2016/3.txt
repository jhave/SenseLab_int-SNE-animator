In the same way and in order to continue the partnership with the SenseLab, I wanted to come back and experiment in Montreal new performances and workshops, because I’m still working on transdisciplinary performance that mix theater, music and video. My last work was created in Paris during all the year 2015 and combined in a transdiciplinary play Jasam Van Sebe, theater, music and video. This new residency was the occasion to still have a link with the SenseLab’s members I knew and discover new members and think together about topics, have exchanges and why not develop a new proposition of performance. 
First I proposed with the teacher in Art department Matthew Robin Wright a workshop around the interaction between Performing Arts, specially the performative works including the connexion between theater and music. I developed a work’s proposition with the Students of media art in the Concordia University of Montreal. I started with them to work improvised theater exercises, then to learn to move with some musical tunes together and finally to try to compose a chorus. I involved for the last part of the workshop some extracts from the Euripides’ play Bacchae playing on body and voice experimentations. This work was quiet new for them. They were not used to practice theatre exercises and to explore voices and bodies possibilities. They were used to work alone in their art practice and not mix body language with music, video and text languages. In that way, I’m pretty satisfied to be able to try something new with them and compose with non-actors a staging proposition.
