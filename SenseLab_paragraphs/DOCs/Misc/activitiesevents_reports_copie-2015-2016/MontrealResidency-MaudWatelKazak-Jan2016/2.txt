I realized thanks to the SenseLab a new residency in Montreal from the 7th of January to the 3rd of February 2016. This was my third experience with the SenseLab in Montreal. I already had two residencies as guest artist in 2014: 
First one on January-February where I worked from the Samuel Beckett’s play Waiting for Godot with the collaboration of the SenseLab’s members and artists from Montreal. We accomplished a huge interactive and spontaneous performance at the top of Mont Royal (Belvedere) who combined musicians, performers and audience.
Second one on June where we built with SenseLab’s members a Street Opera: Une vie sous influences, freely adapted from the Ronald Rose Antoinette’s novel. We performed in the Gallery Articule; the proposition was ambulatory, from the Street to the gallery, and combined music, theater and video’s creations.
