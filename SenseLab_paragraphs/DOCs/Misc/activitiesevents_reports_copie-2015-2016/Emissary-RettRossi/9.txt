Description of the Activity: the first ripple of activity included research, preparation and development of environments conducive to neurodiversity in events; direct work with SenseLab during the two specific events (including a close reading of Tito Mukhopadhyay's Plankton Dreams, published within the Immediations Book Series), formal and informal discussions, documentation (incl. creation of several sketches exploring 'broader bandwidth perception'). These activities rippled into my surrounding (both before and after these events), disseminating and exploring insights, methods and approaches with others interested in techniques for neurodiversity (e.g., Frauke Ebert and Stefanie von Schnurbein - HU Berlin, Bettina Knaup - Berlin/New York), preparing for even further emissary ripples anarchiving neurodiversity techniques in a project proposed for late April-early May 2016 near Tisvilde, Denmark. The ripples are further fed through continued collaboration with SenseLabbers (e.g., Csenge Kolszvari, Leslie Plumb, Mayra Morales and Zehorith Mitz) regarding anarchival practices and TfN.
