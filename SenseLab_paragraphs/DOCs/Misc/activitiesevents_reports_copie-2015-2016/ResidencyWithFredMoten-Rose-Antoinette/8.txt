After the event around our reading of The Undercommons last summer, we felt the need to figure how to prolong and sustain the wondering curiosity that is about study through a poetics of life. Ronald Rose-Antoinette whose writing and other practices are moved by a similar quest(ion), contacted Fred Moten (currently teaching at Riverside) to know if he would be interested in  creating an anarchive translating a poetics of life. More specifically, in less than two weeks, Rose-Antoinette attended Moten’s seminars at Riverside (« New Alternative Delivery Systems for Poetry » and « Seminar in Genres—Paraliterature: Samuel R. Delany’s Return to Neveryon ») as a way to begin exploring the social poeisis of writing.
