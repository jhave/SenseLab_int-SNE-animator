In addition, both Moten and Rose-Antoinette met outside the university, at various occasions, not only to think about poetry, philosophy and language as life-making procedures, but also to activate a poetics of affective attunement that conditions events around what a life can doâ€”in other words, to make stuff. They sat down and wrote together, met with other artists in the region, and decided to continue their collaboration either in the form of writing, or in through the organizing of events, workshops where poetry would have to be made and transferred.
