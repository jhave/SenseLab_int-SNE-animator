- Judith Leemann and Joel Mason: an encounter on radio and on the street. From one side, a felted text, passages of others writings stripped of their citational armor; from another side, a classical guitar given to a son by a father after the father loses his ability to play because of a stroke. Playing and reading simultaneously, Inherited Instruments is both drawing out and thwarting the other's best loved way of sounding themselves. This propulsion happened within Laura Acosta's Poe Radio piece currently on exhibition as part of Visitations. Visitations is a collaborative exhibition with Matthew-Robin Nye, Jacinthe Loranger, and Laura Acosta running until August 20th at the FOFA Gallery in downtown Montréal.
