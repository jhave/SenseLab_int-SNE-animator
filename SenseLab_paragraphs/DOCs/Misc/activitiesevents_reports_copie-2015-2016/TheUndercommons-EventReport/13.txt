Mike Hornblow, Bianca Scliar, Matthew Robin-Nye: an invitation to pop in to FOFA Gallery for some FUGITIVE MAPPING as part of the VISITATIONS exhibition. Co-composing and reworlding found materials, household products, and so on...  to re-imagine the Grid as enabling constraint for making a break. In an emergency we use whatever we can get our hands on, and go with our hunch even if we can’t put our finger on it. There are so many things we carry and have around that pass through us and issue from us to distribute collective agency in the world. They make things livable, but they’re also killing us... not just as some environmental damage scenario, but in the glimmer of relations not yet given or even allowed. How may we evoke a relational alterNet of social dis/organisation, a kind of monstrous jouissance?
