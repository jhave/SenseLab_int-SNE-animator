Event Description: This event follows and anticipates a series of workshops and reading groups around notions of study, fugitivity, blackness, whiteness, hapticality, feeling and touch. The event is in continuity with the recent publication of Inflexions 8 « Radical Pedagogies » (May 2015) in which the typical student-professor structure was questioned and new modes of knowledge explored.
