The group is seeing a dedicated group of Montreal based artist-researchers and independent artist-curators participate each month, as well as a new wave of researchers skyping in from the international Senselab network. In addition to discussion around the texts, Senselab artist-researcher, Anique Vered, is also experimenting with techniques in collective study and radical pedagogy during the reading groups. This is associated with other Immediations related streams of thought including the Neurodiversity event and the Three Ecologies Institute.
