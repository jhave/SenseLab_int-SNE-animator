The Theatre season has been the first examined artistic part of Vincentâ€™s doctoral artistic research. The latter consists of the articulation of his practice as theater director which focuses on the contemporary relationship in between theatre and time. Those investigations are based on the disruption of human theatrical copresence and its expansion with regard to nonhuman actants, e.g. weather and seasons in the project analysed here. Through this research, he intends to generate an experience of a temporally alternative theater-making based on the hypothesis of an emergent aesthetic regime of heterochrony. This regime is being inspired by studies of the development of living organisms in contemporary evolutionary biology and by the combined approach of the geological and fictional notions of deep time and hypertime.
