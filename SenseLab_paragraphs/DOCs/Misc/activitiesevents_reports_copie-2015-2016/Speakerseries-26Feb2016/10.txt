Contextual Choreography by Simo Kellokumpu
 An Introduction
The artistic research Contextual Choreography focuses on the relations, interconnectedness and reciprocity of choreography and context. The research examines the question how a chosen cultural context operates as a choreographic apparatus.
The presentation in Senselab discloses the processes of ongoing choreographic works Seasons as Choreographers and A guest, which are part of the research. The presentation invited choreographers and researchers to discuss how choreographic art could contribute to the paradigm shift from the choreographer who masters the movement as means of human-centered choreographic construction to the choreographer who disengages him/herself from that mastery and couples him/herself with the complex relationality of surrounding movements that form the conditions for (geo-centric?) organic selfhood. Choreography is approached here as a reading practice instead of being defined by the history of writing.
