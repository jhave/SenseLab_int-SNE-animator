KETL is a speculative think-tank for imagineering affective capitalism as a convergent end-game scenario for planetary urbanism. How might capitalist futurity become so immaterial that the affective texture of our experience becomes operational at a planetary scale? Today, radical shifts appear in our affective relations with the city, somewhere between self and body, the World and the Earth. Part art work, sci-fi premise and ideas incubator, the project cuts across two kettles - from the police application of military kettling tactics, to moments where crisis offers pause to have a cup of tea together.
