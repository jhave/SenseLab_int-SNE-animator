Description of the Activity: 100-250 words. Describe what what the activity consisted in and how it related to Immediations research or other Immediations/SenseLab research-creation activities it may have been in dialogue with.
 
A series of movement research explorations and media performance interventions in the local area recombine their traces for co-composition in collaboration with the process-oriented exhibition Visitations curated by AN Soubiran. Visitations featured Immediations grant recipient Matthew-Robin Nye with artists Jacinthe Loranger and Laura Acosta, Immediations participants Mike Hornblow and Joel Mason, along with invited collaborators and invited participants. Immediations participants hosted an evening of experimental performances and collaborative events in keeping with the research-creation objectives of the partnership grant: Duck Feet and KETL.
DUCK FEETÂ is a love song to blackness, otherness, queerness, and its equally love-induced fractalization of neurotypicality and whiteness as system. This project is a circus in the making; fusing live recording, performance, and bodily contortion, the collboartors seek to involve the audience as co-composers as well as agents of singularity.
