Inspired by the contemporary amalgam of new materialism, non-philosophy, accelerationism and the ‘affective’ and ‘speculative’ turns in Continental philosophy, this prsentation nuances the ‘accelerationist’ stance that the only emancipatory answer to capitalism is to ally with its uprooting and abstracting tendencies ('good sense'), and, following Isabelle Stengers’s ‘etho-ecology’, argues instead that speculative reason cannot be separated from the practical concern for the grounds ('common sense') we speculate upon. By reclaiming the principle of sufficient reason from recent critiques such as that of Quentin Meillassoux as the first principle of a materialist philosophy, its aim is to explore the conditions of enunciation under which a speculative conversion of late capitalist ressentiment into a renewed belief in the world, and thus the production of new forms of subjectivity, becomes feasible. Drawing on James, Whitehead and Deleuze, it proposes a contrast between Leibniz’s solution to the moral problem of damnation or ressentiment and today’s widespread ‘realist’ and ‘criticist’ mindset. It demonstrates that the inclusion of the damned or the ‘men of ressentiment’ in the milieu of common sense, as opposed to their exclusion, may well be the only ‘remedy’ against ressentiment, provided that we understand this milieu speculatively, that is, as an immanent plane that is continuously selected and affirmed as ‘the best’. Finally, what we can learn from this inclusive affirmation of ressentiment is how to avoid the double trap of blind speculation and cynical critique, both of which leave us without protection against the chaotic powers of the groundless ground, i.e. the ‘black holes’ of contemporary capitalism.
