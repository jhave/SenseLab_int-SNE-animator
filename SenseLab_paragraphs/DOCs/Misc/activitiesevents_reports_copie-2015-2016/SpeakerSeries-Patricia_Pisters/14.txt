In this lecture Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein’s cinematographic and theoretical reflections on art guide the discussion of mirror-touch synaesthesia. Eisenstein reflected on synaesthesia in art as related to an “orchestration of the senses”. This orchestration of the senses, however, leads to a deeper layer of the feeling of an artwork that the spectator feels in turn. This “fourth dimension” of affective engagement relates to the physicality of the brain as well as to cultural, social and historical factors and could be conceived as mirror-touch synaesthesia avant-la-lettre. The integrative, dynamic and complex relation between the physical “hardwired” dimensions in the brain and cultural inscription in relation to art is a thorny and still unresolved question that Eisenstein addressed as the central problem (Grundproblem) of art.  Eisenstein’s ideas and his interest in neuroscience as well as in socio-cultural history are remarkably relevant to many contemporary transdisciplinary discussions between art and neuroscience. Contemporary artists such as Rosella Biscotti and John Akomfrah implicitly follow Eisenstein’s traces, investigating memory and history through an orchestration of multiple senses and signs, addressing the spectator as a cultural mirror-touch synaesthete.
