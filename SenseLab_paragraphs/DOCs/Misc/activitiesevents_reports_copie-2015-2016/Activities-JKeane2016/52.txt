Keane, J and Anderson C (2016) Science Lab Dublin 
Submitted a collaborative proposal: A conversation on the signature of all things
(Waiting to hear of acceptance).
For the Science Gallery Dublin, we will present the next iteration of our project on real-time feedback systems for robots. Technics & Touch, was set up as a lab space for collaboration with robots systems. The daily work focused on the emergent behaviour arising from simple rule-based tasks, in this case the complexity that results from drawing with and opening a conversation between humans and robots.  The project entails three components: a series of videos documenting the drawing experiments; a large-format book of the actual drawings generated during the exhibition and a public forum on  “the signature of things” where we collectively consider how material, information and intentional systems each display their own signature and reveal co-emergent properties.
