From the introduction by Keane, Hecq, Campbell and Pont: 
“This volume is predicated on the need and desire to go beyond the mere critical analysis of texts and cultural artefacts to examine the conditions whereby parody works in radically transformative, disruptive or provocative ways, disturbing the dominant paradigms of cultural production. Intrinsic to this is our recognition through art practice that parody is a process of production and reception, not something arrested in cultural artefacts.  Collectively we see the contemporary moment as being in urgent need of an enquiry into parody’s relation to the revolutionary impulse, and to examine the degree to which violence inhabits the heart of parodic practice itself. As such, dealing with ‘the advent of appropriation, quotation, parody and the sampling of cultural codes in literature and the arts,’ need not be ‘concerned with performing the poetics of political correctness, pop cultural commentary and reading rubbish postmodern literature’ (Tofts in this issue).  Serially, and more or less seriously, the volume is intent on tracking the running fuse of parodic action as it affects bodies performative and textual, erupting in laughter, and provoking havoc, both destructive and transformative.”
