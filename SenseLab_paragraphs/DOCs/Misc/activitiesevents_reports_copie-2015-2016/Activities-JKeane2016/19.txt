Description of the Activity: 
The gallery becomes a space where images generated by PSi participants are dimensionalized and habitual modes of viewing are dilated. The two installation work in tandem to expand the performative aspects of image-making and viewing through: expansion and intensification / perception and realisation.  PAN invites PSi participants to collate audio-visuals to be added to the moving panoramic projection, which is shown via a projector mounted to a dolly-track that participants can move and a trackpad (digital input) that viewers can scroll. ZOOM involves the disambiguation of the famous dolly-zoom effect in cinema (where the camera zooms in while moving back or zooms out while moving in) making the wall physically move. Participants are invited to make videos in this space, which they can see in real time on a screen in front of them during the recording. They are asked to reflect upon the way the different technologies (digital and labour intensive) affect their spatial experience.
