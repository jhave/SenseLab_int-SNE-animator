Title of panel: EVOLUTION & EMBODIMENT 
From a range of perspectives across the arts and sciences, this panel will discuss the ways in which embodiment operates within and arts works, which take on a dynamic evolving "life" of their own. The panel will attempt to make explicit the “more than” which cannot be determined by initial conditions. In this indeterminism there is an inherent embodiment, which is why it is such a radical a development in science and so different from classical scientific perspective. 
Title of paper: Art and the Realization of Living
Descriptions of life in the sciences, through experimentation and observation may provide an accurate snapshot of  ‘what a body is’. For artists, this snapshot is seductive challenge to experiment with what a ‘body can be’. In this paper I will address the ways in which artwork and art processes perform and contribute to the understanding of the enactive approach to cognition.
