On September 18 and 19, 2015 the conference “Rethinking Politics through Scattered Imaginaries” aimed to discuss the utility of the humanities and social sciences within various geopolitical contexts, in addition to addressing the possibility of shifting the geopolitics of knowledge or the geography of reason. This interuniverity conference also ushered in a partnership between three research laboratories— the SenseLab at Concordia University, the Laboratoire sur les récits du soi mobile at Université de Montréal, and the Centre Phantasma at Université Babes-Bolyai (Romania)—dedicated to the study of thought in motion (social, political, and creative processes), individual stories of mobility, and structures of the imagination. Furthermore, the conference celebrated the collaboration between the Comparative Literature section of the Department of World Languages and Literatures, Université de Montréal and the Department of Comparative Literature, Babes-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, with a view to extending the discussion to other research centers both in France and in Quebec: the Centre de Recherches sur les Littératures et la Sociopoétique (CELIS) at Université Blaise Pascal (Clermont Ferrand), the Centre de Recherche Société, Droit et Religions at Université de Sherbrooke, and the center for Film and Moving Image Studies at Concordia University.
The act of rethinking politics through scattered imaginaries and images marks an attempt to recover and rearrange the geopolitics of knowledge. While the decolonial approach draws on a mode of thinking divorced from Western Enlightenment, this conference posited non-comprehensiveness as a premise and examined the fields of politics through the recovery of traumatic memory, the destructiveness of torture, anti-utopia, constructs of difference, the dysphoric and traumatic nature of migration literature, experiences of migration and homelessness, aboriginal cultures, spatial and communal politics, Jacques Rancière’s work on art and politics, traces of the sacred and its global implications within literary and philosophical movements, exile and exophony, and diverse cultural practices such as experimental writing, the archive, globalization theory, and autobiographical writings.
