Feedmidst Lab a transdisciplinary mobile laboratory devoted to experiment with ecological systems. This participatory laboratory commingles relational processes, permitting the exchange of new processes and explorations. Feedmidst Lab as an alternative mobile space will like to activate social engagements, crosses paradigms, and responds to environmental, and artistic changes through relational engagement. This mobile laboratory will foster interdisciplinarity and the generation of participatory processes. This mobile approach diversifies and challenges the traditional notion of museums and art exhibitions where the audience does not intervene. Feedmidst Lab is a discovery space that embraces risk and curiosity to reach out to unknown processes and experimentations for personal meaning, engagement and participatory art. This project permits the mobilization of pop up propositions in and out fluidly. This research-creation – relates to the philosophical substructures of the Immediations grant's general theoretical orientation.
