Precarious Telling #3 - We owe each other the indeterminate. We owe each other everything - was an invitation from Justy Phillips, Brian Massumi and Csenge Kolozsvari for an event that asked how undercommons appositionality could be an opening for making a precarious indeterminate liveable through a collectivity of telling - not to solve our individual discomfort, but to give space to a thirdness that re-cracks the cracks if they fill up. As an enabling constraint, they offered the following proposition:
“Bring a text with one other person. The text should be no longer than one printed page. It can be a shared writing, joint writing, half writing, half not-writing or someone else's writing or other.”Participants shared their papers in a setting – and antique store - that was to close a few days after the event.
