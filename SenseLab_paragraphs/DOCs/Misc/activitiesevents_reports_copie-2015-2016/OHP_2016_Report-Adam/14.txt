Not withstanding this growing research, the concept of immediation has yet to be invented! We both begin and return to the work of immediation via this anthology. The call for contributions to this anthology will be sent across theImmediations project’s North American, Australasian and European participants. We will also invite a small number of participants to contribute chapters from outside the Immediations project. Potential invitees include: Richard Grusin, William Connolly, Jane Bennett, Matthew Fuller, Luciana Parisi, Steve Goodman Fred Moten and Stefano Harney, Arno Boehler, Sally Jane Norman, Frederik Tygstrup, Martha Sempert, Gary Genosko, Andrew Goffey. These contributions will ‘respond’ to the call for work on immediation and assist the idea to expand toward a pool of other thinkers and makers for whom questions of relation, event and ecology are already pertinent.
