Submissions: The series has attracted significant interest from potential authors. Since the series began, we have received over twenty-five manuscripts submissions. Our editorial collective comprised of Brian Massumi, Erin Manning, Ronald Rose-Antoinette, Adam Szymanski and Nasrin Himada closely vets each submission before deciding whether or not is should be sent out for review. Due to the highly selective nature of book series and its unique standards which ask authors to incorporate research-creation principles into the writing and making of the books, we have rejected the vast majority of submitted manuscripts, in spite of their mostly high quality.  Below is a list of published and forthcoming books.
