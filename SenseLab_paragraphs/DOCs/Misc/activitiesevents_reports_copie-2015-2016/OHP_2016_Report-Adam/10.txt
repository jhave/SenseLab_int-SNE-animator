Nocturnal Fabulations proposes a series of essays exploring Apichatpong’s cinematic dreamscape. At the core of this project stands the care for the composition of collectives within an ecology that actively includes the more-than-human. Resisting the temptation to analytically elucidate Apichatpong’s dark and alluring cinematic proposition, the authors favor a politico-aesthetic and speculative pragmatist engagement with his work that moves creatively across disciplines. In doing so, they raise the stakes of fabulation in relation to Thailand’s war-torn history and current political turmoil, so as to affirm the possibility of a future that may feel otherwise. Apichatpong’s cinema weaves the ghosts of the past, the textures of the jungle, the sounds of the night and oneiric hues into an aesthetic force-field of differences that carries futurity. The percepts and affects unfolding within his cinema, in all their relative opacity, intensity and ambiguous poly-temporality beckon forth new collective assemblages of enunciation toward an ecological broadening of feelings.
