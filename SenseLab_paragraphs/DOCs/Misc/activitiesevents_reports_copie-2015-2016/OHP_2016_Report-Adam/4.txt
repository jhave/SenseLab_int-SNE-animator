The aim of the Immediations book series is to prolong the wonder sustaining philosophic thought into transdisciplinary encounters through the principle of co-composition. A number of these areas of interdisciplinary co-composition include: art practice, aesthetic theory, political theory, movement practice, media theory, maker culture, science studies, architecture, and philosophy. We invite authors to roam it, and the first six books that we have scheduled for publication traverse these various approaches and disciplines.
Alongside single-author monographs, we have been encouraging experiments in collective writing and new forms of co-composition. We believe that co-composition is an intercession, not a mediation. Our aim is to catch thinking in the midst and compose with it in order to curate thought in the act and reinventing the book.
