Description of the Activity:  In this workshop event we explored different modes of engaging collaboratively with memory and affect and their ways of activating experience between bodies, environment and movement. In three parts we introduced performative, philosophical, and poetic accounts of dealing with experience as a continuous process of composing situations of an immediate and activating quality.
