Arriving in Ottawa on Day 14, we performed an anarchive of the event at Gallery 101. Anarchiving is a process of engaging materials emerging from an event context that seeks to challenge more traditional representational modes of documentation. Anarchived performance seeks to share the affective tone of a process or event rather than relay strict chronologies or typologies of identification. This is a mode of sharing and praxis that emphasizes the trajectory and tone of a creative work as a process rather than as the singularity of an item or object. The anarchive phase of Channel Surf continues the trajectory established in the first two phases by re-emphasizing that any performance of anarchive remains incomplete and open to the occurrence.
