We have deliberately chosen to leave the articulation and explication of contextual politics as they emerged in the relational fabric of experience opened in Channel Surf —to do otherwise would mean encoding and ascribing categories (and limitations) of identity that run counter to the theme of fuzzy thresholds suggested by the project.  Such an approach emphasizes a “politics of touch” that draws on previously established relationships between identities understood as divergent (eg. Indigenous and settler, stasis and flow, ecology and hierarchy)—instead encouraging listening as a primary technique of relational politics and passage. In this sense, aesthetic experience meets (micro)political praxis. This emphasis upon listening-engagement over communicative-demand encourages relational accountability in the broadest sense, for political relations are mobilized in the local-material relations of exchange. Consequently, notions of the gift, giveaway, waste and reciprocity were explored with a view to offering new ethical gestures that might foster more meaningful collaborations between all participants. Although some participants had worked together previously, many were new to one another. Given the dynamic and emergent nature of relations along the journey, new challenges for artistic process were drawn primarily in terms of developing techniques of co-creation within a listening-engagement context.
