Channel Surf is an event-based project that aims to bring together artists, academics, and community members (activists, healers, athletes and others) with a view to exploring practice-based learning through aesthetic experimentation in movement. Recalling the technics of analog television (through the tongue-in-cheek linguistic parallel of ‘channel surfing’), this paddling caravan of thinkers engaged the analog gesture of imagination while canoeing and camping along the Rideau Canal during a 14-day period in June 2015 (following 18 months of research and internet-based collaboration). Significantly, the imaginative space of the canal/channel invited participants to dwell in the between of two signals and in doing so, engage with the simultaneously fuzzy but unique image that is the threshold of passage.
