Participants in the two-week event phase of this project were invited to engage in one of three ways:
a)     Liquids: the core group of paddlers and campers who will begin the journey in Kingston and complete the entire passage along the Rideau Canal to Ottawa;
b)    Catalysts: those who cannot take part for the entire trip but would like the opportunity to join and/or depart the caravan mid-stream;
c)     Effervescents: anyone that would like to join a communal evening event on land along the way.
