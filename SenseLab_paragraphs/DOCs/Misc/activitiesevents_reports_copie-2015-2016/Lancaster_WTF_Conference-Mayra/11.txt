Description of the Activity: 100-250 words. Describe what what the activity consisted in and how it related to Immediations research or other Immediations/SenseLab research-creation activities it may have been in dialogue with.
For the Affect Theory Conference SenseLab proposed to activate a movement and artistic proposition that brought into question the conference’s body and scales of attention. For this it activated a conversation around modes of attention and the fact that a conference often forgets that conference participants have bodies.  SenseLab activated a conversation around movement experimentation, techniques and modes of attention, from there it proposed to create a resting space for the participants of the conference with the techniques of “luring a threading of the space”, “accumulative variation” and “spatio-temporal installations of resting pods”. This activity engaged participants of the conference to join into the construction of the resting site and its continual variation during the conference. At the same time it hosted bodies into resting and activating a different modality to engage with the conference, this allowed for a shift in the atmosphere and for conversations that took place during the conference , around rhythm and multiplicity.
