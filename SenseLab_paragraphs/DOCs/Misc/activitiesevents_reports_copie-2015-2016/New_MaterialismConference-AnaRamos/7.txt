Description of the Activity:
This paper holds a view of experience as being primarily a relational dimension by which dynamic forces get activated. Here, consciousness becomes a with-ness in which bodies-things-percepts-sensations collide: intertwined movements of becoming. These movements constitute the body, but they are not of the body â€” they pass through. They belong to and in-form a multiplicity that is beyond the human, a more-than-human situation, always becoming through a virtual-actual oscillation. It is an introduction to the conceptual synthesis presented in length in the doctoral research entitled Sur les traces du virtuel (Universite de Montreal, department of communication), financed by the Immediations Project.
