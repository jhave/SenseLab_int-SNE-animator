Description of the Activity: 
The first part of the discussion focused on research-creation and modes of evaluation, relevant to the 3-Ecologies project. The second part was dedicated to the chapter 6 of Cinema 2 from Deleuze & Guattari entitled “The Powers of the False” (Puissance du faux) in order to reinforce the difference between fabulation (the power of the false) and other forms of narration. In this text, two modes of narration are defined:  crystal and organic regimes. The question raised was: “To what degree these modalities of crystalline space, direct time, and power of the false can orient us to a politics of fabulation, into modes of survival in relation to the question of urgency and collective work?” Also, screening of a clip from Pour la Suite du Monde.
