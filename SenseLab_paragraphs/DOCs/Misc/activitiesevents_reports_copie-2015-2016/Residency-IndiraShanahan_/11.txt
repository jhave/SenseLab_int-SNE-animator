The residence helped shape my understanding of SenseLab practices, and the way ‘event creation’ unfolds as a collective practice and a medium to define ‘philosophy in action’ or ‘thinking through doing’. It generated a profound affiliation to a community of practice and enabled a broadening of my own understanding of the term ‘embodied practice’ through a deeper and more sustained philosophical lens within the techniques of Immediations. It assisted in strengthening  a philosophical framework to articulate my artistic practice and PhD inquiry through the study of process philosophy. The residency also enabled and opened an invaluable opportunity to connect to a diverse network of artists, researchers, academics and writers. In addition, it also assisted in understanding the longer term trajectory of the Three-Ecologies Institute and the development of new pedagogies within academic and non-academic frameworks (through practice led-research or research creation).
