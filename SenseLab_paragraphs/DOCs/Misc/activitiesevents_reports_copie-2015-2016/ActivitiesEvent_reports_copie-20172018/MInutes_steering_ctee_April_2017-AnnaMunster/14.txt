Erin reported that she has begus discussions with a number of partners and hubs on the exhibition outcomes that are part of stage 3 of the project. Anna, BM, Brian and Erin discussed the importance of understanding where ecologies of practice were already at work and how this might form the basis of a new form of ‘exhibiting’. It will be up to the various involved participants and locations to resolve ways of registering and making felt how these practices were already taking place rather than necessarily ‘touring’ an exhibition form the ‘outside’ to a place. Anna, BM, Brian and Erin agreed that we needed to develop a mode of relaying or ‘curating’ intensities of what was already occurring from event to event (or place to place) and that we might think again about drawing on past techniques such as the Senselab Society of Molecules event from 2009.
