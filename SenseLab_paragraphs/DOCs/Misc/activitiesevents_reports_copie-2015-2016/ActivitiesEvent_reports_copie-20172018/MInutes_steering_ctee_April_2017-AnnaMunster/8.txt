Erin reported that SSHRC has accepted the updates to the mid-term Immediations report. These included a letter and report sent to SSHRC on 22/12/2016 with links to the Distribution of the Insensible event and its outcomes. Erin reported that although she had not heard back from SSHRC, monies for the next stage of the grant had been forthcoming. Hence her understanding is that we have acquitted all requirements for the project up to and including mid-term milestones.
