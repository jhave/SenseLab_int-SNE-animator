Outcomes: The symposium was a terrific learning experience not only for those formally involved in the symposium but other participants who would usually take a more passive role. All were invited to become active participants, thinkers, listeners and co-creators. The symposium delivered on its ability to connect different voices and perspectives, to present various approaches to thinking-feeling-embodying the elements and how doing so allows us to better grapple with our interconnectedness. The aim is to continue to build on these connections and over the next year or so, and to produce a publication on the given theme.
