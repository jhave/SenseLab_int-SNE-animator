Description of the Activity: The SenseLab participated to this event in two different times. First, some members presented our conception of research-creation through the example of the online journal Inflexions. This performative presentation was a really good way to present the ideas of the SenseLab on projects of research-creation. Second, the emissaries of the SenseLab participated to the discussion group on valorization and selection, where our antagonist point of view generated important debates, but also important relational openings.
