Drawing on recent experiences in various immersive writing environments (residencies, labs and bootcamps) the panelists reflect on the opportunities and challenges of “the intensive” as an invitation to reside within one’s research process. Mattie Sempert is fresh from Montreal based SenseLab where she set out to gain a better understanding of how research and creation co-compose, and discovered a narwhal tooth** to be a link between the two. Stayci Taylor is still peeling off the camo’ after a weekend at Thesis Bootcamp where she committed to delivering 20,000 words towards a first draft dissertation. Peta Murray is still recovering from six weeks on display as an artist-in-residence in the Roslyn Smorgon Gallery of the Footscray Community Arts Centre, where she devised and presented performed essays on themes of ageing and the creative life.  How might immersive practice meet feats of endurance as an accelerant for the HDR candidate nearing the pointy end of the research trajectory?
