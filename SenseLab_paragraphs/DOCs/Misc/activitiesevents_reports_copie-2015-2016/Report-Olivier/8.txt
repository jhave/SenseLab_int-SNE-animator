Role of Community Partners: They informed us on different initiatives they are putting forward regarding new forms of educational practices and horizontal organizational structures. For example, through several discussions, Marc-Alexandre Prud’homme and I talked about the vision of education the Redaq is trying to implement in the greater Montreal (free schools based on the equality on intelligences, whose decision process is a direct/democratic one, etc.). As for the AEELI, a Montreal OBNL inside which many organizations (L’Insoumise, an anarchist bookstore and DIRA, a library without any fee or membership obligation, to state the main ones) are integrated, they informed me on how they deal with the obligations of being an OBNL (having a structure, reporting to the authorities, etc.) while maintaining a strong philosophy/practice of independence, autonomy and a refusal of hierarchy.
