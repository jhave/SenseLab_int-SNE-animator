Actively not arriving consisted in the creation of a foyer for encounter and thinking-feeling in a collaborative, open-source environment. Located in a transient area of the conference, the intervention offered specific techniques and materials, such as collective writing, collaging/cut-ups/diagramming, and platforms for discussions. The questions motivating the intervention were: how does study formulate itself as a modular force that can be collectively tended? How do we study together? What is the role of study in contrast to knowledge production and communication?
