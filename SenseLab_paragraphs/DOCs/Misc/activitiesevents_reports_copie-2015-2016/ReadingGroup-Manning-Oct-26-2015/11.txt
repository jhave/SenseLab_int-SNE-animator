Description of the Activity: 
Based on the text written for the "Immediations" volume (Open Humanities Press) by Erin Manning, the discussion revolved around the concept of fabulation. This text talks about the Avoca event in Australia held in 2015 when the SenseLab started working on the concept of the anarchive. It brings the past back in order to think about the techniques that have been created and what we have learned from them. Furthermore, related to the work that had been done through Félix Guattari’s book Cartographies schizoanalystiques, the discussion situates the difference between a personal and a group level as the text places the personal perceptions and feelings as remodulations of the event expressing themselves through the collective level.
