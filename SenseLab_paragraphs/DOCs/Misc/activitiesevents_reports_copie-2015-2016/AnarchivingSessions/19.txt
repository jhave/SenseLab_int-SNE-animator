Currently, the Anarchive is working through a methodology of proliferative pop-up propositions in order to open up anarchiving to different communities, spaces and temporalities. Our aim is that during the next year an Inflexions issue (peer-reviewed online journal of the Senselab) called“The Anarchive”will emerge from these propositions.
