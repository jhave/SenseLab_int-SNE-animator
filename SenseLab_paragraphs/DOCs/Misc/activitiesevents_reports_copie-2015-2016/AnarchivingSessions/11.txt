There have been numerous visits to Artext Montreal in order to do research on archiving and anarchiving techniques. We are in dialogue with FOFA Gallery at Concordia University to further explore our collaboration in building and distributing the Anarchive knowledge and for a possible Launch of the Anarchive. We are working on the dissemination of the Anarchive by contacting further galleries to collaborate with in this research theme. The Milieux Institute (former Hexagram Institute) at Concordia is an ongoing partner. We also held a workshop at the studio space of Montreal-based artist Fiona Annis.
