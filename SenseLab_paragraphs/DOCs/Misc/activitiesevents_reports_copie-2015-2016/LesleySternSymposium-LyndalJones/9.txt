Description of the Activity: 100-250 words. 
The newly created Avoca Chinese Garden, developed in 2014-5 through a $350,000 grant, initiated and led by The Avoca Project, was the subject of an investigation by Lesley Stern for her current book Gardening in a Strange Land, ‘on notions of native and exotic, foreign and domestic, migration and immigration’. 
After spending several days with/in the garden, Professor Stern led a one day symposium for researchers from a number of universities and disciple areas. For many of those who came, this was an opportunity to engage with each other on connections between their own writings on land, landscape, mediation with an internationally regarded writer at the site of her current engagement – both on the page and as part of the site.
