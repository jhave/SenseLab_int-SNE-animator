The collective conducted an investigation of the legal and financial steps needed to form a non-profit educational institution hypothetically called ‘The Three Ecologies Institute’; a centre for art, activism and education in concert. The project objective was to discover and imagine what the constitution of a non-profit organization dedicated to these objectives might look like – couching the language of the Immediations grant and research-creation and its objectives into the highly utilitarian model of Canada Revenue Agency-recognized charitable entity organizational structures. To what extend can an institution with non-hierarchical assemblies bend to existent legal frameworks before it breaks? Qur deliverables for this project were a roadmap for the incorporation of a charitable organization, as well as a draft constitution for such org. We drafted our consititution based on a constitution supplied by with Articule, an artist-run in Montreal, as well as in consultation with the Executive Director of LITE (Local Investment Towards Employment) Winnipeg; Brila Youth Projects, Montreal; Université POP Montreal; and CoCO (The Centre for Community Organizations), Montreal.
