Metabody is a European project that attempts to redefine the body in Media in less reductionist ways than is usual in current information technologies, thus counteracting technology’s increasing tendency to dampen differences by reducing bodies and movements to prescribed forms in current surveillance culture. Metabody proposes a reversal of cybernetics that highlights the indeterminacy of embodied expressions as a key factor for a sustainable society.  This foregrounds the need for a new ethics, which we may call metamedia and biomedia ethics.
