Reversing Cybernetics, Queering Control - Media, Embodiment and the Politics of Indeterminacy.
The workshop will focus on experimentation with perception, movement, spatial and bodily affordances for researching into the way interfaces capture and reduce movement to traceable discreet units, proposing an ontological critique of control society from the perspective of a philosophy of movement. At the same time the workshop will propose to reinvent the affordances of the interface by involving bodily motion in non-reductive ways that foreground the indeterminacy and unquantifiability of movement as experienced through proprioception and other sensing modalities, thus exceeding the rationalistic visual paradigm of Renaissance perspective that pervades current control technologies.
