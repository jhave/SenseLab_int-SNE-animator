Cinema Out of the Box Project
Cinema Out of the Box is a project to develop practical tools for a mobile cinema. Today, our media is defined by mobility, and for some, this means that a “cinematic specificity” has been lost.  On the contrary, the new mobility of cinema (portable devices, such as our laptop screens) means that we can have “cinematic experiences” in new and unexpected ways.  Many filmmakers and performers are experimenting with this. Our project proposes to do three things: 1) design portable infrastructure for a mobile cinema that can take the capacity to project audiovisual materials anywhere: on campus in unexpected locations, up the mountain, in the pool, and beyond 2) develop a year long screening series experimenting with the potential of this new mobility and 3) find the most ecological and sustainable ways to equip our cinema, focusing in this first year on the potential for bicycle powered generators, low energy projectors, and passive sound amplification. Directed by Alanna Thain, with collaboration from students Thomas Pringle and Tyler Lawson, this project has already collaborated with several local organizations in Montreal, including the Native Friendship Centre, the Festival of Temporary Experiences, Suoni per il popolo, CKUT, the Media Crossings Workshop and more. Our mobile cinemas project will make creative use of campus space without requiring elaborate construction or infrastructural support.  Our “pop-up” projection mobile cinema will allow for creative and experimental collaborations, bringing media arts to the campus and wider communities. Likewise, our engagement with bicycle generators, passive amplification, and human powered performance will model the potential for energy-efficient mobile media.
