Summary: 
Cross-platform media-art performance series - Montreal, Mexico City, Toronto, New York, Sydney	
Description
OmegaVille offers a platform for interdisciplinary collaboration around critical perspectives on planetary urbanism, towards a kind of speculative futurity for embodied praxis within everyday experience. These ideas are mobilised through a series of events, works, workshops and symposia, at the intersections of video, performance, sound, installation, mobile and interactive media. Theproject peers through the lens of Google Street View, via cross-platform media, to pose the question - how may we come to occupy infra/planetary bodies that are translocal and untimely, beyond the boundaries of skin and skull? How may this occupation occur through an ecology of practices that is political and ecological as much as social and technical?
Context: The impetus behind the project has been to develop an emergent process and collaborative platform, responding to other projects situated within the Senselab schedule, and as a way of activating partners through the Immediations framework.
