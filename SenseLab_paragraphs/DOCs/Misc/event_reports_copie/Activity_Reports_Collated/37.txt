O'Noir 
This event was a large-scale collaboration with fifteen activators: Michael Montanaro, Erin Manning (Senselab), Erin Fortier, Carole Prieur, Mayra Morales (Senselab), Csenge Kolozsvari (Senselab), Maria Kefirova, Sara Hanley, Elizabeth Langley, Alexandre Larose, Mark Sussman, Philip Szporer, Suzanne Schmitt (Senselab), Doug Van Nort, extended by a many Senselab members at the event: Mike Hornblow, Alanna Thain, Thomas Pringle, Toni Pape, Celine Pereira, Noemie Solomon, and Katja Phillipp and more.  
The event was open to the public and well-attended; more than 80 people participated in the shared meal/lecture in total darkness (the number of participants was restricted by the capacity of the restaurant). 
This symbolic and yet pragmatic site opened up the space for an experimental approach in how we can (or cannot) create a situation where open attention and sensorial perception becomes a source of knowledge. The meal-discussion in the dark was an attempt for disorienting us in order to redefine new ways of perception and communication. Sound experiments, vocalizations, breathing exercises, Deep Listening activities, the immersion in the senses and in silence were as much part of the event, as readings of poems, explorations in movement, the urge to leave, emergent activities, imporvised storytelling, rehearsed performance and one-by-one conversations.
