The screening series culminated in a research-creation event held on May 12 and 13, 2014, at the Moving Image Research Lab, McGill University (Immediations partner institution). The event consisted of two roundtables, one on “Documentary and Performance” and one on “Fabulation and Ethics.” Each roundtable served as the springboard for a research-creation workshop which explored the potential for alternative immediate relations with film.
The detailed schedule of the event was as follows:
