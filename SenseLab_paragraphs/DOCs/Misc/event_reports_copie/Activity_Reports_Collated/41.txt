Meeting place: Concordia University, EV building, 10th floor, room 785.
The SenseLab has been hosting reading-groups since its creation in 2004. Recent discussions have centred around the philosophies of Arakawa and Gins, Deleuze, Guattari, and Nietzsche. 
Each reading group is an opportunity to generate a collective understanding of the line of thought operating/tracing in the readings. What we propose is to ask how movements of thought can engender creative tools that further the production of knowledge. Concepts do not preexist their formation in the world. The goal is to activate them in the real, to perform their efficacy, that is, to make them live on their own. Concepts and techniques are collectively crafted, experimented, pushed to their limits. They are materially felt in our art practices. Outside of any sensible existence, they mean nothing. The Immediations events are both the effects and the reasons of its process. People come and go with words, things, beings. Anyone is a member who feels him- or herself to be one. 
Reading-groups are usually announced 3 to 4 weeks in advance on our web-based platforms (Twitter & Facebookâ€”see images below). People can always assist to the readings via Skype. We always do our best to audio-record the sessions and make the files available to our partners and multimedia followers (on-demand). The reading-groups are free of charge. Everyone is welcome!
