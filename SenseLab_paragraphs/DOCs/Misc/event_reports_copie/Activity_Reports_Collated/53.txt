2) Building Movements exhibition. July 21-26, 2013
The exhibition was a direct outcome of the Building Movements workshop. Taking the building as a site for research and experimentation, Building Movements worked directly upon a new RMIT research facility: the Design Hub, Melbourne, Australia. Through installations, artworks, and performance this exhibition probed and played with aspects of the building in ways that interfered with habituated approaches we might otherwise (more automatically) entertain. 
Projects by: Pia Ednie-Brown, Jondi Keane, Chris Cottrell, Scott Andrew Elliott, Olivia Pintosâ€“Lopez, James Carey, Zuzana Kovar, Nick Skepper, and Adele Varcoe. 
Open to the public.
