This Melbourne gathering aimed to draw together a local (largely Melbourne-based) community to tentatively generate a shared ‘body of actions’. This event was organized to coincide with PhD candidate Scott Andrew Elliot’s Melbourne Immediations residency. We attended to the notion of constructed environments (buildings, clothes, landscapes, interiors…) as active participants in ecologies of lived experience. There was particular interest in how we can more explicitly approach our environments as spatial research devices, ie: how constructed environments can offer key questions and provocations in any research enquiry.  The workshop had an open-ended format that allowed a group of creative practice researchers to take some collective steps toward the Immediations project, and toward the production of a substantial exhibition.
Workshop: Closed to public
Workshop numbers: 13 (2 institutional representatives, one community representative), 10 postgraduate students.
