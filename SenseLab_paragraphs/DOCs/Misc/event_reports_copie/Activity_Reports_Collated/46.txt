Writer-in-residence, SenseLab 2013-2014 (Melora Koepke)
As SenseLab'sWriter-In-Residence beginning in August 2013, my main activities have been related to knowledge transfer. 
Following an article I authored in The Montreal Gazette in August 2013 about SenseLab's event 3 Mile Meal, I joined SenseLab as a participant and researcher. 
I have since participated in the regular schedule of events, including the Bioscleave in Mekoos, Quebec in October 2013 and the Glasshouse (Immanent Editing ) in June 2014, as well as monthly Reading Groups, occasional Precarity Sessions, and many other events. While I have joined these events as a researcher and participant and have also undertaken tasks of information and research dissemination from within the experience of the event, including ongoing efforts towards positioning in various national and local media including the CBC, La Presse, the Globe and Mail et al. 
With several other SenseLab members, I am also in-process on a proposal to the National Film Board of Canada related to SenseLab's concept of the Anarchive and future development of same.
My participation in SenseLab's activities, as well as my ongoing work in knowledge transfer and dissemination of the research questions with which SenseLab is engaged on an ongoing basis, are informed by my own research questions in my practice as a journalist and researcher (I am working on a Ph.D in Human Geogrpahy around public/shared meals and food distribution, and have worked professionally as a culinary and cultural journalist for almost two decades). 
Senselab's Immediations project positions us at the forefront of Research-Creation, a stream of conceptual art that allows for the idea that art is "processual": that need not only be concerned with product, but process: That the making-of art is as important as what is made. 
SenseLab works with Research-Creation because we know it has the potential to develop our understanding of how we as humans relate to each other in the public sphere. It also has the potential to engage people in conversations about art from which the public from which certain members of our communities have historically been sometimes excluded; so, to light new pathways to co-existence and co-creation. 
My function at SenseLab has also been to work towards framing the questions asked by SenseLab's approach to Research-Creation in the context of a story to which the public can have access to and participate in. There is a narrative about Research-Creation as an emergent art form.
