Tango 
The second event was organized around tango movement - as a practice that problematizes the nostalgia for reaching among each other from the very premises of the body in movement and in relation. “In tango we have a one to one encounter, yet, we dance to the tragedies of existing together while being always apart, only reaching, in constant collaboration.” (Erin Manning). 
This event was composed into two parts, with an intercession:
The first part was led by Bobby Thompson & Carol Horowitz. They are versatile dancer-choreographers-teachers who after touring for many years with a variety of internationally renowned dance companies, now devote their time almost exclusively to the Argentine Tango. They opened Studio Tango Montreal in September, 1997. They led a tango workshop, sharing their experience about the and operational traditions of Argentine Tango.  
Mathieu Brossard, a popular Tango DJ with a huge repertoire of recorded music he played weekly in many of the larger milongas (tango dance halls) in Buenos Aires. He has lead a discussion on tango music and its historical context. 
In the third part, Erin Manning led a workshop focusing on the relational movement of Tango, “an improvisatory machine for complexified ways of conviviality”. Here, participants were invited to take part in a series of explorations in how bodies create an ecology of relations, and move within this field constantly making and re-making connections through a choreography of movements, breath, faciality and touch (both virtual and actual). 
Senselab participants: Toni Pape, Alanna Thain, Mayra Morales, Celine Pereira, Mike Hornblow, Peter Weibrecht, Diego Gil, Maude,  Maud Watel Kazak, and more. 
The event took place in the Dance Department Black Box, approximately 60 participants attended. Honing the complexity of this event, group conversations, connections and disconnections, lectures, chairs and movements, lights, understandings, sounds and food were all part of the field.
