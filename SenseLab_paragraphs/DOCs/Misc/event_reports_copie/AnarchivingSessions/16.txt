Anarchival practices explore materials as movements of thought; techniques we have explored include folding experiments (both fabric and paper), mobile cartographies (creating alternative geographies and landing sites), photographic and printing experiments (cyanotype and polaroids, with a focus on the duration of the photographic process), movement techniques (focused primarily on developing attunement), and choreographic objects (working with the co-compositional force of materiality).
