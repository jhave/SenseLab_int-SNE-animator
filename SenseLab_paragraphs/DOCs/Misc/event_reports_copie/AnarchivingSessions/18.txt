So far the Anarchive sessions have produced 6 hours of recorded conversations around the concept of the anarchive. A series of artworks with fabric, strings and other materials toward building an installation dedicated to the anarchive. A series of booklets around anarchiving. Four international anarchiving emissaries in the form of Anarchive-boxes that travel to other hubs to dissiminate the work of anarchiving and to activate new research around the concept.
