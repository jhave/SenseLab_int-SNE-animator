In the process of anarchiving developed during these weekly sessions, we consider both material and thought as a force of form. In its engagement with the force of form, the anarchive is invested in the question of how to make felt the infra-perceptible in live events. How to make operative that which resists pinning down? How to activate the surplus share of experience without committing to a full capture of its potential? How to view research-creation as an engagement with an event-based practice that moves beyond the artist as individual?
