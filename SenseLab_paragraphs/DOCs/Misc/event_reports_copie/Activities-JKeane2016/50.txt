Keane J and Barry K. (2016) Syncing To and Fro 
2016 Post Screen Festival of Art, New Media and Cybercultures – Lisbon, Portugal.  
Festival theme: intermittence+Interference.
“Syncing To and Fro” is a collaborative interactive installation consisting of two complimentary works that expand mobile sensory perceptions of walking. Walking is never continuous or steady; it is an ongoing process of adapting and recalibrating in response to interference. Haphazard interactions with the ground, muscles, shoes, other pedestrians, and so on, become a field of multi-sensory interferences in which we momentarily pause, intermitting the momentum, then resume having realigned ourselves to the new conditions that propel us onwards.
