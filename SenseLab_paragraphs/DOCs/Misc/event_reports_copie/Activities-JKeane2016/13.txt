Description of the Activity: 
Simon Twose, in his introduction to the book states: 
“Drawing Is/Not Building began with a simple impression; of drawing and building being one and the same, as if both were merged in a curious stereoscopic image. Bringing them together jolted things into question, especially relations between representation, occupation and matter. In this weird shared space, drawings gained the mass and presence of buildings and buildings the criticality of art…
This book is an extension of Drawing Is/Not Building and uses the work in the show as an armature for a larger discussion about contemporary architectural drawing.”
My contribution to the book was a text that briefly investigated the notion of drawing as enactment that is not so easy to say I it is not building and not so obvious to ay that is it. And the drawing I produced suggested a space that bridges the digital and paper bound notations.
