Description of the Activity: 
My essay in the special issue of Inflexions consists of a series of variations on a text to produce and editor’s introduction to Madeline and Arakawa’s work Encyclopaedia of mistakes. The shifts and changes to each version are not just an indicative of a writing process but of coming to terms, literally, with the radical tentativeness that the terminological junction raises. Writing that chases the tail of its co-emergent meaning is very much like the tremblant jewellery of the 19th century in which each jewel is hinged allowing each stone and link many more degrees of freedom, creating a dancing and trembling of light that is kinetically linked to the wearers movements. In this way the process of learning is, or needs to be under constant adjustment.
