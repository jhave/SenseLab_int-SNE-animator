Knots of Thought is a collaborative encounter between participants from different disciplines to make visible the potential pathways to follow presented by a non resolved question, a blockage or an obsession concerning an aesthetic-theoretical practice. During each session an invited guest brings a knot of thought – a productive not yet resolved thought/practice – that functions as a detonator for the participants to start an untangling process through movement practices of any kind (verbal, physical, imaginary). Hopefully triggering a merging within a spontaneous autonomous choreographic movement performing an open intensification to the knot. The questions at the heart of these sessions are: what is a knot of thought? How do we work from them, cut into them, and open up new ideas from their densities into new intensities? In permeability with Movements of Thought, this series invites participants to explore the strange performativity of the knots of thought.
