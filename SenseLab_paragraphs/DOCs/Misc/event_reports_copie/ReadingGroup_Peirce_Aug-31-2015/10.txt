Description of the Activity: 
This Reading Group of the chapter “Law of Mind” (Peirce) discussed the concepts of time and consciousness in order to understand direct/immediate experience and the way perception/feeling of a temporal sequence unfolds intensively and extensively. The reading of Peirce brings, through the relation of mediate and immediate, a way to begin to think about perception. It might be an answer to the main question of the contemporary notion of cognition that wants to be able to identify where perception begins and ends. Through the complexity of mediation, Peirce introduces the concept of immediation, at the limit of perception: a more-than happening at the turbulence of quality that can’t be addressed outside this turbulence.
