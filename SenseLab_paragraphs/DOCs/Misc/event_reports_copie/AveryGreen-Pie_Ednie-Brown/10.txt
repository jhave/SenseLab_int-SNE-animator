Avery Green is an architectural research project focused around the transformation of a house.  
The project explored how ostensibly non-living things such as drawings and buildings toggle between immediation and mediation, and how this process can be understood to be constitutive of an emergent collectivity. There are (at least) two sides to this interest :
a desire to usher attention away from a focus on human activities – which largely dominates in explorations of collectivity – in order to offer inanimate characters, such as buildings, a more active place at the table of events. The degree to which they tend to be cast into the background impacts on our capacity to acknowledge and draw upon their on-going immediations. 
 to allow inanimate, ostensibly human-made artifacts to become less defined by human ownership or authorship, such that we might have a better chance of taking their powers of immediation into account, and to work with them in amplifying these capacities. 
The project operates in dialogue with projects by two Immediations partners : the Avoca Project (re the ways and degrees to which a house participates in collective events), and Arakawa and Gins’ Bioscleave House which informed the project in important ways. 
A paper about this project titled Architectural Immediations was written for inclusion in the forthcoming Immediations book, and a web site has been produced for the project : averygreen.org
