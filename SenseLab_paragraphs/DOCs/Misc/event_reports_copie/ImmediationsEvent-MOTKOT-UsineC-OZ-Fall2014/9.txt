Proposition 3. Writing time.
We asked participants to write down in pink cards their knots. We gave time for this process. At the end the knots were collected and kept in a bag for the next session. It is interesting that collectively it was decided not to peak on the knots but to keep them there. What may become of these knots in the future? What if they can become propositions for the future?
