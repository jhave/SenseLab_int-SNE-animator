The use of sound, was explored as a ‘rhythm for entering’, in addition to the proposition to ‘find a back’. It was for the first time, we explored this proposition as an opening exercise, before introducing one long continuous rope that we randomly snaked amongst participants stationed on the floor along with a limited amount of green elastics. An open piano, 75 ft of white rope, and 12 elastics became our relational material for this activation.
