Proposition 2. And-troduction Technique for Immanent live editing.
Instead of introducing the SenseLab we tried to question knowing what really the SenseLab is because in a way, part of what the SenseLab seeks is its own collective invention in order to challenge structures of permanence or edifices of power. Based on this it occurred to do an and-troduction instead of an introduction. Borrowed from theatre story-telling we invited the group of participants to say something short about or in relation to the SenseLab real or imaginary, welcoming fiction at all times, followed by a conjuncture in the form of AND…, this conjuncture could change into OR…, ELSE…, SO… These conjunctors were connective tools to give a gluey sense to the disconnected pieces of stories in relation to the SenseLab. For our surprise, the exercise took almost 30 minutes and we all became participants, the role of guiding or leading the event was erased and everyone started inducing suggestions and small variations to the game. We were all engaged in a creative stream of collective invention.
