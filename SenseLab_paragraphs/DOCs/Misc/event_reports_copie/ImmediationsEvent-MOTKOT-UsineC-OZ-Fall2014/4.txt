The fall 2014 KOT/MOT session would explore recursive rhythms for beginning again, but from the middle of where we were last session, and with what we still do not yet know. Rather than curating each session as a distinct event, each M.O.T. and K.O.T. was open to the warp and weft with the other, and with propositions re-crafted within the immediacy of that particular day (the affective tonalities colouring the environment with participants), rather than having everything decided and spoken for in advance. Materials were gifted as invitations and rhythms for beginning, but with enough mobility for inventing ‘the how’ of that encounter, across a multiplicity of appetitions participants may carry, or the environment may propose. Could we also explore the transition between Knots of Thought and Movements of Thought, as a process of transduction spirallingly so.
