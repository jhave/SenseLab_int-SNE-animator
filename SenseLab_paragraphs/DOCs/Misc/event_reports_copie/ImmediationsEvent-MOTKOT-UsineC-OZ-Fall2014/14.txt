We then gathered informally at the base of the stairs and rather than invite an open conversation to commence, we would try to build an emergent collective conversation threading together the response texts we had all written. Participants randomly selected one or more index cards from the pile to read, and if they chose to, and without a designated order or formal invitation, they could read aloud these texts when and however often they felt pulled in to do so by the threading conversation. This reading-conversational experiment proceeded to take on similar rhythms to the material processes we had just experienced. Out of the flurries and multiple fades, there were pauses and broken sentences repeating into rhythmic looping segments and a spoken word piece emerged resonating with our collective voice.
 
       Traces from this collective reading technique will re emerge in a keynote address, in an editing session for our inflections journal and for an opening workshop session at the University for Latin America in Pueblo in Mexico.
