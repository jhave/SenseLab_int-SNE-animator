An old piano became an unexpected gift in the space.It was played in a granular and loose way in the beginning, tonally rather than melodically, and then taken up by other onsite participants in more music-based improvisational ways. The relational movement between sound and movement was something first introduced at a K.O.T. session in Montreal, and here it was once again explored but with a difference in its fielding of the event. This time, only the piano was used sonically, rather then any other textures or architectures in the space. However both cases exercised the ability to fold sound into the movement propositions, without any prior discussion or verbal invitation, to new participants. Anyone who felt pulled to play sonically did so, and without a sense of division from what was happening across the bodies in the space. Sound as a lure for feeling shifts of the relation, proved once again to be an effective technique. Who was leading and who was following, and whether a ‘between’ that was both/and rather than one or the other, was felt out for elastically. This was not an a mere ‘accompaniment’ but a playing with and in relation.
