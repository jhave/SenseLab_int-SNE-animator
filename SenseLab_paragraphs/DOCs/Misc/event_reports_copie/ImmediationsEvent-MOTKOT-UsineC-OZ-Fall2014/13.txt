Arriving, experimenting, and casual conversations, occurred in tandem blurring the separation between social encounters and the investigatory session underway. The structureless quality of this sessionâ€™s arrangement created multiple opportunities and rhythms for participants to enter.
 
       Plastic bags were filled with air and with water. Bags became appendages and extensions to the body, the architecture, becoming costumes, and holding vessels.  Verbal and nonverbal games and scenarios emerged with rhythms that included stopping, exiting, reentering, boredom, and restarting, over the duration of an hour.
 
      We wondered what else might emerge out of this unstructured hour, and so without calling the session to order, pink index cards and pencils were slowly distributed to each participants with a prompt: share something that either emerged or submerged during the process of the previous hour. These index cards were then collected and added to the pink index cards that were collected from the previous KOT session.
