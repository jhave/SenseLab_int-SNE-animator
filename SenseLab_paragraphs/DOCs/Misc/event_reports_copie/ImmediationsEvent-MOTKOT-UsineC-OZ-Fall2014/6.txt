Proposition 1. Finding knots in the room.
 We were used to invite guests to share a knot with attendees and find a way to move the knot. As a new proposition and in relation to the circumstances we posed the question: what if thereâ€™s no special guest to share a knot but we explore the knots that participants already bring with them, even if sometimes these very knots are unknown to them or us. What could be discovered in the journey departing from something that has to be seeked in the very moment instead of tending to an event from a pre-arranged and pre-imagined encounter? How could we bring value back to experimenting with the encounter itself, so participants are not passive listeners but active collaborators?
