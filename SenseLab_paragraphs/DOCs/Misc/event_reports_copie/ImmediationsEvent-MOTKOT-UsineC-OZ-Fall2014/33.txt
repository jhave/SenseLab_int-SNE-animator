Entering into emergent collectivities
How to start with what's already there - Us, the participants-environment.
This workshop focuses on improvisation to activate ecologies of attention: with our bodies, the existing environment, architectural forces and even the weather, to foreground a thinking-feeling-making event.
 
In the week between the pop up activation in Avoca and this workshop, we began to amass ideas for different movement gestures, materials, and duration activators to include in the propositions at COFA. We took note of the existing architecture and furniture that would be present at our new site, for example, the roomâ€™s blue chairs, and these were included as components in this new propositional material. As well, to retain our commitment to emergent collectivity research, we had to ensure that this preparatory work would not land us back into a pre-choreographed working scenario. It meant that we would need to activate anew yet again with our new material.
