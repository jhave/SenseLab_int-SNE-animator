In a mini activation the night before the workshop, all the ideas were printed and then we cut them into individual strips, effectively disassembling these ideas back into material components to co compose with fresh. We also wanted to open this possibility to the participants the following day so that they too, could invent or edit new propositions while the event was already in progress. An area for pre printed texts, markers, scissors, and paper, would be included in the workshop space.
