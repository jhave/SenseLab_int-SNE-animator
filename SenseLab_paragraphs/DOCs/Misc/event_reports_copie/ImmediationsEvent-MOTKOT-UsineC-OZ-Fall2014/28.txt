The stuttering with which the ending of this activity ended, illustrated a particular aspect of this. A technique for ending, where the ending of just the body-based movement, or just the music, had the potential to through the other completely off-balance. Both had to find a way to end together in the relation; both had to invent an appetite for ending. For this reason there was a recursive tendency at the end of this event, in which the participants seemed to be feeling out for a deceleration, only to have the rhythm taken up again and re-activated. Finally a more traditional ‘cut’ had to made, by asking that piano player to slow down and eventually end his playing. Although this approach was problematic, it opened up a dialogue for  ‘how to end’ while still 'caring for the relation’ and singularizing appetites.
