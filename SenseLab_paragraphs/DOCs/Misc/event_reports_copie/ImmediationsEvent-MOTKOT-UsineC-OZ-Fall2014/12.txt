This Movements of Thought session began without introductions, without an obvious starting time, and without clear instructions. Instead, upon entering, participants encountered the Usine-C tables and chairs distributed randomly beyond the usual lobby to incorporate the staircase as a possible in-between space to consider working in[on]. Stacks of clear plastic bags in quantities of 50 were placed throughout and the KOT/MOT facilitators were already engaged exploring the materiality of these plastic bags and their potential within the space.
