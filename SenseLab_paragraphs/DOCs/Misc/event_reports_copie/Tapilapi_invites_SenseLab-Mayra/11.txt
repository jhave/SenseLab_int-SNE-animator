During the course of a two hours workshop the local and international performance group collaborated with SenseLab participants and visiting artist to practice some movement and sculpture techniques in order to collaborativelly co-compose n emergent environment in the form of an video opera. As a result the workshop produced a digital anarchive of movement techniques in relation of questions with objects and materiality as a force in its own right. This is related with the immediations grant as it investigates in practice the how of research creation at the intersection of dance, sculpture and philosophy in the making. Also questions of artistic value were explored.
