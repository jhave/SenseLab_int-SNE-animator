From February to May, 2014 Knots of Thought met monthly at Usine Câ€™s Le Plancher to generate shared reflection and cross-disciplinary dialogues. These meetings created a space for SenseLab members to address the concerns of their practices and their research in a collective manner, also serving as an opportunity to meet with newcomers and international guests. The conversations shuttled between theoretical and artistic contributions, moving transversally from reflections on rumours and digital media to philosophy, and from music improvisation to research on public feeling and infectious sound. Meeting on Wednesday afternoons in the sunlit lobby at Usine C, we created a pop-up lounge for contributors to reflect on questions at the heart of their current practices and research.
