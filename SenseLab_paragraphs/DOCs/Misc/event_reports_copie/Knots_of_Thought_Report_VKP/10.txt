Our final Knot this spring (21/06) invites Eldritch Priest, a SSHRC post-doctoral researcher working with Brian Massumi, to share his work on sound, refrains, and structures of repetition. His proposed gathering on “Ear Worms” offers shared philosophical and sonic explorations of fragments of melody that repeat and infect our memories unbidden. Priest’s knot will be preceded the week before the Usine C event with a SenseLab group reading of Steve Goodwin’s “1971: The Earworm,” Peter Szendy’s Hits: Philosophy in the Jukebox (excerpt), and Hans Raffaseder’s “Audio Brands and Brand Sounds.”
