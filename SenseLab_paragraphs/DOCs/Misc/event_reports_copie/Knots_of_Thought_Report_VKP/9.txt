In April (23/04), we focused on affect and memory, returning to music as a strategy for decentring speech as a medium of working-thinking. This session began with Brian Massumi’s reflections on forgetting and dementia, approaching fear as a silent, affective preoccupation dense with accumulated conceptions of the subject in time. Massumi’s reflection was followed by cellist Ian Gibbons, contributing a knot on improvisation and practicing scores, such as Bach’s, over a lifetime of practice, reflecting on the experience of playing with his grandfather as a listener late in life when other forms of communication were blocked by language and memory. Following a group writing exercise, Adam Szymanski, a core SenseLab member and Concordia PhD student in film studies, opened a reflection on public feelings and film, addressing his dissertation prospectus on cinema and depression as sites of the blurring of public and private experience. Laura Ilea then returned to collect photographs ‘of’ fear that she had invited the group to participate in during the month between knots.
