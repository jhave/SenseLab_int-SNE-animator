In March (26/03), Knots embarked on “The Thing We Do Not Perceive Yet,” exploring temporal delays and leakage as ways of conceiving changing relationships to events. Corina and Laura Ilea brought bilingual knots, short fiction and photography, into conversation, also improvising timing with guest sound artist and theremin player John Jacob Courtney. Then Macklin Kowal, a prospective graduate student, dancer, and performance studies scholar visiting from New York, shared his performance research on leaking, a concept of illicit transmission spanning the body as well as information.
