“Wrappings and Openings” (26/02) invited guest Richard K. Sherwin, professor of visual communications and law (NYU on Fulbright exchange at McGill), to reflect on knottings of performance and digital media, exploring investments in digital rumours, hoaxes, and theatre. Concordia M.A. student and visual artist Csenge Kolozsvari then passed a hand-held, two-channel video work around the group, connecting breath to sculpture and performative knottings in sound and video art. Paris VIII doctoral candidate Ronald Rose Antoinette (philosophy) and guest Maude Wattel (devised performance) then initiated a surprise reading environment, sharing Rose’s unfinished and abandoned, French-language novel as a temporal meditation on texts in suspension.
