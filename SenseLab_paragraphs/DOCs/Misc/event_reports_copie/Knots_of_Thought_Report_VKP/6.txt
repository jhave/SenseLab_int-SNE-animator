Alternating with Movements of Thought, Knots invited artists and scholars to engage across textual and non-textual practices, addressing leaping-off points, intensities, and blockages vital to their current work. Grappling together with recurring preoccupations and shared experience, Knots thus invited conversations between members’ projects and those of researchers new to the group. These meetings, as with all of SenseLab’s events, were open to the public, and they sought with particular emphasis to involve new members and visitors to Montreal.
