The entire event brought together dancers, other performers and thinkers around the question of improvisation in performance. There were three afternoon sessions in the middle of the two week event run by grant Co-Applicant Jondi Keane with internationally known expert on performance improvisation Andrew Morrish. Grant/Senselab participants participated in these sessions. They were also able to participate in improvisation workshops with e.g. Alice Cummins, Rosalind Crisp and Ros Warby.
