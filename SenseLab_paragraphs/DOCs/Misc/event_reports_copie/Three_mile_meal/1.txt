Last August, SenseLab produced 3 Mile Meal in collaboration with Boston's Design Centre for Social Intervention (DC4SI), a Community Partner in Immediations. This event was born from a desire to design an event that would bring the larger-frame goals of Immediations into the public sphere, and also to create an event for the community at large that would integrate SenseLab and our aims through Immediations "to the streets".
