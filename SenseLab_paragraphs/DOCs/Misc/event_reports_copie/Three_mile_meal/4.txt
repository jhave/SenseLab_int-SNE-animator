The three public kitchens were linked by three “lack of information booths”  - mobile sculptures designed by SenseLab and built from Schwinn tricycles that circulated between the sites providing foliage, spices and drinks. They were also linked to the three sites via handlebar-mounted iPads that shared video linkage throughout the three-day event.
