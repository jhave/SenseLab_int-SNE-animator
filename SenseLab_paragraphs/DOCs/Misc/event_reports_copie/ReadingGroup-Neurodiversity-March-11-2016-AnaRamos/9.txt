Description of the Activity: 
The focus of this reading group was to prepare the Neurodiversity Event to be held the following days (12-16 march). The text discussed was “Gobs and Gobs of Metaphor” by Ralph James Savarese. One of the concepts being discussed is metaphor understood not as representation, but as a mobility of thought, a movement of thought (as in Deleuze’s introduction to the translation of Difference and Repetition). In this sense, the understanding of the text suggests the concept metamorphical. Since what autistics do is to re-invent language, to address autistic language as metaphorical would present lyrical limitations, whereas a metamorphical understanding would better address the creative aspect intrinsic to the relation autistics have with language.
