In early 2015, it became clear that there was an alignment between four Senselab artist-researchers and the work of Senselab partner D4SI. For a week long period in June,  Senselab brought the four artist-researchers together at DS4SI for an investigation into socially engaged arts and spatial justice. Specifically, each artist-researcher brought their own unique research-creation pathway to explore including: the body, blackness and affect (Joel Mason); mobile social engagement spaces, public actions and nomadic-border mobility (Siglinde Langholz); Butoh and food-led social interventions (Mike Hornblow); as well as affect and intimacy in a broken commons, and the sticky contact zones of socially-engaged arts (Anique Vered).
