Description of the Activity: 
The reading material was related to the concept of ‘water’ and ‘whose water am I ?’, which the three hubs had decided to concentrate upon at the close of the Sydney 2014, Immediations event. This was to provide continuity between the research creation that took place in Sydney and in preparation for European-based events in 2016
