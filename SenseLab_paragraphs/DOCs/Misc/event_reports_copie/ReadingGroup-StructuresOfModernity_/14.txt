This reading group was born out of a course created by Senselab affiliate Professor Tom LaMarre conducted at McGill University in the Fall of 2015, that triangulated Marx's Capital I, Deleuze and Guattari's Anti-Oedipus and Graeber's Debt: The First 5000 Years. Tom designed the course to be two semesters and based on the pertinent and stimulating nature of the continued reading list, he suggested Anique Vered consider facilitating a monthly reading group to move through the second block of readings.
