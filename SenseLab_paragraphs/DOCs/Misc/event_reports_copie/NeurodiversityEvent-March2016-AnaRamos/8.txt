Description of the Activity: 
The Techniques for Neurodiversity Event asks what kinds of modes of existence does neurodiversity bring into being? What techniques do the neurodiverse make operative to orient themselves (and others) in this predominantly neurotypically-influenced world? What else might the world look like (and feel like) were neurodiverse techniques foregrounded in pedagogy, art, research-creation? Through a close reading of Tito Mukhopadhyayâ€™s Plankton Dreams, this SenseLab event was an invitation to experiment with techniques for neurodiversity.
