During my post-doctoral research I began work on a new manuscript which argues that under certain conditions it’s better to think about how sound is felt as thought more than it is listened to. I take the “earworm” (a song that gets stuck in your head) as the primary figure by which to question how sonic abstractions are implicated in contemporary issues regarding the essence of distraction and attention, affective contagion, and the status of “executive function” as a meaningful category separating human from nonhuman mentality. This work relates to Immediations in its aim to reassess what abstraction means by extrapolating from a musical sense of abstraction a concept of virtuality whose proximity to pure potential approaches the condition of daydreams
