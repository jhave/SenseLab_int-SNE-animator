NOVEMBER-DECEMBER 2014 
Australian events, November 22 to December 13, including a participatory keynote-conversation at the Cultural Studies Association of Australasia (CSAA) Conference 2014, 3 - 5 December 2014, University of Wollongong.
Abstract for the keynote: Erin Manning and Brian Massumi propose a participatory keynote-conversation on thinking in the act. Coming in the aftermath of the publication of their book Thought in the Act: Passages in the Ecology of Experience, they would like to think collectively about what a thinking in the act might look like. How is making a mode of thinking in its own right? What are the conditions necessary for creating a field of experience that activates a thinking that is immanent to the event? What is thinking when it doesn't resolve itself in language? How is language itself a form of making? These questions, which touch on the question of how knowledge is crafted, reconsider the question of value. Can we consider value as a force rather than a content, as an act or an event minus its form or function? What kind of activist philosophy does this approach propose? What kind of activist politics does it seed?
