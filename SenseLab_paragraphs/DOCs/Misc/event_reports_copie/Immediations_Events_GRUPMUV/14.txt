Three questions were asked to all participants: What role does drawing play in your practice? How would you qualify the effects of movement in your drawing practice? What are the types and degrees of intensity that are activated by movement in your practice? In this way, Grupmuv invited the speakers and other participants to a stimulating exchange about drawing as intensified by movement. The three guests engaged in conversation discussed the role of drawing in their practices, along with the moderators and the public participating in the event. The relation between movement and drawing was explored through discussion and also a paper gathered traces of those present who wished to leave drawn traces of their experience.
