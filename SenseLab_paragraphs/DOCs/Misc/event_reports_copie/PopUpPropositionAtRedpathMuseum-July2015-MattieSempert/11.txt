This pop-up proposition used the concept of exposure – of feeling as a way of moving -- as an opening for more collaborative and speculative thinking.  The proposition popped-up to coincide with the conceptual tendencies stirred by concurrent readings-gatherings from Moten and Harney’s Undercommons (e.g. hapticity and sensitivity : « can’t you hear them whisper one another ‘s touch ? »), in preparation for the Undercommons Event.  
The narwhal – an Arctic whale with an extraordinary ‘tooth,’ -- acted as the a more-than-human prompt for speculative exploration. As the participants lingered around a 9 foot long narwhal tooth on display in the museum, SenseLabber Mattie Sempert imparted ‘facts’ attributed to the narwhal and its tooth, esp. as a sensory organ without a protective layer of enamel.  Many of the SenseLabbers then moved outside to consider the tooth as a intercessing – or immediating --  ‘tool.’ Speculative questions emerged : What would it be like to move through the relational field with a sensory organ extending ahead one third of one’s body’s length ? What immediating capacities could this engender, or expose ?
