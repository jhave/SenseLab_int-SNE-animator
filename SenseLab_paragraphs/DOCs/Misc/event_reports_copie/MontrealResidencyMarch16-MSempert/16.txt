Well warmed-up and attuned to relational tendencies, the two day Neurodiversity event hummed with affective tones and vitalities (and reiterations of Spinoza),  expressed mostly through hand-flapping nonverbal joy. I carried these tendencies – the Spinozian capacities of « what a body can do » -- with me in an anarchival box (and my sensitive spiders’ legs) back to a Melbourne.  At an upcoming (April 18th)  SenseLab reading/gathering (to be thinking-with Massumi’s « What Animals Teach Us about Politics »),  I will hand over the anarchival box to another emissary, who will carry it’s still quivering immediating tendencies to an upcoming SenseLab Anarchiving event to be held in Sydney on May 6-7.
