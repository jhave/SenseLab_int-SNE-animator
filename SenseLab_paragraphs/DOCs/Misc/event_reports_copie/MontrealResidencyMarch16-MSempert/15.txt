Prior to the intense two day long Neurodiversity event, we immersed ourselves in group close-readings (Tito’s Plankton Dreams, and Ralph’s Gobs and Gobs of Metaphors)  and activities (cyanotype experimentation with light and shadows). I also attended Anarchival meetings (with Mayra Morales, Celine Pereira, Leslie Plumb, Csenge Kolozsvari, and fellow Berlin emissary Rett Rossi), not only in preparation for the two Neurodiversity event, but to carry tendencies to the Colloque sur l’Imprévu à l’ancienne École des Beaux-Arts, which took place immediately after the Neurodiversity event in Montreal.
