Senselab is based in Montreal, and currently engaged in a 7-year project, Immediations, for which we received the sought-after SSHRC "Partnership" grant: 3 million dollars over 7 years to join together institutional and community partners (artists and art institutions) in Europe, Australia, North America to establish Canadian artists at the vanguard of Research-Creation as a new frontier in art, on a global scale. This grant and recent developments have positioned Canada at the forefront of Research-Creation, a stream of conceptual art that allows for the idea that art is "processual": that need not only be concerned with product, but process: That the making-of art is as important as what is made.
