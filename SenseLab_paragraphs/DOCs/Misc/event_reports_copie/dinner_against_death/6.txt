Gins, who had a longstanding collaboration with Senselab and its founders, was an American conceptual artist, poet and "procedural architect" most famous for the 1997 Guggenheim show she produced with her partner Arakawa. Entitled "Reversible Destiny: We Have Decided Not To Die", the show was an architectural exploration of their procedural approach to immortality which (loosely put) involved designing living spaces and landscapes (there's a park and a condo complex in Japan, plus their house in Long Island, among other built projects).
