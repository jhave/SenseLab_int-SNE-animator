On a personal note:Â 
I'm developing a practice of public food-related installation art events, and with my creative partner Elliott Rajnovic I'll be producing a meal during the event called "Dinner Against Death". For this meal, we'll be exploring Arakawa and Gins' concept of Reversible Destiny via a shared (public) mealtime and conviviality on the Friday of the event with all the invited artistic collaborators. Dinner Against Death is part of an ongoing artistic and philosophical practice of public food events, and that I will be furthering next fall when I relocate to Vancouver and begin a Ph.D in Human Geography (with a focus on urban food systems) at SFU.
