This event in June is a two-part installation at Glasshouse (a artists' gallery/workspace in Brooklyn): 1) will be an exhibit by Erin Manning and an American collaborator, Nathaniel Stern, called Weather Patterns, that examines synaesthesia (more on that if you're interested) and 2) a four-day process of "immanent editing" in which, over the space of a few days and with the participation of invited contributors, Â we will create a book project dedicated to the work of Madeline Gins.
