This event in Brooklyn in June is of interest to the wider public - both in the sense of providing an introduction/demystification of Research-Creation as an artistic practice that we Canadians are becoming famous for on a global scale, and also because of the event itself, and the cultural and philosophical ideas we'll be exploring publicly during the event as part of Immediations and its 7-year cycle (we are now ending the first year). At the end of 2014, SenseLAb will be calling collaborators from all over the world to a three-week event in Australia, which might make a cool follow-up to the event.
