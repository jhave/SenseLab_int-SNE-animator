- Call for Work related to the Work of Arakawa and Madeline Gins -
 
Dear Colleague and Friend of Arakawa and Gins and/or their work,
 
In January 2014, Madeline Gins died. In May 2010, Arakawa did the same. Far more lastingly, however, both of them lived.
 
You are receiving this letter because we believe you knew them, and/or their work. We also believe you may have been working on something (theory, art, architecture, writing, video, performance, programming, pedagogy, storytelling, medicine, event design, city planning, financial product structuring or creative legislation) inspired by or engaging the work of these two friends, Arakawa and Madeline Gins, now gone but not done.
            
We, colleagues and friends going on, are organizing an event/process to collect and publish work related to and inspired by the work of Arakawa and Madeline Gins. We will be set up for 4 days at the Glasshouse in Brooklyn (4-7 June, 12-5pm), conducting a performative process for collecting and assembling materials for a publication. The publication, planned for release in 2015/16, is being imagined as a print + digital document an/archiving this moment of movement around  and going forward with  the work of Arakawa and Madeline Gins. This book will be dedicated to Arakawa and Madeline, with special tribute to Madeline, whose own last book, Alive forerever, not if but when, will be coming out from Open Humanities Press.
 
If you do indeed have work that engages, celebrates, challenges, applies, extends or carries on the work of Arakawa and Gins, would you consider sharing it with us, to be considered for publication in this project?
 
Please respond by replying to this email, including answers to the short questionnaire below. Please do not send any materials at this time. There will be a separate call for that. We will be in touch once we have seen the response, and keep you informed about the June event as details become concrete. This event is being organized by a group of independent scholars, artists and friends of Arakawa and Gins, with the support of the Reversible Destiny Foundation under the leadership of Joke Post and Momoyo Homma, and funded in part by the SenseLab.
 
We the organizers thank you, both retroactively and well in advance, for your contribution to furthering and forwarding the work and revolutionary vision of Arakawa and Madeline Gins.
 
Yours,   
 
Alan Prohm, Jondi Keane, Erin Manning and the SenseLab
