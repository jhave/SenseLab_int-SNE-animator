Also the story is about Research-Creation as an emergent art form:
SenseLab uses Research-Creation because we believe it has the potential to engage people in a conversation about art from which the public has historically been excluded. Of course, this art process of creating art that exists in relation to people isn't new  - Picasso said "I've never made a painting that wasn't research). However, this turn towards Research-Creation is a major movement in the art world that is trying to engage the culture in new, strident ways.
