after which they invited me to come and be their writer-in-residence for the year. I'm still figuring out what this is all about, but I do think their artistic interventions, which have an activist edge, can positively involve the public as they did during Three Mile Maal, which was hugely successful. And there's also an element of public interest because SenseLab represents Canada in international art happenings, and there's also an element of pubic-funding-at-work as Immediations holds a huge SSHERC grant...so for these and lots of other reasons, I feel like this event is worth pitching to you guys. Please let me know how I can provide more info/explore this idea in further detail with you.
