In terms of biography, Erin Manning's life is interesting - she grw up in MTL and Ottawa but as a young teenager (14 I think?) ran away from home to be an artist/squatter on the streets of Berlin, and after spending the '80s in the vanguard of the punk/Euro art world returned to Montreal and became a prof - she's now a really famous academic as well as an artist, travels the world to speak at conferences etc to trumpet Research-Creation as a "Processual" art form with the potential to democratize and transform the art world. Also still has that punk genealogy in that she believes nothing is worth doing if not to push limits, break boundaries etc. and is also an activist, involved with the Printemps Ã‰rable and all kinds of art-world mischief that involves the public and pushes boundaries abut what art is for, who can use it, etc. So she went from being a runaway/street kid to an academic/scholarly art star who represents Canada at Biennales in Sydney, Moscow etc - but still believes art is for the people. I personally find it interesting that she's an anti-establishmentarian who is beloved by the establishment...
