In the context of a "conversation" and a "story" as you so rightly put it, and in the context of that Theaster Gates segment (which I found so insprirational, and still do, after another listen - I used a description of his dinner parties as an example of the food events that part of my research for the Ph.D, thanks to that segment on Q btw) 
 
I'm pretty sure the central story/conversation here is about Research-Creation. In Canada, we're at the forefront of this major turn in the art world towards Research-Creation, and Senselab. and Erin + Brian with their enormous 7-year project Immediations (and their enormous SSHRC grant to go with it), are major players of this. All the upcoming and past events in Montreal, NY, Australia, etc could be brought up in conversation in the context of Research-Creation as an emergent art form for which the public are major stakeholders (more on Research-Creation, below).
