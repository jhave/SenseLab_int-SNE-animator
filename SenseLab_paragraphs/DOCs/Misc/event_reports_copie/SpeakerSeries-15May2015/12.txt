Juan Pablo Anaya, philosopher from Mexico presented "Humor and masochism. His general aim in this talk was to trace the importance of masochistic humor in the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari and to discuss the potentiality of this kind of humor in artistic practices. For Deleuze, the relationship between humor and masochism was built up in the literature of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. In the latter's novel Venus in furs the scrupulous application of the moral law and its punishments does not inhibit the desire of the masochist hero. Instead, the punishment serves only to demonstrate the absurdity of the law while triggering the desire that the law was supposed to forbid and conjure. This form of masochistic humor is also present in Kafka's “Letter to his father”, a work commented by both Deleuze and Guattari. In their view, his zealous embracing of the Oedipus complex allows Kafka to comically expand its consequences and demonstrate its absurdity, revealing the historical materiality that the complex was supposed to conjure and synthesize. Following this relation, the problem I want to discuss in this talk is twofold. Firstly, how are we supposed to understand what Deleuze and Guattari call the humorous thought that constitutes the literature of Masoch and Kafka? Secondly, what is the relevance of a masochistic humor for artistic creation?"
