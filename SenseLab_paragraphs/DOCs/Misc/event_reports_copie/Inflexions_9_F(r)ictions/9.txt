Description of the Activity: The collective making of a journal issue is a long process : we can consider that the creation of  that issue began July the 11th 2015, when a collective reading and discussion of the last issue of the journal (no.8 : « Radical Pedagogies ») was organized. The editing collective of the issue is composed of Hubert Gendron-Blais, Diego Gil and Joel E. Mason,  closely supported by Adam Szymansky and Ronal Rose-Antoinette. Leslie Plumb assumes the design of the issue, in collaboration with the editors. Many people of the SenseLab also participated in the peer-review process. This issue on the theme of « F(r)ictions » - a creative reflection on the tended relation between macro (actual) politics and micro (affective) politics - is in its last steps and should be launched next May. Again, the realization of an Inflexions issue was the occasion to reflect collectively on themes at the core of the Immediations project, and also gives many opportunities of contact and relations with international authors and artists (in this issue, collaborators from Europe, United States and Australia proposed contributions).
