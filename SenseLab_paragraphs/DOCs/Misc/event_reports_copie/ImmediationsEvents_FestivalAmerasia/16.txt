This partnership must be a significant physical and political movement toward the interactions with diversity local communities in relation to thoughts in action from research-creation that stems from more or less academic roots. As the AmérAsia Film Festival has several diverse facets to foster Asian content arts focusing to bring out Asian community members, who hardly come out to mingle in any Canadian cultural and arts activities as Canadian citizens in this society where they have a new status. Perhaps this must be due to their new found status in an unfarmiliar environment. As far as I know, the majority of the Asian community members that come to Montreal, a place they have chosen to come, will remains to live in dichotomy distance between Me (Asian, yellow face and black/brown hair) and Others (Canadian born, white-face and blue eyes). With this isolated feeling from the mainstream’s cultural events and activities, their minority feeling naturally draws them to participate physically and mindfully in Asian-related cultural and art events. Also we must have known that the 2nd, 3rd, 4th generation of immigrant families slowly permit their children to go into studying arts and cultural fields: the 1st or 2nd generations of the children of immigrants very often are forced to study practical fields such as law, political science, medicine, engineering and accounting. Asian communities do not differ from this stream.
