AmérAsia comes from a blend of the words “Amérique” and “Asia.” AmérAsia serves as a platform for creative and cultural networking among emerging independent Asian and/or Asian-Canadian filmmakers, professionals in the film and media arts fields, and Montrealers who are savvy about cinema and Asian culture. The festival hosts film screenings (from shorts, animation, documentaries, features to experimental); artistic workshops; video presentations and/or competitions; seminars and masterclasses about prominent film directors and their artistic visions through close-analysis of remarkable films; round-table discussions with a panel of media arts experts and so forth.
