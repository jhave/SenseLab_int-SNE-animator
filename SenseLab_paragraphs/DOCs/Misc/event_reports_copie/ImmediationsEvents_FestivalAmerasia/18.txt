Through the Immediation project, there could be a bridge to cross over both ways to open/interact/learn both the immigrant communities and local Canadians, and take this encountering bridge into deterritorialization status from a citizen of the world. All of events at the AmérAsia must resonate echo with any of the activities at the Senselab, especially with the Knots of thought project. The Practitioners’ lab is to offer an exhibition or performance space to artists who work on research-creation in media and multidisciplinary arts in favour of the works of Asian content but not limited. The Knots of thought may expand its meaning and activities in part of the Practitioners’ lab which is also open to large public and has its promotional arms in the form of social events, ‘festivity’ of the festival. In addition, the AmérAsia’s master classes, film screenings and Q&A sessions with the participated directors can expand a deeper and further research-creation about Asian film, Asian-Canadian, indigenous culture and arts, Asian communities, immigrant studies and related researchers can go on publication practices. Again, the 72 hours filmmaking challenge to open to the public was very difficult to realize. Though this brought Montreal emerging artists to experiment and explore their potential talents, this was not taken seriously. The Asian communities are one of the largest immigrant groups in this country. Through this partnership with AmérAsia and the Senselab, we can build up together for a better community that acknoledges the different groups that make up Canada.
