In the past, this event took place in cinemas, focusing on the medium of cinema. For the first time, the AmérAsia has experimented to open to various forms that is not only digital cinema but also the emergence of avant-garde and experimental contents so the festival accommodated and embraced works from various ethnicities and communities from around the world. To accommodate these forms, the festival venue shifted from cinema to a museum (MBAM) and multimedia art and cultural gallery (Center Phi). AmérAsia experimented with keeping multiple cultural functions to embrace the interest from academics (Master class, Director’s study in depth, practitioners’ labs) and general public with the forefront of Asian-Canadian communities (screenings, Q&A, 72 hours filmmaking etc.)
