Community Partners Involved (if applicable): None but the workshop was funded by another SSHRC grant, on which I am a collaborator for 2015-2016. This is an SSHRC Connection grant, “New Materialisms and Educational Research”, directed by Stephanie Springgay. 
Andrew Murphie and I were able to invite Stephanie for an 18 month residency in the School of the Arts and Media at UNSW via the network of Senselab.
