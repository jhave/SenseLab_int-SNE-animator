Each morning we began with roundtables on specific questions that had emerged from the screening series. The roundtables began with short presentations of 15 minutes by event participants and then opened up to a wider discussion open to all. On Monday afternoon, we held a masterclass with filmmaker Dominic Gagnon, whose practice involves remixing Youtube videos around particular themes. We screened Hoax Canular, where Gagnon remixed videos of teenagers in the days leading up to the “Mayan apocalypse” on 2012. Gagnon’s work on public intimacies and performance provided a powerful and suggestive basis for the discussion that followed. We then held a remixing workshop in the Arts lab of the MIRL. This research-creation approach was conceived spontaneously by event participants, with a technique inspired by Gagnon’s approach. Starting from the query “Lumiere Brother’s first film”, we set a time limit for collecting materials only by following sidebar links. We then remixed the final clip of each group after a set period of time to explore the relation between the random and the algorithmic in remix practices, producing a short video. This approach allowed for a different perspective on the question of authorship than usual discussions of transmedial participation, reworking the ties to fan-based scholarship and democratic practices, and exploring in more depth questions of the materiality of electronic media, technique and the politics of fabulation as a practice. On Tuesday, we held a second roundtable on “Fabulation and Ethics”. In the afternoon, Nadeau-Bernatchez led a workshop on the “Bonimenteur” a practice of off-screen narration. Participants engaged in a live-remix of randomly selected super-8 home movies from the MIRL collection, actively creating a fabulation in relation to this found material. A concluding conversation revisited the key ideas of the event.
