The research-creation approach allowed for a new approach to the questions generated by the screening series (which ran from Dec. 2013 to May 2015) and for making the audience into active participants. There are three deliverables emerging from the Ab-Fab series:
1) Hongisto and Thain interviewed Gagnon after his filmmaking practice. This interview will be published in French and English in Inflexions in 2015. 
2) Hongisto, Ilona, and Toni Pape. “Unexpected Artivism: The Fabulatory Function in Kumaré.” Studies in Documentary Film 9.1 (forthcoming 2015).
3) Thain, Hongisto and Pape are currently co-authoring a book on fabulation and cinema. With 3 upcoming collaborative panel presentations on this topic in Europe and North America in summer 2015, the book is planned for completion in 2016.
