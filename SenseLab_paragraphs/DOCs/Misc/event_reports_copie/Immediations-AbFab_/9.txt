Event Description: 
Absolutely Fabulated was a two-day research-creation event about films that fabulate, that create worlds in the process of filmmaking, that invent life instead of just representing it. We proposed roundtables around the notion of fabulation. These conversations were a springboard for our experimentation with various fabulatory practices.
