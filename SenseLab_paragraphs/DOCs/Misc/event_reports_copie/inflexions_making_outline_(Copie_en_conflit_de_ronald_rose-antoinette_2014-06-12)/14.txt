Three qualities of experiences that have emerged from paper-making experiments potentially resonant with precarity are explored emerge from paper-making experience the fold, the modular and the elastic.

How can we design for an activation of an event, without knowing and assuming what that 'event' will be (where 'event' is understood as the multiplicity of transdisciplinary practices that may be used to create and activate the precarity issue, in each of the respective hubs)
