Concentrated discussions emerge from this engagement with the materials (and the procedure on listening) around how to activate a collaborative process. Can a procedure be created for beginning, as well as for ending. How to 'close' an experience when working intensively in a collaborative setting. How to create procedures where the collective or the collectivity of a group of participants isn't a given. 
Questions around failure are also discussed. Can procedures be developed that proliferate the event in such a way that 'failure' is usurped by the fact that we are continually experimenting with and growing the work in response to each supposed 'failure'.
