The procedure for 'listening' is re-explored with members of the collaboration team who missed the last meeting. This time the procedure yields a very different experience (again testifying to it's authenticity as a procedure, and not a score or set of instructions). The text submitted for the issue are engaged through layering, cutups, highlighting and drawing across the paper. Some start reading to each other, video-captures weave across these activities. Some record each other speaking, an then play it back.
