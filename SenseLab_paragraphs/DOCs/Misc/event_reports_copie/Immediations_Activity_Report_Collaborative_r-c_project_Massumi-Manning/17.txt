This performance stages issues related to the "Recomposing Experience" Immediations theme concerning the relationship between nonconscious (affective) knowledge and consciousness, and howe rhythms of movement articulate movements of thought and vice versa. The text was based on quotations from Friedrich Nietzsche's Late Notebooks about these questions. The performance involved reciting the quotations while cutting two intertwined 12-meter long Moebius strips into a continuous Moebius webwork which was then used to create a sculptural installation. The performance was filmed in advance and presented at the Fesival. The film was embedded using multple screens in a reconstruction of the Moebius web shown being produced in the film.
