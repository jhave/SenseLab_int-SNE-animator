Description of the Activity: 
Discussion of techniques for immediation in collective and collaborative research creation projects.
Abstract :
This talk considers the ways in which contemporary media themselves collaborate within collaborative projects and across contexts. It will suggest that a range of emerging aesthetic techniques coalesce around the concept of ‘immediation’ and that these and art works deliberately take up the unruly contributions of media platforms in ways that open up to the novelty of their disruptiveness. It will propose that by inventing new techniques for such technologies, we can collectively create novel assemblages that allow us to not only collaborate across different knowledge and practice domains but also investigate how the process of collaboratiing might itself be transformed.
