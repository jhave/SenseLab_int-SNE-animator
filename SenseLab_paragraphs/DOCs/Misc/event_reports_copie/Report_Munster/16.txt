Grant Corbishley has been a PhD student supervised by me since 2010.  Since 2013 he has  participated in all of the Immediations activities in Australia and has been a Skype participant in Montreal and European activities. His PhD project focused on techniques of ‘minor’ listening and engagement as generative modes of creating ethico-aesthetic communities and relates to the ‘ecologies’ theme of the Immediations project. His project was an innovative research creation project that moved beyond artistic outcomes to also make social and political contributions. Grant will continue to participate in Immediations project in a postdoctoral capacity.
