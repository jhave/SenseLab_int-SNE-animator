Cut-up reading of a text (introduce the technique)
â€¦. consists in cutting up one or, in this case, two/a few related texts and distributing the passages of text among [us]. The task is to find a beginning (not the beginning of the original text) and to create a movement of thought from there, that is, to read the passages in an order that makes sense for the group. This requires [us] to deeply engage with the text or texts: You need to see how your passage begins and on what note it ends in order to make it connect. You need to listen for the openings in the passages that other people read. You have to adjust to the movement that is already under way: your passage reads differently depending on the moment you choose to insert it; other words come to stand out in light of what has gone before. In this way, the cut-up reading can create a field of attention that includes every [person] in the room.
