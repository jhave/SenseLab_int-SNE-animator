An ecology of practices is needed in order to grasp the multiple contrastive f(r)ictions surrounded by and surrounding the political in this issue. Text is sometimes able to touch the “more than” of a struggle on its own, but here other modes are needed as well. Therefore we are calling for compositions expressed by any one or all of the following modes: text, movement (video), movement (still image), and sound. Special interest will be invested in those submissions that incorporate more than one mode (written texts submitted as sound recordings, for instance). Those submitting in single modes (like text) agree to have their piece woven into the issue with other submitted modes at the editors’ discretion. 
 By composing with an ecology of practices, our intuition tells us that there may be a different grasping from the studied political struggle: a singular traction bordering the scales of micro and macro political attention that is instigated by the imaginable stitches of text, sound, and image. The potential of such a traction is in its transversal grasp, further thinking and feeling the surrounded political experience in reference to the different alternatives for life existences to come.
