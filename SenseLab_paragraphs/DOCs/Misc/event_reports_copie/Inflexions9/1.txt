In June 2015, the publishing coordinators Adam Szymanski and Ronald Rose-Antoinette met with the editors (Hubert Gendron-Blais, Diego Gil, and Joel E. Mason) of the 9th issue of Inflexions. We thought of these three because we wanted this issue to develop out of 3 areas - 1. past thinking we have done on precarity (we have quite an archive), 2. the strike here and elsewhere (politics of alterity, etc), 3. the undercommons (and the event or the becoming-event here in Montreal during the summer 2015).
