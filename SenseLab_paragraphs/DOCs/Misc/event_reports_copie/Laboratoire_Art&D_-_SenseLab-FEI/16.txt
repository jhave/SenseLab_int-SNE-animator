This series of events fostered collective research-creation experimentation involving a large international network of academics, artists, activists and thinkers associated with the SenseLab. The events were used to prototype collaborative research-creation procedures (see Enter Bioscleave) and collective experimentation in the nature and practice of research-creation events. Results flowing from the events have included special issues of the SenseLab journal, Inflexions: A Journal for Research-Creation, a SenseLab book series at Open Humanities Press, and local follow-on activities at the SenseLab and elsewhere among various subsets of its collaborators. These activities led to a formal international partnership supported by the SSHRC, entitled "Immediations: Art, Media, Event" ($3 million over 7 years, 2013-2019). The awarding of the partnership grant acknowledged the robustness of the SenseLab network and has added another level of support to its international activities.
