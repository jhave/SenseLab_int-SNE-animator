B - Into the Midst (2012)
Into the Midst was a five-day collaborative research-creation workshop in the SATosphere, the Society for Art and Technology’s interactive immersive projection environment. The workshop featured hands-on experimentation toward exploring the potential for this environment to host the emergence of new forms of experience. The experimentation was accompanied by explorations in the philosophy of experience aimed at fashioning a vocabulary adequate to the emergent immersive potential.  Key issues the workshop has addressed: how interactive live movement within the space can modulate the experience of the projected space (and vice versa) in ways that alter habitual modes of perception; how the relationship between inside and outside spaces might be modulated, using the SAT building and its immediate urban surroundings as raw material; how frustrations of expectations regarding the responsiveness of interactive systems might lead, positively, to new qualities of aesthetic experience.  The workshop was preceded by group discussions and preparatory work using online collaborative tools. The results of the workshop have been presented performatively to the pubic in the SATosphere. The workshop was collectively led and organized by the SenseLab network.
