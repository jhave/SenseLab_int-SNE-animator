Description of the Activity: The activity consisted in the creation of an ephemeral space of experimentation, creation and discussion in the heart of the Quartier des spectacles, a highly productive and controlled space in the city. In direct relation with the theme of the issue (“Radical Pedagogy”), some sculpture and ephemeral installations had been created for the event, and some artistic material (color paper, chalks, pens, scissors) was available for the participants and the people passing by. The main objective was to exemplify concretely and in a public space the notion of “Radical Pedagogy”, which opens a space for modes of thinking that are not usually considered by institutions. In that sense, the collaboration with the Laboratoire des récits du soi mobile, which aims to integrate itself in real daily life of the mobile but often invisibilized people of the city by opening a space for a ‘’narrative democracy’’ for those who didn’t have access to public recognition, was a great opportunity to deepen and transversalize the valorization of new modes of thinking and learning.
