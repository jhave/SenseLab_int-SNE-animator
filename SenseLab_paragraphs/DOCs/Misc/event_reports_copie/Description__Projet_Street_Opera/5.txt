The initiator of the street opera project is Maud Watel Kazak, a French interdisciplinary performer and creator who founded the WatKaz collective in Paris (http://watkaz.wordpress.com). In Montreal she organized an outdoor performance around Beckett's Waiting for Godot play on top of Mont-Royal in March.
