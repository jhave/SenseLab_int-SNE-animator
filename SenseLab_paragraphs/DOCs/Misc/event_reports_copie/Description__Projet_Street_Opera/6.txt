The tentative structure for the 3 acts street opera was inspired to Maud by the unpublished/unfinished novel Ronald (one of the coordinators of SenseLab) wrote a couple years ago. The theatrical adaptation presents itself as a performative reflexion on the fragmented life experience of a female heroin with polyamorous relational practice and alcohol dependence. Not so far from what we did with the Waiting for Godot performance, the main character will be performed through different mediums (dance, music, acting, singing and more) and by different people (individuals or groups), which will allow for interdisciplinary resonance. Also there will be different (probably 3) indoor and outdoor locations, which will enable to activate the urban space as well as different performative configurations.
