The creative process is organized in two phases. From now until early June, the different groups (dancers, musicians, comedians) will gather among themselves to attune and elaborate their parts. Then, between June 10th and 20th there will be 10 days of intensive rehearsing, in sub-groups and altogether (obviously!). Although the groups will gather separately in the beginning, I would like to emphasize the collaborative and interdisciplinary aspects both in the creative process (we will create bridges between the different groups in late May/June), but also for the performers (a dancer can also have singing lines, a comedian can dance…).
