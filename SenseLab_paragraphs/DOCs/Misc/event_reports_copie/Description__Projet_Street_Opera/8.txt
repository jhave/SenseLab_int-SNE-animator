The Senselab is currently in the process of producing a street opera for the performance studies conference Encuentro. The Street Opera will continue to engage with questions around how to produce collectivites that we have raised in our reading group, Knots and Movements of Thought, Public Feelings, Anarchiving: Precarity andBioscleave: Entering the Event. The Street Opera will activate the space outside of Usine C in order to produce a piece of theatre that engages the larger Montreal community who may otherwise not have access to cultural institutions such as Usine C.
 
The work will explore questions around the representability of melancholy, and the capacity to which melancholy can be made felt in public spaces.  It will combine street theatre, dance, live music and video projection. The Senselab is holding weekly rehearsals that utilize improvisation to create the scenes.
