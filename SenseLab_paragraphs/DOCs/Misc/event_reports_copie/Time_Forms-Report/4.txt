Our participants were drawn from both academic and artistic practices, exploring arts such as dance, music, cinema, digital media, installation art, as well as research practices that take innovative approaches to the analytical challenges of time forms in art. As befits a research-creation event on aesthetic experience, participation not only involved the presentation of artworks or research findings, but participation in and reflection on aesthetic experience itself. Part of the eventâ€™s research program, then, developed a dialogue across discrete events to determine how time works in aesthetic experience, to develop new research and pedagogical models for exploring these questions, and for understanding how art works on the bodies and experiences of spectators/ participants over time.
