Innovative in both form and content, this event asked participants (presenters and the audience) to give careful consideration to the time of presentation and performance itself. Each presenter proposed a “time form” for sharing their work, to make the event itself a site of creative experimentation and heterogeneous experiences of time.  The organizers curated these proposals into an event that dynamically enacted the key issues arising from the temporalities of aesthetic experience itself, outside of the traditional structure of a research-conference. We alternated condensed and discrete experiences, such as roundtables on the body in time as artistic medium, with durational and mobile temporal events, such as an Acceleration running tour of public art and interactive citywalks, as well as looped and discrete presentations of new media installations, video, sculptures, live performances and more.  Thus the event simultaneously addressed both the “time forms” of contemporary art and research (i.e. what forms of aesthetic expression foreground their temporal dimension, and to what end?), and also the question of how time forms (i.e. how time itself is a force giving shape and content to aesthetic experience that is different from everyday time, work time and clock time).
