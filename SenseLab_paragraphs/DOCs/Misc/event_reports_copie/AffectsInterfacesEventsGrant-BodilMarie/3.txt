Activity Type: 
The research project will in its 3-year of funding deliver research results in 8 sub-projects engaged with affective interfaces and events. We work with close readings groups, workshops (text-production and design-production), several seminars and one concluding conference with external partners. So far Immediations-partners Andrew Murphie and Lone Bertelsen has visited us for an intensive seminar in Aarhus, December 7, 2015.
