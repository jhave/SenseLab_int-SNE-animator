Description of the Activity: 100-250 
This event consisted in meeting and discussing diverse techniques of thought, including some of the qualities of sinaesthetic thought among Senselabbers and out non-speaking guests with autism. After doing a collective reading of Tito Mukhopadhyay's book Plancton Dreams (recently published by Immediations press) participants formulated questions for Tito, which he answered as written text, both on the Hub and in person. After Tito's suggestion we did a close reading of a passage from Spinoza's Ethics and Deleuze's writing on the same text. where Tito participated by writing poems alongside the philosophical discussion, making for a multi-dimensional reading of and modally diverse way of entering the text. The event also included a cyanotype workshop and movement practices with soft architectural objects. This event was central to the Senselab's concern for developing research techniques that are not situated within given disciplinary or learning structures but that emerge through a diversity of practices and techniques of thought. The importance of this event is visible in the continued interest in developing techniques of withness with some of the relations and techniques that emerged in the event both at the senselab, on the Senselab hub and through continued involvement in this process across the hubs over Skype. (This event was particularly important for my independent research in that it proposed a way to develop research formats with emergent conceptual and asethetic practices, a concern that is central to my PhD in artistic research).
