Description of the Activity: 100-250 words. 
The Avoca Project is centred on an historically important but initially dilapidated house in a small town in regional Australia which is increasingly, and visibly, subject to the effects of shifting weather patterns with climate change and of encroaching globalisation.
The house is subject to questions of mediation here enacted through art actions as it slowly becomes habitable. This is a habitation that needs to be shared with the possums, termites, bees, mice, bats, mosquitoes, snakes, spiders, birds, moulds, water and assorted humans that come and go. 
How might this house, with its visibly European history, its weathering over 200 years of well-meaning attention and extreme neglect, the attempts at dressing it in the fabrics of bourgeois attendance, become central to questions of its own becoming ? And how might all of these be affected by the ever lengthening droughts that leave it each summer without water and struggling with the real prospect of fire.
There is the engagement through physical repair and support, enabling all involved to think differently about what constitutes convenience, and comfort within an ecological framework. 
There are also the art projects that simultaneously arise from these concerns. Most recently these have included Prelude for Painters and Prepared House, whereby 10 painters work together to paint the facade of the house over 2 days (April 2016), Invited for exhibition at the Pompidou Centre in 2017 by Richard Demarco for his archive exhibition. 
The book, Painting the House ; 10 years of The Avoca Project (provisional title) has received $10,000 from RMIT University and provision of 4 months research leave to write it.
