This performance was an attempt to investigate musically the affect of the 2015 strike in Quebec.  Consisting of guitar, electric piano, cello, and performed audio samples from the strike, we developed a 50-minute improvisational score that worked through the different affective scenes constitutive of the 2015 strike moment. In this way, we attempted to tend an emerging movement of thought, a key concept at the Senselab. We wrote the score to account for the primacy of improvisation, thereby embracing Senselab’s intuition that events should not be predetermined but rather moved through and with. This performance was in dialogue with Senselab’s involvement in the 2015 strike, as many in the collective chose to walk on the streets to see, witness, and co-create with the gathered group. We were also interested in how sonic and affective reformulations of the strike could access researchable moments of intensity uncategorizable by traditional humanities inquiry.
