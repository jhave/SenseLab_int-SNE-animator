This was a pre-event for the end of 2014 major events for the grant. It followed on from the March 2014 event in Sydney at UNSW Art and Design. Part of it was planning, during which we also began to explore the idea of what a « minor planning » might be—that is, a planning process very much based on process philosophy. We also explored questions around listening (affective listening), the way in which cultural history comes into process (via Grant Courbishley ‘s raising of the Maori question of what your « waters » might be, and group work and questions of precarity and publishing and the minor archive, which linked through to work in the other hubs in Montréal and Europe. We spent some time linked to the hub in Montréal and exchanging exercises in processual group organisation.
