Thought in the Act: where the speculative meets the pragmatic; where thought is on the move, and the movement is thinking on the run; where the stakes are real and present, and the destination is to be invented. This series seeks projects that gear philosophical thinking into practices of research and creation in other domains; and conversely, that see philosophy itself as a searching practice of creative concept-making. Thinking in action: experimental thinking-across, toward parts as yet unknown. Speculative pragmatism: like having a word at the tip of the tongueâ€”when it could just as easily be an act.
