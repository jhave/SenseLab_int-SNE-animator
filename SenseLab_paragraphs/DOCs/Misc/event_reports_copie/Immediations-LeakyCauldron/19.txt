20:30 - 21:30 - film / video projection
The short film of the night was edited from pictures shoot this same night with several IPhones. The experience to watch a small short film archiving this event was emphazing 2 aspects :
	•	the public space around was on the screen as it’s constituted our direct environment,
	•	the proximity with time and the body activities that just passed, the sounds coming from not a long past.
