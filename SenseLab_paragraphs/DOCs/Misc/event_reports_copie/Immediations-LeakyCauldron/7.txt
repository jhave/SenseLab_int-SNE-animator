Community Partners Involved: 
The Darling Foundry is an artist center which is not officialy partner in the Immediations project. However some SenseLab members had developed links with the Darling Foundry. Futhermore, it is open to welcome activities and events around the public space the artists inhabit every summer. This space is called Place Publique. Indeed the street in front of the Darling Foundry becomes pedestrian from end of April until end of October each year since several years.
