Exhaustion is not only the subject of this workshop, but also informs its practice. The general proposition is to activate forms of knowledge production that engage and work with exhaustion.
This is to tackle the sometimes exhausting aspects of conference participation itself. Each participant will be given a full hour to present something that should be work in progress. This hour can be filled in any way the participant sees fit (presentation, performance, exercise, discussion, etc.).
