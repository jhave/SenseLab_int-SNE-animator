Screening Series Absolutely Fabulated
Absolutely Fabulated is a screening series organized by co-applicant Alanna Thain, Immediations postdoctoral fellow Toni Pape, and Senselab postdoctoral fellow Ilona Hongisto. The series approached the question of immediation by presenting documentary films that do not simply represent or ‘document’ a preexisting content, but that contribute to the creation of new realities. The central concept explored in this concept is that of fabulation, developed by philosophers Henri Bergson and Gilles Deleuze, understood as a creative relation between filmmaker, camera, ‘social actor,’ and the viewer.
