Glasshouse-google docs collective writing piece, Spring 2014 - ongoing
Mayra, Ramona, Leslie, Csenge, Justy
A collective writing process was initiated to develop some vocabularies and ways of moving with emergent ideas and concepts that had surfaced from the ongoing M.O.T./K.O.T. events. While participating in various movement exercises and conversations at Glasshouse, a google docs was opened to continue conversations with M.O.T./K.O.T. collaborators that were in other locations (such as Hungary and Melbourne). This technological platform allowed for people to write simultaneously into the same document, while in shared or different spaces, across multiple time zones and availabilities. As such polyrhythms for entering were facilitated, in a way that aligned with the explorations of M.O.T/K.O.T. movement and materials. Authorship was undone and pleated. The language was moved with porosity, micro-granular shifts exploring the thresholds of repetition and difference. The negative space within the google docs formatting (the white areas around the words) was massaged into the rhythm of the writing/reading experience of a page, with an attention equal to the words written. Multiplicities and recursive loops were used as techniques to resist settling, opening up undercommons for fugitivity of thought.
