The After Lygia experience began by entering its 7ft black cube, with 2 internally segmented spaces. The orientation of the entrances and the box as a whole, held two propositions for entering the SenseLab. One entailed navigating through it via parting an opening in its elasticized entrance, which was made up of wide black elastic bands that ran parallel and overlapped, but were not fused together. Visitors would need to both pull apart and push through these elastic bands to enter. Inside presented a momentary darkness consisting of two chambers filled with white balloons, similar yet different, before stepping out through the elasticized exit directly into the lab. The alternative way to enter the SenseLab was to circumvent the black cube, yet it still required traversing a narrowed threshold with a set of short sideway movements*.
