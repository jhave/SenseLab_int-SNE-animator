From early fall 2013, we began asking such questions as: What kind of alternative techniques can we craft for entering events? And how can we move to foreground the techniques invented in the immediacy of the event’s becoming and unfolding? These questions have generated an appetite for multiplicity in the qualities of our invitations, moving from the modalities of formal text based announcements, launches and ‘talks’ to flocking games, rhythms (such as skipping) and non-verbal (yet no less boisterous) propositions such as entering After Lygia.
