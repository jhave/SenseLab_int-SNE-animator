This writing developed a collective language and ‘way’ for entering writing collaboratively, that later facilitated the development for proposals for external events and conferences, including the Cultural Studies Association of Australasia Conference hosted at the University of Wollongong, but the writing was not initiated in service of writing a proposal solely or specifically. It emerged from an existing appetition to move across material generating out of our movement practices, M.O.T., the senselab reading groups, and other close-reading activities across our respective practices.
