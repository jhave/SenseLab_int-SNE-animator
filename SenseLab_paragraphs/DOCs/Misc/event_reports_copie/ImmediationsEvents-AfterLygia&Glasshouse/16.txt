Two months later, After Lygia was reconfigured into After, After Lygia. The 7ft black cube was rotated onto its side and the dividing passage between its inner chambers was redesigned. The installations interior was again filled with balloons. At first, the installation appeared unchanged, however upon approaching, it became evident that its vertical entrance had moved. It was now horizontal along the floor and entering would require a new technique, one that included a form of crawling or moving horizontally along the floor to negotiate the elasticized opening in its new location. Once inside, feeling the way through would trump any techniques that were gathered from a previous experience in the blackened interior because this configuration no longer proposed an upright biped strategy.
