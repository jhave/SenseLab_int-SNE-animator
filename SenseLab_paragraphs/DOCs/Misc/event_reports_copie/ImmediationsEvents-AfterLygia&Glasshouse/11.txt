A group of people gather to recollect and re-assemble from experiential memory, a sculpture installation by Lygia Clark that we all experienced at MOMA. It is one week later. The proposition to activate a live architecting of what a collective recollection can do is taken up. The group agrees to build a replica of the sculpture installation based on the nexus of our collective recollections. After Lygia is constructed over a five day period and inaugurates visitors to the SenseLab’s space, at it’s entrance, during the 2014 Encuentro Conference and the book launching of « Thought in the Act », Erin Manning, Brian Massumi, 2014.
