Description of the Activity: 
During the discussion held at this Reading Group, the question of creativity is treated through the notion of chance, spontaneity and life agency. Peirce’s definition of mind brings forth the question of growth, central in process philosophy. This concept opens the discussion to Whitehead’s concept of reason (Function of Reason) where the author questions the definition of life simply as persistence, but complicates it by the concept of appetite. Both concepts (appetite and mind) seem to be what troubles, complicates, multiplies… this agitation emerging through relationality. This perspective points out to a with-ness of mind in the world that contributes to it as a quality of experience that is coupling (at different degrees, in different ways, under different circumstances). Also, this text offered an opportunity to discuss the main concepts at the core of the SenseLab activites, which are relation and pragmatism.
