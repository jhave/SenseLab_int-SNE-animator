This workshop thus offers an introduction to a performance training technique that emphasizes physical and vocal skills, called “Everyday Virtuosity” . It develops a pragmatic and experiential approach to training the body for social flexibility and neutrality. Our point of departure is: we are always communicating even when we are silent. A series of practical exercises and hands-on work will be offered as way of opening up physical and vocal possibilities. These communicative and metamorphic skills are being taught with the intention of being able to use them in real life situations. We will discuss strategies for skill utilization in practical settings and outline resources for continued development. Awareness of our own communicative capacities will emerge through our own experiences and train observant techniques through watching our colleagues and learning how to give effective feedback.
