From June 2013 to May 2014 the EU-Hub members specified their research topic Urban Fabric for of Immediations’ first phase “re-composing experience”. We deal with the question of embodied and mediated experience as part of the urban fabric. Jonas Fritsch and Bodil Marie Stavning Thomsen published a first academic text on the topic: “An Ethology of Urban Fabric(s)”, A Peer-Reviews Journal About Post-Digital Research 3.1 (2014). EU-Hub-members participate in this year’s Swiss Artistic Research Network conference in Geneva (Nov. 2014) and facilitate a workshop at the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design (July 2014) – both in relation to Immediations.
