Description of activation 3:
Then following, was a series of experiments for techniques that depersonalize displacement while retaining a quality of inclusiveness. These experiments began with material and propositions inspired from Lygia Clark’s 1960-70’s work with relational objects.
                                   	
Air was inflated into numerous plastic bags and knotted to form ‘air pockets’ (a whole/hole holding in s/pl-ace). The infrathin membrane of plastic provided enough thickness to encapsulate air as both space and as a temporary objects that were independent from a pre-knowable use. Small rounded river rocks or tangerines were then placed onto the air pockets sinking into cradled positions by displacing the air contained inside the plastic. Our hands also displaced the air in these unstructured forms. The thin membrane of plastic and the ease with which thresholds of varied pressure could be applied to the trapped air inside the bags, allowed for cascades of sensation that spiraled a sense of relational movement. 
These small gestures created multiple inflated objects and our experiments in foregrounding displacement soon shifted into somewhat of its opposite, placement. These inflated objects became caringly inserted to fill in gaps and contours found along the body and the architectural surround. Participants worked alone, in pairs and in groups. Body and architectural appendages emerged inventing propositions that extended what constituted a body and what constituted as the space between bodies. The infrathin membrane of plastic provided the material to alter this thickness of the space, and with it, the relational negotiations of what a body can do, in effect, shifting the norms of what is considered to be private space and the architectural surrounding space.
