Acting as both an incubator for further collective and collaborative research, members and representatives from both Senselab and The Design Studio for Social Intervention (DS4Si) re-purposed the contents and space of a kitchen of a private residence which was soon to be vacated by the familyâ€™s upcoming move. Collecting, inventorying, and re-composing the given ingredients left within the kitchen, participants created a meal which embodied and investigated the role of self-organisation: if there is no chef leading the brigade, how do the disparate ingredients blend themselves into that which we recognize as a meal.
