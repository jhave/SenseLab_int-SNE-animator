Interested in both the implications of working within a local ecology as well as the ethics related to sourcing ingredients from local/global providers the partners engaged with Brooklyn Green Market among other contributors in order to prepare a collection of ‘recombinant salads’. Responding to the existent conditions of the gathering (mobile, convivial, conversational, fluid) the partners designed dishes to be served in individual containers which may or may not contain all of the items needed for a full meal - leading to not only discovery but also encouraging exchange, dialogue and providing a route for conviviality with other participants.
