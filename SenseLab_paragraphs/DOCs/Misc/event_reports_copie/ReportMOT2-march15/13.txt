- Moved by a phrase in the discussion: "going off the record of myself", and to channel some kind of closing to the event, Anique invited people to write down how they might go off the record of themselves. Then we asked them to put a probability of that occurring on it. We then collected them all and shared them amongst us, each becoming custodian of the other persons going off the record.
