- Ten people arrived incrementally. A piano was played and conversations unfolded.
- People began to look at photos. Gently, we invited people to begin looking at the images in proposition 1, scattered around the room. 
- A pair and group of discussion around an image formed relatively swiftly. Others took quite some time to 'choose' an image. A first group ended up doing a tasting plate and graph of our souls, as well as playing with a soul bartering system. Another group was talking about layers of knowing and perception. And another how the false is all in the framing, not the appearance of truth. There was movement, discussion and diagramming. 
- Then, a group emerged to fake a reality for the second proposition. More of us joined in the discussion. Separately, we had invited a 1st time attendee, a MFA student, to consider the third proposition of inventing a character based on where our discussion had gone. She ended up joining two others in discussion around that. They then joined the rest of us in discussions around statistics and tragedy, transforming the quantitative into the qualitative, and faking statistics as probable realities. We also discussed the idea that an enormous quantity of data (virtual) is neutralizing the real; about the presumption that not knowing our “self” puts us in an imposture position; and we asked ourselves whether imposture could also be played by children. We came to the conclusion that, if there is imposture in children, then it is for sure different from the adult imposturing.
