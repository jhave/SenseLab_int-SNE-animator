Reading-groups are usually announced 3 to 4 weeks in advance on our web-based platforms (Twitter & Facebookâ€”see images below). People can always assist to the readings via Skype. We always do our best to audio-record the sessions and make the files available to our partners and multimedia followers (on-demand). The reading-groups are free of charge. Everyone is welcome!
