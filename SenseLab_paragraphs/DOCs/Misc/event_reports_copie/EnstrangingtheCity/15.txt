Following a walk in the neighborhood with a group of Mile End residents, Adeola Enigbokan, in collaboration with Ronald Rose-Antoinette, presented her projects such as Archiving the City and Enstranging the City in relation to the concept of “enstrangement.” The latter refers to a process or act of endowing “strangeness” to an everyday object or situation through modifying one’s perception or by accident.
