I’d like to thank Erin Manning who makes this residency real and all people I’ve met in Montreal who join the welcoming dinner, informal and formal meetings and the leaving drink during my stay in January. I’d like also to thank the Concordia University and Hexagram to let me run the workshops, with video and sound equipment’s and a dedicated room. There were the best conditions to achieve this residency.
