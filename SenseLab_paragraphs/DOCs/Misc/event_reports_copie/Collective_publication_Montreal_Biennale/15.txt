Essay for the catalogue of the 2014 Biennale de Montréal entitled  L'avenir / Looking Forward, (Montréal: Musée d'art contemporain, 2015), pp. 42-49, 171-180. The essay was written as a research-creation experimentation. It was composed in round-robin fashion, framed by certain pre-specified constraints designed to create a collective voice not traceable to any individual. The composition was fully collective from start to finish, with no voice of authority in charge. The content is directly related to Immediations grant research and ideas that have collectively emerged from it regarding the role of art in knowledge formation and the place of the aesthetic.
