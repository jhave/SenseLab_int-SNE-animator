Event Series Description: The series of events proposed by the European hub of Immediations foregrounds the concept of urban fabric. More specifically, the work of the European hub focuses on water as an urban fabric. The participants explore the ecological, social, and political roles that water plays in the contemporary geopolitical situation (droughts and extreme weather due to climate, boat refugees, etc.). How can these pressing issues be rethought through the concept of immediation?
