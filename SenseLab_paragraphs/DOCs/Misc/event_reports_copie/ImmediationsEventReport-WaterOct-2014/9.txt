Event Description: 
This event took the role of water and water management in the Netherlands as a historical as well as conceptual background. The purpose of reading sessions was to determine the concrete ways in which social collectives interact with water. In research-creation workshops, we undertook experiments to bring our sometimes latent but problematic relations with water into experience. These experiments were collectively explored and discussed in terms of their potential for new modes of knowing and teaching water as an urban fabric.
