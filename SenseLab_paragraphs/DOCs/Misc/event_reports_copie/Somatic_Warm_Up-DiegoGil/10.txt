We were experimenting with different somatic activities in order to sketch a diagram of what could be physically needed to do prior to conceptual work. These were practices that we could use before our collective readings groups or for our individual use, for instance: to bridge the jump into our books in the mornings. We were experimenting with specific modes of organizing attention through slow movements like walking, seating and rolling, so that we could activate a relation between different physiological systems and the environment.  We used somatic techniques subtracted from Body Mind Centerin and Alexander methodology and we combined with conceptual propositions, drawings, dialogues and play with design objects.
