The meeting format is informal, and includes a presentation either by N Khalili-Mahani, or an invited expert guests, covering the historical context of the topic, and then assisting the audience to contextualize the contemporary questions within the bigger historical, political and economic context. Najmeh Khalili-Mahani is a Biomedical Engineer, a Neuroscientist and a media-studies graduate, and uses knowledge from these three fields to provide a multi-contextualized perspective to how body, technology and society intersect and interact to form persona, philosophies and ultimately politics.
