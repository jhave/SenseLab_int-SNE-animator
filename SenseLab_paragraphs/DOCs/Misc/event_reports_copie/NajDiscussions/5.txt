Whereas events such as TED-talks and Cafe Scientific are great initiatives that bring the academics and the public under one roof, the transfer of knowledge remains mainly top-down and uni-directional. The ambition of this project is to break this hierarchical norm, anonymize the "scientist" by putting him/her on a "Humanitiesl" stage and let the conversation happen (events last between 2-3 hours). The event aims to provide the general public with access to current topics in neuroscience while providing them an opportunity to ask (any) questions in an informal and inviting setting. This event also provides the speakers a chance to discover the meaning of their laboratory work for average citizens.
