Founded by Dr Najmeh, Khalili Mahani in July 2013, and sponsored by Senelab, Brain, Self and Society is a knowledge-transfer group that gathers around "popular" neuroscience topics, to discuss the philosophical, sociological and political implications of "Neurotalk", and "neuroeconomics". The meeting idea was inspired by the work of the prominent sociologist, Professor Nikolas Rose in the London School of Economics (currently heading the Department of Social Science, Health and Medicine at Kingâ€™s College London), and is a response to the growing presence of the neurocentric discourse in different academic fields, as well as media and even economy.
