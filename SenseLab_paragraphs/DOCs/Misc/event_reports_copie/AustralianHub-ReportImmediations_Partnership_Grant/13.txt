4) Anarchiving: Precarity 
The Australian hub participated in this event from Melbourne from April 25–27 at the Design Hub, RMIT. The event developed improvisation and listening techniques that began in the previous workshop (Minor Practices) and shared these with the Montreal and European hubs vis video conferencing. Australian participants used these techniques in relation to texts and protocols received from the Montreal hub in order to generate new sets of video, audio, image and written material for ‘an archive’; that is a living repository of the partnerships past, current and ongoing activities toward research-creation. This shared material will become the Australian hub’s ‘book’ contribution toward ‘anarchiving precarity’ and will be exhibited as part of the archive of the partnership’s activities during November and December, 2014 in Australia 
Workshop closed to the public: 14 (Australian) participants (3 institutional reps, 1 community partners, 2 affiliated Senselab members, I postdoctoral fellow, 7 postgraduate students)
