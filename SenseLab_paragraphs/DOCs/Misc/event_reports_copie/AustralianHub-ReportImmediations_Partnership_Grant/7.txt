These meetings have focussed on discussion of theme one of Immediations – “Recomposing Experience”. Discussion is initiated via circulation of conceptual and practice-based texts and examples ahead of time and major areas to emerge so far are: minor art and research practices, affective listening, cross-modal attunement, improvisation and performance, affective environments.
