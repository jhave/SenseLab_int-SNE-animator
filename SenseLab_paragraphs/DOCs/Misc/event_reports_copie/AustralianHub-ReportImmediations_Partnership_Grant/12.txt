3) Minor practices workshop
This was a workshop for all Australian hub participants hosted by the National Institute for Experimental Arts, UNSW in Sydney. The purpose of the workshop was to develop a series of techniques loosely structured around the concept of ‘minor practices’ of listening and improvisation. These techniques will become the basis for a month-long series of events, symposia and exhibitions for all participants in the Immediations partnership during November and December, 2014. The workshop also set aside a planning evening to discuss the involvement of community partners in hosting and planning the year-end events.
Workshop: Closed to public
Workshop numbers: 13 (3 institutional reps, 2 community partners, I postdoctoral fellow, 2 affiliated Senselab member, 5 postgraduate students)
