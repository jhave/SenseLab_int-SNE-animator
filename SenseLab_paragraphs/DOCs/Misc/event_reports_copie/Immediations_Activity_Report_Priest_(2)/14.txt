As part of my post-doctoral work I organized a reading session at the SenseLab that focused on earworms (songs that get stuck in your head) and the contagious qualities of sound. This was coupled with my participation in « Knots of Thought, » where I not only presented my developing research on earworms and auditory hallucinations but made use of the format form collective thinking to explore certain elements of the phenomenon that fell outside the discursive purview of my study.
