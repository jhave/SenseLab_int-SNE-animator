In the Spring of 2013, the Senselab published a special issue on experimental architects and contemporary artists Arakawa and Gins in Inflexions 6. In this issue emerging scholars and established authors explore the historical, performative and ethical aspects of Arakawa and Gins' work and, each from their unique personal, academic or practical experiences, discuss how Arakawa and Gins may guide us to live life on new terms. This issue parted from our standard Inflexions format as it included a Keynotes and a Tribute section. The keynote texts offer insight into the way that Arakawa and Gins' work informs positions within and across a range of research areas in an effort assist anyone embarking on daily research.  The tributes are in honour to Arakawa (who died on May 18, 2010) to recognize the significance of his work by offering personal accounts and speculations upon where Arakawa and Gins work may lead. Authors involved in this special issue include: Brian Massumi, Gregg Lambert, Tom Conley, David Kolb and Jondi Keane among others. A journal launch for the issue was held at DHC art, a Montreal art gallery where the journal was projected. The issue can be accessed here: http://www.inflexions.org/issues.html#i6
