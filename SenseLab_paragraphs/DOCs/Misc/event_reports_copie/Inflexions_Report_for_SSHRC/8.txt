The Senselab is also currently in the process of publishing our second out of series effort, Anarchiving: Precarity. This issue stems from our event of the same name, that brought together artists and writers in a research-creation project for creating event-based procedures for crafting the creative potential immanent to precarity. The result of this publication with be a choreographic object emerging from a set of procedures rather than a traditional journal issue structured around articles. The publication itself is taking place in phases, and we collectively build it on a monthly basis. These further making sessions are co-ordinated through three continent Skype with our hubs in Europe and Australia.
