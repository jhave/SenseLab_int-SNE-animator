In April 2014, Inflexions 7: Animating Biotechnology was published. This issue’s Node section was edited by guest editors Adam Nocek and Phillip Thurtle, with the Tangents section edited by Marie-Pier Boucher and Adam Szymanski. The issue brought together leading scholars approaching biotechnology from a humanities perspective, including Richard Doyle, Eugene Thacker, Deborah Levitt and Henning Schmidgen. The Tangents section published a number of artistic works that in some way animate biophilosophical concepts, including works by established artists such as dancer Hiroki Umeda, contemporary artist David Zink-Yi and a number of experimental architects including Greg Lynn. The issue was launched at Artexte, a Montreal art archive in April, 2014. The launch was an event in its own right, featuring a tour of the Artexte community partner archive space and multiple computer stations where readers could interact with the journal’s interactive online design on site.
