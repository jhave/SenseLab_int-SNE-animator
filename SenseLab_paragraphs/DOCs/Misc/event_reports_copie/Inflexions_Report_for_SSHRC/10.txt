We encourage inter/trans/non disciplinary work, both individual and collaborative, that is not content to critique or negate existing models but affirms the value of creation in the research process. We also encourage authors to embrace the technical possibilities of the Web, and to test the limits of of academic writing, by considering integrating their writing with other forms of expression.
