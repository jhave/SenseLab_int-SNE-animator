In summer 2013, Inflexions published Into the Midst, the Senselabâ€™s first experiment in our new 'out of series' journal issues. Authorship within these issues was treated as a collective experience, and contributions to an issue engaged by the design as a chorus. The design of this particular issue is a collaboration between Erin Manning and Leslie Plumb.
