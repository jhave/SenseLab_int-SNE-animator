The NODE features a group of conceptually interlinked pieces that engage with a particular problematic in a variety of different modes, including but not limited to academic essays. TANGENTS present individual tangential contributions. Tangents pieces strike off in directions all their own, and resonate across their divergences. Taken together, they suggest potential connections with each other and the issue Node.
