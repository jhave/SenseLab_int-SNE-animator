This issue consists of responses from the Senselab Collective and participants of the Into the Midst event that occurred in October of 2012. Into the Midst was a five-day collaborative research-creation workshop in and around the SATosphere, the Society for Art and Technology's interactive immersive projection environment (aka 'The Dome'). These responses are designed in a way where they interact with one another in an experimental web format that reconfigures the positionality of the texts in conjunction with user navigation through the site. The issue can be accessed at the URL: http://www.inflexions.org/intothemidst.html. The texts are interlaced with images from the Senselabâ€™s work in and around the SAT. There were 26 different people whose writing went into the production this issue.
