Inflexions 8 is due out in March 2015. The theme for this issue is Radical Pedagogy, a theme that resonates with concerns that have long been held with the Senselabâ€™s efforts to find new modes of evaluation for research-creation within the academy. The issue grows out of a number of Sensleab efforts to create alternative venues for the presentation and dissemination of research. Some of these outlets include the Knots of Thought series, the monthly reading group, and the workshops with Adriana Disman from the School of Making-Thinking. The editors of the Node for this issue are Alanna Thain, Mike Hornblow, and Mayra Morales. The editors for the Tangents are Gerko Egert, Katve-Kaisa Kontturi and Ilona Hongisto. The Nodes are expected to contain essays by Ronald Rose-Antionette, Erik Bordeleau and Silvia Pinto-Coehlo.
