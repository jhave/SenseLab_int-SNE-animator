What: An encounter on radio and on the street. From one side, a felted text, passages of others writings stripped of their citational armor; from another side, a classical guitar given to a son by a father after the father loses his ability to play because of a stroke. Playing and reading simultaneously, Inherited Instruments is both drawing out and thwarting the other's best loved way of sounding themselves.
When and Where: Tonight (Sunday, July 26th) from 9pm to 10pm, turn an analog knob to 104.4FM (in a two square block radius of FOFA) or see the broadcast from the street (the north side of Ste. Catherine between Mackay and Guy).
