The Art of Imposturing was the Movements of Thought series earlier this year here in Montreal. In order to consider alternate, or even invisible, activist methods, we explored: movements such as subversive affirmation (Eg. The Yes Men); concepts and methodologies such as speculative pragmatism, immanent critique (Manning and Massumi), depersonalising trust (Massumi), transindividualism and irony; as well as tactics including embodying certain codes to infiltrate political circles. "Cuts Make the Country Better" explores how "in 2011, a right-wing coalition government announced drastic cuts in public funding for the arts in the Netherlands. Artists and cultural workers share their views on the effects of the cutbacks as well as on the strategies, both political and artistic, that took shape thereafter. The projection will be followed by a discussion."
