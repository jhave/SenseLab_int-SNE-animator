It is in this context that we would like to bring together two recently published books that both present a radically anti-representational conception of politics. Each of them insist, in its own way, on a form of fugitive and sensible experience of a “wild common” that is about rhythms and resonances and escapes all forms of privative appropriation. Coming from the field of Black Studies, Stefano Harney and Fred Moten’s The Undercommons (Autonomedia, 2013) offers a passionate and poetical critique of neoliberal governance that meets in numerous ways À nos amis (La Fabrique, 2014), the last opus by the Invisible Committee. Refusing a conception of emancipation primarily mobilizing self-consciousness and auto-reflexivity, these two essays take ground in this “transe that’s under and around us” to develop a politics based on the arts of immanent attention and the powers of collective improvisation. They both rely on a strong conception of the “call” and attune to the idea that “to get organized doesn’t mean to subscribe to the same organization, but to act according to a common perception of the situation”.
