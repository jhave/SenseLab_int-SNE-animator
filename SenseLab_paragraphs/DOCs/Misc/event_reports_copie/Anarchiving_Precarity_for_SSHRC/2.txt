On the weekend of April 25-27, members of the Senselab collective met in the Eastern Townships for the Anarchiving: Precarity event. This event was one phase in our collaborative work that as been ongoing since the Spring of 2013 on the question of how to make a collectively constructed issue on precarity in a way that engages artistic forms outside of the written word.
