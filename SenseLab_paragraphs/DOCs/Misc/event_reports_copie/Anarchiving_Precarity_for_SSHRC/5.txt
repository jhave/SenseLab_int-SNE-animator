We eventually developed a set of procedures for anarchiving precarity inspired by our collective reading of Arakawa and Ginsâ€™ Architectural Body at Bioscleave: Entering the Event. These procedures were developed over months of experimenting with different procedural possibilities. The procedures were posted on our website (http://inflexions.org/anarchivingprecarity/procedure.html) in advance of our Anarching: Precarity event, and functioned as an entry point for the all three hubs Canada, Europe, Australia to procedurally synchronize their research-creation events. We connected our relational movement practices and through the use of Skype throughout the weekend. These relational movement practices were our procedurally chosen modes of exploring how the concept of precarity can be opened up onto questions of experience and perception, a concern that we arrived t through reading groups that we held on two afternoons of the event.
