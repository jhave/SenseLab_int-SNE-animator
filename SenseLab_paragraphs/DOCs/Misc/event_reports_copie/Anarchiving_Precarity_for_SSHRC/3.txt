We began by cultivating ideas around precarity circulating in the Senselab and solicited various submissions (of text, images, videos, sound recordings) from the members of the collective. We archived these contributions, and then at Bioscleave: Entering the Event we worked to activate that archive by creating a collective writing machine. With over 40 participants, we worked through a variety of strategies including experimenting with the interview form, “exquisite corpse” collective writing techniques, iPhone photography and storytelling in order to create a collective enunciation around precarity. The results of this collective enunciation was then added to our precarity archive, in the form of even more images, videos, short essays, poems, sound recordings and more.
