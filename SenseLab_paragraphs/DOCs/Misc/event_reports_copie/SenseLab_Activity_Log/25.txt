Ramona, Erin and Lynn met – spoke about design of bikes, started talking about kitchen designs. Taking the inside of the house to the outside of the street – ovens, cookware etc. Continue with that idea to bridge communities where the doors are usually closed. The bikes would be the garden, not the tool that pulls the garden. For example, using draws as planters. Thinking of a draw-drive or thrift store hunt through these communities. Start conversation with these groups through the collection of these objects.
