John, Ramona’s son, has connections with DB co-op in Brooklyn and gardener. He will be here for the event. Kenny got excited about the Cooper Union crew (DB co-op). If there’s a team on it we could make sure it functions.
Bike from Paris called a Poetry Bike. That’s the sort of thing we have in mind. Brian describes it as a sculpture made out of found objects. It looks otherworldly. The bike is not a carrier – make the bike the artwork/garden.
Ramona suggests that people who like that idea who want to get involved is something we’d need to get organized. Who is in Montreal that could get involved with making these bikes? 
Positive responses from: Brian, Erin, Alanna, Leslie, Virginia, Mayra, Marcellino and Elliot.
If we’re all in the process from the beginning we can invent what the bike looks like.
We need to brainstorm because we need a good mechanic. Welding system – we need someone with the right facilities. DB co-op’s system is that it needs to work and it needs to be safe. Building an attachment or a wagon is much safer than building a bicycle. 
In Montreal you used to see delivery bikes everywhere – wooden platform on the front. We have to start asking around to see where they are in the city. Charlotte should try and get in touch with the DB co-op to see how things work there. Charlotte sends email to DB co-op and visit one afternoon.
