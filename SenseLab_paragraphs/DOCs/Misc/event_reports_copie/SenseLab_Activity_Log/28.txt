Ramona cooked for 1300 people at the SAT with a grill and a flat hotplate which shows that things are possible working with minimum equipment.
Each of the three kitchen sites could be aesthetically similar – like a long table. Ramona thinks we can rent or borrow them. Fruiterie Mile-End has electricity.
In Outremont – get Cheskie’s involved (Hasidic bakery on Bernard). Both Hasidic and non-Hasidic community buy baked goods there. We could get baked goods from Cheskie’s. We could talk to Cheskie to be involved in something to be cooked in the bakery that could be eaten by the Hasidic community. Ramona not sure what the procedures would be to keep the space certified Kosher. Ways that everything gets overlapped. New relationships. Not sure if we’d be allowed in his kitchen. Have to look into this further.
