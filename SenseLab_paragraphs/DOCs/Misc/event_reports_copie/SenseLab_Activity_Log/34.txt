Siglinde posted picture of compost bike – instead of front wheel there’s a big recycling box. Ben and Siglinde have been working hard on building them in Maine.
Bikes and herbs – get a schedule going.
Make affinity groups so different people are doing different things with their energy. 
Ramona asks if anyone has a shop or a studio to build things?
Erin points out that we could use the SenseLab but it’s not a shop. Elliot has access to another space at Concordia – he will coordinate this aspect. Marcellino says we could use Concordia’s woodshop. We can use the SenseLab to store things, in the EV building in Concordia.
Do we need access to the metal lab? Ramona might be authorized because she’s an undergraduate. There are technicians in those spaces.
Alanna points out that there are 3D printers at McGill, which are also at Concordia and Patrick offered to do something with his. 
Re New York in October – in the next few weeks we need to think of an alternative to hold the October event in Montreal. Maybe Mekoos. What if we did the Bioscleave event six months later? Erin will contact Mekoos to see if there’s space available. But if it’s hunting season it may be a problem. $40 a person to stay there. Cabins have a woodstove. Convenient place to all be together with the inconvenience of it being a hunting lodge.
Once today’s Skype conversation concludes, let’s move to the Writeboard to form affinity groups. Mike is coming to Montreal August 1. 
Need to hunt a bike mechanic that’s innovative and interested. Maybe Alanna could contact McGill bike group. Dates are the same 22-25 for August event. Erin will speak to a bike shop near her house.
