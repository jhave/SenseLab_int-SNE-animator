Santropol farm – transplants available to us now. Seeds need 31 days. Beets chards, broccoli, basil or lettuce. Laura has season cuttings of green onions, coriander, little leaf basil, fennel. Erin has mint. Toni also wanted to contribute things he’s growing. Because Bob is offering food, maybe we should consolidate what we have on the bikes? Vegetable providing plants – curious.
Each bike should distinguish itself. Blender bike may find itself at Parc Ex but you may need it in Mile End. One with only herbs… one with only spices.
