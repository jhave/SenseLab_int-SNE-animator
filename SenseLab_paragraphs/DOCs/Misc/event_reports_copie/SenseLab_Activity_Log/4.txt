Description of research activity
The workshop in Boston was an opportunity for members of the SenseLab and ds4si to brainstorm and plan future collaborations. It included:
	•	a site visit of the design studio
	•	presentations of earlier interventions and youth projects (“The Grill”, “Let’s flip it”, “Public Kitchen”)
	•	conversations around the conceptual differences and resonances between SenseLab and ds4si
Schedule
Friday, May 17:
	•	10am – travel by car from Montreal to Boston 5pm to 10pm – presentations, open discussion of key concerns
Saturday, May 18:
	•	10am to 3pm – site visit at ds4si, presentation of previous projects
	•	All participants (including the ds4si members) were given 30 minutes or so to write/draw a concept, an idea, a thought generated by the discussions we previously had on a large sheet pinned on a wall (see photos by Leslie Plumb). The movement-workshop was prompted as an attempt to capture and make visible-felt the process of a collective, speculative gesture.
