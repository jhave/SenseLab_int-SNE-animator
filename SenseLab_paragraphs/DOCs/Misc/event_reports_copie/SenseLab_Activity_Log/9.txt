Movement Workshop (June 18, 2013)
Join us Tuesday @ 2pm for a two hours session called “unmapping the body’s architectures”. We’ll do some partner work with some Shiatsu techniques of body pressure and breathing, in order to explore how our bodies are doing and how could we travel through their neuro-tissue knots and passages. You don’t need any movement experience to do this, if you fancy a soft massage and have a desire to have a “my body feels great” kind of experience and are not afraid to touch or to be touched by others, then, please… do come by! 2pm – 4 pm at the one and only SenseLab Hope to see you there!
