This was the initial planning meeting, first group workshop for the Australian hub. We did discuss some basic planning. We also discussed and developed some concepts of active and affective listening (that is processual listening) that we developed further in the April Melbourne workshop and came into the end of year events and into the Fibreculture Journal issue to come.
