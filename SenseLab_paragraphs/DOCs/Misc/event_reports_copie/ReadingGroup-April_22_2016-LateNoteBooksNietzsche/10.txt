Description of the Activity: 
Following the recent discussions we had about Charles Sanders Peirce’s semiotic/philosophical theory and its non-anthropocentric approach, this activity was focused on the discussion of the first chapter of Friedrich Nietzsche’s Late Notebooks (Notebook 34). The reading plan is to stick with this book in order. One of the main concepts discussed was value and valuation. The idea of this reading came from the proposition “Society of Atoms”, the concept of value being at its heart.
