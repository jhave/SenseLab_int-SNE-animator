The infrastructure we received as part of the Art&D project ($90000) consist of a large dance floor (the Marley surface), a sewing machine and a serger, a computer (Apple laptop), a large-scale scanner/printer, and a small selection of sound and light equipment.  Other than the laptop, which no longer functions, the equipment is used regularly in all our activities. Below, we outline an exemplary activity that would make use of most if not all of the equipment. Also, for the first period of the Art&D project (2010-2015), the process of research-creation through a serie of events is described.
