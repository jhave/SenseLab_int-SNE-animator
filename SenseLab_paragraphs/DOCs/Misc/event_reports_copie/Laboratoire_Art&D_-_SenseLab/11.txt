The infrastructures give the minimal support for experimentation. The dance floor allows the SenseLab members to enter into movement sessions. Working and playing with images and texts are possible with the use of the printer and the scanner. For more formal exchanges, the projector and the sound system are really useful by providing video and sound support with an easy access.
