Here, itâ€™s important to underline that this serie of events had allowed for experimentation and thought growing across a large network of academics, artists, activists and thinkers. The period was also prolific in terms of research-creation results such as an inventive procedure of collaboration (see Enter Bioscleave) and the opening of the event concept. This period also led to a formal partnership application called Immediations project which was awarded by SSHRC for 7 years by almost 3 millions dollars and acknowledging the network built through the years. Also, this series of events is now turning into a large publication project.
