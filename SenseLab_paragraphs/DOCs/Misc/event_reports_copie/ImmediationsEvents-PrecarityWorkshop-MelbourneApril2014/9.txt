Event Description: 
An event for the gathering of the Australian Hub. Timed to co-incide with events in Canada and Europe. A skype link-up facilitated this simultaneity. A range of workshop exercises where experimented with (such as Whose water are You ?).
The word ‘precarity’ was written in braille, using fruit in a wall of gridded holes. This was part of leading toward an idea for a braille book that would be made collectively. 
A robot vaccuum cleaner made some films as we interacted with it. 
Organisational issues re Nov/Dec that year were discussed.
