Regarding Immediations research, we intended to experience study as a force that makes an event, and moves across different practices, bodies, thoughts and feeling. Out of a concern for the ways that knowledge and practice are combined in artistic research, this conception of study does not rely on any “official” beginning of the process as would be the case in more traditional educational contexts. In other words, study is always already happening, constantly creating new ways of thinking collectively.
