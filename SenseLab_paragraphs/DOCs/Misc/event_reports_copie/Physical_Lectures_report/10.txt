This symbolic and yet pragmatic site opened up the space for an experimental approach in how we can (or cannot) create a situation where open attention and sensorial perception becomes a source of knowledge. The meal-discussion in the dark was an attempt for disorienting us in order to redefine new ways of perception and communication. Sound experiments, vocalizations, breathing exercises, Deep Listening activities, the immersion in the senses and in silence were as much part of the event, as readings of poems, explorations in movement, the urge to leave, emergent activities, imporvised storytelling, rehearsed performance and one-by-one conversations.
