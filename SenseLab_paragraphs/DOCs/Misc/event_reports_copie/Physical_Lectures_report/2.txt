Physical Lectures is a series composed of a variety of experiential and innovative events designed to speak through the body, thus weaving expressions of body and thought together. It was initiated by the Department of Contemporary Dance in conjunction with the Departments of Studio Arts, Music and Theatre and is co-organized by multiple Senselab members and the Senselab community.
