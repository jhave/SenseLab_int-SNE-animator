The goal of the series is to shift the format of a lecture in order to edify an exciting type of somatic forum. Rather than creating artificial bridges between processes of the physical diffusion and written publication of knowledge, "Physical Lectures" seeks to fold the articulation of both physical knowledge and theory into a cohesive physical-intellectual experience. Questions around the topic of the body are: How is the body experienced, seemed, practiced, felt, thought, and discussed? How does experience differ from one disciplinary perspective to another? Could we change the way we talk about the body by speaking from it? And finally: Are these the questions that need to be asked or are there others that remain aside? By addressing these questions we intend to configure a platform for situating and displaying a panorama of research on practices of the body. 
Over the years a separation has developed between theory and practice that divides knowledge and its transfusion into categories of doers and thinkers. Discourses and practices around the body keep popping out in different disciplinary corners, yet interdisciplinary dialog seems to slip away from our current still isolated environments. “Physical Lectures” as an urgent response to these conditions.
