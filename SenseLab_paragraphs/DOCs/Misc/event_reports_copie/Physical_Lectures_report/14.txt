The first part was led by Bobby Thompson & Carol Horowitz. They are versatile dancer-choreographers-teachers who after touring for many years with a variety of internationally renowned dance companies, now devote their time almost exclusively to the Argentine Tango. They opened Studio Tango Montreal in September, 1997. They led a tango workshop, sharing their experience about the and operational traditions of Argentine Tango.
