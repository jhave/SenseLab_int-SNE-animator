Book description:  The Minor Gesture is a book that throws into question the dominant notion of personal agency by using process philosophy to consider how ecology activist comes to enunciation in such a way as to confound the liberal subject and its correlate assumptions about how thought and experience is articulated. The result is a book that explores how an ecology thinks in its own right through gesture.
