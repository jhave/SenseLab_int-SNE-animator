Book description:
Why shouldnâ€™t the autist study the neurotypical? Perhaps by doing so we may devise a more humble and hospitable society. In Plankton Dreams, Rajarshi Mukhopadhyay does just that, offering the reader an inside look at how autistic perception combines with the rationality of a philosopher and a strong authorial voice. Plankton Dreams opens the OHP Immediations series at the juncture of creative writing and empiricist philosophy, offering a convincing account of how neurotypicals could learn from autistic perception new ways of thinking about how experience is structured ecologically.
