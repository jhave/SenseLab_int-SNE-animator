As such, speculation is a notable and meaningful response, or set of responses, to
dynamic and complex social phenomena that cannot be held, observed and acted
upon without either the taking of risks or the experiencing of consequences. While it
sometimes connotes an activity of anticipation and even exploitation of expectations, in other cases it denotes an investment in the real possibility of grasping alternate futures. Indeed, one of the threads that runs through the various engagements with the speculative is a renewed interest in the possibility of extracting from the present certain immanent potentialities that may be capable of opening up a transition into otherwise unlikely futures. Furthermore, speculation can also work as a particular way of engaging with the dynamic and transformative nature of “things”: to explore their situated and contingent characteristics as well as their capacities to affect and be affected.
