Given the growing interest in and proliferating approaches to speculation in social
and cultural research, this edited collection aims to examine the multiple versions of
speculation while attending to their methodological, epistemological, ontological,
ethical and political implications. In so doing, the collection will address the
following questions: Can social and cultural research become speculative? What do
practices of speculation consist of and what modes of speculation are there? What
are the implications of allowing for speculation to ingress into the practices of social
research? What might speculative research offer to the re-invention of otherwise
seemingly intractable ‘problems’? How can speculation become a productive mode
of thinking, feeling and knowing, and not just a practice of conjecturing and
managing uncertainties?
