Book description: Once the preserve of metaphysicians, the notion of ‘speculation’ is now increasingly present as an approach signalling toward uncertain, possible or other presents and futures. Not only does it characterize some of the practices performed in financial markets that are now thought to be mainly culpable for the current contemporary socio-economic crisis, it is also an important operator in the many forecasting techniques that organize the social
(e.g. risk analysis and predictive genomics). Furthermore, speculation is also becoming a theoretical preoccupation that is part of developments in disciplines as varied as continental, pragmatist and process approaches to philosophy, art and design, fiction and literary theory, as well as media studies. For the social sciences, the ‘speculative’ is being taken up as a practico-theoretical approach to the reconceptualization of intractable sociocultural problems where more imaginative propositions and interventions are called for. In other words and in short, speculation acts as a means for asking more inventive questions.
