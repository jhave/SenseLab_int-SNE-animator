Book description: The work of Apichatpong Weerasethakul is often described as oneiric, magical, or supernatural. Nocturnal Fabulations proposes that the aesthetic singularity of Apichatpong’s cinema engages a political project in the key of speculative pragmatism. The authors of this book respond to this project to fabulate a politico-aesthetic paradigm in dialogue with Apichatpong. At the core of this  project – Apichatpong’s and ours – stand the care for an ecology beyond the human, the composition of a collective without consensus, and the affirmation of a future that negotiates Thailand’s war-torn history and current censorship laws. Nocturnal Speculations stages an encounter between different modes of thought, between the percepts of Apichatpong’s vitalist cinema and the concepts of our activist philosophy.
