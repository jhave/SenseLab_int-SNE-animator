The authors take seriously the Immediations book series’ directive: “reinvent the book.” Nocturnal Fabulations is neither edited anthology, nor coauthored manuscript, but a collection of interpenetrating essays with a sliding conceptual landscape that was written in and around the Senselab through having discovered that Apichatpong is an intercessor for our thought. Concepts such as fabulation, vitality, ecosophy, and opacity percolate throughout the essays in a way that adds depth and consistency to each essay by virtue of their being published together, and read in light of one another. The texts take a risk in style and tone by attempting to truly practice an immanent critique at an indiscernible, interdisciplinary limit of cinema studies, philosophy and research-creation by deploying concepts that emerge from within the aesthetic ecology of Apichatpong’s film universe in seeking to understand how it functions; a risk in the sense that the essays refuse to be overdetermined by shaping them to speak to pre-established disciplinary fields that could be expected of a book on Apichatpong (auteur studies, national cinema or “minor cinema” frameworks, “expanded cinema” discussions, etc.). For these reasons, Immediations is an ideal for the book and it should prove novel and useful to our readership.
