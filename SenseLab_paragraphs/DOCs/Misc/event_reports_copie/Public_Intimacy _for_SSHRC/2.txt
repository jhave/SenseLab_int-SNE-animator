Public Intimacy was a workshop featuring members of the Senselab, lead by Adriana Disman and guest facilitator Dani√®le Bourque. The workshop took place on May 9-10, and was designed to build on questions that were generated during the Knots of Thought around how affective states can be crafted in the public sphere. The workshops allowed for participants to develop their performance art practice through the expression of a variety of socio-political concerns around public space and affect. The workshops used meditation, buhto, dance and street theatre techniques to exploring the threshold of vulnerability as a catalyst for intimacy and intimacy as a catalyst for transformation. The workshops generated performance structures that facilitates intimate exchange with an outcome that is unknown and determined by the participants. In doing so, the workshops questioned intimacy's radical political potential, particularly when placed within the public sphere.
