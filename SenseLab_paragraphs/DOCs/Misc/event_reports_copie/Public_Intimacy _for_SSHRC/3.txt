By the end of the two day workshops, each participant had crafted two public performances which were performed publicly on the streets of Montreal (quartier Guy-Concordia). Adriana Disman provided each performer with feedback on how he or she could develop and refine their performances. Each of the participants created a written document at the end of the workshop that provided comments to one another.
