Bourque and Disman explore performance as teachers, critics, and co-performers. They are work on articulating the unseen of performance. Their most recent collaboration was an ephemeral sculpture for Xpace/Images Festival in Toronto for the exhibition Transcending Binaries, curated by Adrienne Crossman.
