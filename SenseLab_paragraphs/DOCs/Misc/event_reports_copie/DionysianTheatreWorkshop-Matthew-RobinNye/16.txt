An exploration of the ancient Greek tragedy The Bacchae, and improvisational group dynamics. The production and transfer of affect in a group scenario: working with the proposition the schizo is affect moving through the collective, while mania is when one (or more) affective forces are trapped within the individual, channeling Dionysus, the God of wine, uninhibited joy and instinct. Over the course of four meetings, led by theatre director Maude Watel Kazak, participants experimented with interpretation, embodiment, and transfer of experiences in crowds, creating pockets of heightened affective knots by attuning to the more-than human rhythms and forces within the event.
