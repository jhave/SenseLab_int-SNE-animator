A procedure for 'listening' is explored through reading the text a-loud and in the round (as a form of research-creation) by all the attendants of the meetings. Recursive and transversal tendencies emerge in these readings, foregrounding this activity as procedural in quality of experience. This answers our interests in designing for multiplicities, but in a non re-active or pre-emptive way. It is a way of working and activating 'precarity' across disciplines and through the collaboration of that event's activation of the concept.
