Meeting with editorial team to discuss submission for the precarity issue.
Explore potential ways of exploring the text through materials such as a paper. Discuss the development of the precarity issue in relation to the emergent techniques of activation excercised at  Justy's Precarity-Dinner (initiated in early fall):  oral story-telling, gathering and sharing a meals. 
Each person initiates their own individual research into potential materials to be used to create the issue.
