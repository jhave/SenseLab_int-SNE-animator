Description of the Activity: 
Both artworks addressed aspects of the Immediation research, investigating concepts concerned with the way that ecologies of relations immanently form, self-organising systems, trans-human agency , the primary role of force over form.
Weather Patterns was also an investigation into modes of artistic collaboration and collective thinking. Thsi work was developed through a residency in Montreal as part of the Immediations Project (see separate report).
Orgasmatron also tied in with key investigations in my post-doctoral research, in investigating the expansion of interactivity within a process-based philosophy.
