Context:
MOT was an opportunity to generate partnership between Senselab and Usine-C, as well as for the Senselab to open their internal research creation processes in physical movement (Movement Activation) to a wider public and interdisciplinary focus. For Usine-C it resonated with a desire to activate La Plancher (foyer) as a working space, for experimentation and networking.
