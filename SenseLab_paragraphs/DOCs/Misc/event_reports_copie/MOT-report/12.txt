	Description
	OmegaVille offers a platform for interdisciplinary collaboration around critical perspectives 	on planetary urbanism, towards a kind of speculative futurity for embodied praxis within 	everyday experience. These ideas are mobilised through a series of events, works, 	workshops and symposia, at the intersections of video, performance, sound, installation, 	mobile and interactive media. Theproject peers through the lens of Google Street View, via 	cross-platform media, to pose the question - how may we come to occupy infra/planetary 	bodies that are translocal and untimely, beyond the boundaries of skin and skull? How may 	this occupation occur through an ecology of practices that is political and ecological as 	much as social and technical?
