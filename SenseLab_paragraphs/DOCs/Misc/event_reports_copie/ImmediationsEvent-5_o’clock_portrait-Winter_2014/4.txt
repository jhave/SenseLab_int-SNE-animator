The next day’s activities saw many people departing, as well as the disassembling and take-down of our instillation on the COFA galleries, but this ‘last day’ would unfold without the urgency of a one time in which to say goodbye. Instead, the portrait event had became one of many. It introduced a rhythm for ‘ending’ and a sense of our collective disassembling, before it had even happened. It activated a different version of a collective ending, one that we hoped could become an endroduction - whereby the occasion could become the seeds for a something next.
