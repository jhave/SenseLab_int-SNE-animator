An appetite for multiplicities (as well as multiple techniques) for ending, has arisen many times over the course of all major SenseLab and Immediations events. As part of our ongoing investigation of ‘techniques for ending’, a proposition was made on the second to last day of the COFA events, to gather for a ‘5 o’clock’ portrait. This simple invitation implied that a traditional group shot would be taken on the steps of the courtyard, from the perspective of a single camera. However, we instead spiralled this portrait, bring multiplicity to the ‘portrait’ and attention to the process of assemblage, instead. This began by taking a continuous video shot of everyone assembling for the portrait. As is typical with large groups, this process of assembling held a multiplicity of rhythms (as well as arrival times), with people also folding into conversational groups that pulsed, migrated and fluxed across the space.
