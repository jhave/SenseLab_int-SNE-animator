People were then asked to distribute themselves across the steps for the portrait, further making palpable a collective rhythm for becoming and assembling. Once everyone had settled upon their locations, we then pulled back the single camera from the front, and invited everyone to take out their own cameras (usually those on their mobile phones) and to take their own ‘portraits’. In this way, there was no single perspective or ‘portrait’ taken that could pretend to hold that entire collective. Instead a multiplicity and polyphony of images and appetites for photo-taking, were deployed. People moved around with free mobility, to take shots with specific people and groups. ‘Selfies’ were most ubiquitous, as was the laughter. However the ‘work’ of these portraits lay not so much in the portraits themselves, or even the pretend capture of a moment in time, through the photos. The work lay in the time that was created through this propositional shift. The time for simply talking and being together in the sun on the steps of the courtyard foregrounded a version of a good-bye to one another, without it being officially ‘goodbye’.
