Description of the Activity: Research has been done concerning various alternative schools and educational practices that are being put forward (mainly in Europe and the Americas) and that could inspire the ongoing process of creation of the Three Ecologies Institute.
Some links have also been created with local organizations and actors who share the same philosophy the Institue is going to embrace.
